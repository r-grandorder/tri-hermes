Fou! 
Fou...Fou!

**Fujimaru 1:**
...What's that sound? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Feels like something just licked my cheek...

---
 
**A：???:**
...
 
**A：???:**
...Umm. Since it's neither morning nor night, please wake up, Senpai. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you? 
 
**A：???:**
That's a hard question to answer suddenly. Maybe I'm not important enough for you to know my name? 
 
**A：???:**
No, I do have a name. 
I have a proper name. 
 
**A：???:**
But I never really had the chance to use it...
I'm afraid I don't leave a good first impression...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where are we? 
 
**A：???:**
Right. That's a simple question. 
I really appreciate it. 
 
**A：???:**
This is the passageway from the front gate to the Central Command Room, which is in front of the Main Chaldea Gate. 
 
---
 
**A：???:**
...Ahem. Anyway, can I ask you a question, Senpai? 
 
**A：???:**
You were asleep, but I don't see why you'd sleep in the hall. Can you not sleep unless you're on a hard bed? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Was I sleeping here? 
 
**A：???:**
Yes, like a log. 
It was such a deep sleep, it was almost textbook. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes. I can't sleep unless I'm on a straw mat. 
 
**A：???:**
Oh, a Japanese carpet. I've heard of those before. 
I see...I see. 
 
---
 
**C：???:**
Fou! 
Kyuuu! Kyao! 
 
**A：???:**
...I completely forgot. 
I still haven't introduced you yet, have I, Fou? 
 
**A：???:**
This squirrel-like creature is Fou. He's a Privileged Life-Form allowed to freely walk around Chaldea. 
 
**A：???:**
Fou led me here, and that's how I ran into you, Senpai. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou. 
Mmkyu, Fou! 
 
**A：???:**
He ran off somewhere again. 
He does that sometimes, just walks around. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I've never seen an animal like that. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...What a mysterious creature. 

---
 
**A：???:**
Yes, normally he doesn't go near anyone aside from me,
but he seems to like you, Senpai. 
 
**A：???:**
Congratulations. Now you shall be the second caretaker of Fou in Chaldea. 
 
**D：???:**
Ah, there you are, Mash. That won't do, you know,
wandering about without permission...
 
**D：???:**
Oh, someone's already with you? You're...
I see...The rookie who just got assigned here. 
 
**Lev:**
I'm Lev Lainur, one of the technicians employed here. 
 
**Lev:**
And your name is? 
 
**Lev:**
Hmm, Fujimaru. 
So you're the last of the 48 candidates. 
 
**Lev:**
Welcome to Chaldea. 
I'm glad you're here. 
 
**Lev:**
I heard you were selected out of many public applicants, how long was your training? 
A year? 6 months? 3 months? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'll leave that to your imagination. 
 
**Lev:**
I see that you already know how competitive it is in here. 
You're going to hide your info from your rivals? 
 
**Mash:**
Dr. Lev, Fujimaru's training was less than a few hours. I think it's from embarrassment. 
 
**Lev:**
Oh? Well, now...I see. We had an emergency opening for applicants to fill out numbers. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, I didn't go through any training. 
 
**Lev:**
Oh? So you're a complete amateur? 
 
**Lev:**
Right...Come to think of it, we did call for applicants just to fill numbers. 
 
---
 
**Lev:**
So you're one of them? 
Do forgive me, I was inconsiderate. 
 
**Lev:**
But please don't be discouraged because you're a public applicant. We need all of you for this mission. 
 
**Lev:**
38 elite mages, plus 10 talented public applicants...
Somehow, we were able to gather all possible candidates. 
 
**Lev:**
That's something to rejoice over. This year, 2017, all possible candidates capable of Spiritron Dives were brought to Chaldea. 
 
**Lev:**
If there's something you don't understand,
feel free to ask Mash or myself anytime...Hmm? 
 
**Lev:**
Come to think of it, what were you talking about with {(M) him /(F) her}, Mash? That's not like you. Did you know each other before? 
 
**Mash:**
No, I'd never met Senpai before. 
I saw Senpai sleeping here, so I just...
 
**Lev:**
Sleeping? 
Fujimaru was asleep, here? 
 
**Lev:**
Ahh, you went through the simulation when you entered, right? Spiritron Dives can get to you if you're not used to them. 
 
**Lev:**
After the simulation, the gate must've opened and you walked over here before you returned to consciousness. 
 
**Lev:**
It's a type of sleep-walking. When you fell, Fujimaru, that was when Mash spoke to you. 
 
**Lev:**
You seem to be fine, but I'd like to take you to the infirmary just in case...
 
**Lev:**
Sorry, hang in there a little longer. The Director's orientation is about to start. You should hurry over. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Director? 
 
**Lev:**
The Director's the director. The person in charge of Chaldea, and the commander of our special missions. 
 
**Lev:**
Since you're a rookie from the public, you may have only seen the pamphlet? 
 
**Mash:**
It would appear so. 
Since the Director's profile hasn't been made public. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai has no connection to the Director. 
Only mages from families that have been around for over a century show respect to the Animusphere name. 
 
**Lev:**
Right. Well, whether you know the Director or not, it doesn't affect your work as a Master, so it's not a problem. 
 
**Lev:**
But it's good to not get on her bad side. If you wish to work in a peaceful environment, better hurry. 
 
**Lev:**
There's an orientation by the Director at the Central Command Room in 5 minutes. She's putting on a presentation for the newbies. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Orientation? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, to greet the Master candidates assigned here today like you, Fujimaru. 
 
**Lev:**
In other words, it's for the big boss to welcome the careless newbies. 
 
**Lev:**
Since the Director is not the type to forgive and forget, if you show up late, you'll be on her radar for the entire year. 
 
**Lev:**
The orientation begins in five minutes in the Central Command Room. Go straight down this hall. Hurry. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Dr. Lev, do you think I'll be allowed to sit in on the orientation, too? 
 
**Lev:**
Hmm? Well, if you stand way back in a corner,
I think she'll look the other way...But why? 
 
**Mash:**
I just thought I should take Senpai to the Command Room. It's possible that Senpai might fall asleep on the way again. 
 
**Lev:**
...If I leave you alone like this the Director might yell at me...I should tag along as well, eh? 
 
**Lev:**
Well, if that's what you want to do, Mash, go ahead. 
You okay with that Fujimaru? 
 
**Lev:**
If you have no other questions, let's head to the Command Room. Is there anything else you want to know? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have no questions. 
 
**Lev:**
All right, let's get going. 
Stand up straight, but remember to relax, okay? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why is she calling me Senpai? 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Lev:**
Oh, don't worry about it. 
To her, every human your age is her senpai. 
 
**Lev:**
But it's unusual to hear her actually call someone that. 
This might be the first time. 
 
**Lev:**
Actually, I'm intrigued. 
Say, Mash, why do you call {(M) him /(F) her} Senpai? 
 
**Mash:**
The reason? Fujimaru is the most human-like person I've ever met. 
 
**Lev:**
Hmm. Which means? 
 
**Mash:**
I don't feel threatened. 
So there's no reason for me to be hostile. 
 
**Lev:**
I see, that is important! 
People at Chaldea are all a piece of work! 
 
**Lev:**
I agree with you, Mash. 
I think you two will get along just fine! 
 
**Mash:**
...If you like Senpai Dr. Lev, the Director will probably hate Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
...Well, why don't we hide in the restroom to boycott the orientation, then? 
 
**Lev:**
That will only make the Director more upset. 
We're going to have to leave it to fate. 
 
**Lev:**
Shall we jump into the lions' den, Fujimaru? Hey, once you get used to her, she can be a pretty sweet person. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
This is the Central Command Room. Your number, Senpai...Single digit, you're in the front row. 
 
**Mash:**
Take an empty seat in the front row. 
...Senpai? You're looking a bit pale...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, I'm starting to space out again...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Sleepy ...So sleepy. 

---
 
**Mash:**
It's an after effect of the simulator. 
I wish I could take you to the infirmary...
 
**E：???:**
...
 
**Lev:**
No more small talk. 
See, the orientation's already begun. 
 
**E：???:**
Well, that wasn't on time, but looks like we're all here now. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea. 
I'm the director, Olga Marie Animusphere. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...Are you all right, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Uh-oh. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Wait, was I asleep? 

---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. 
It seemed like you were in REM sleep...
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, the Director's slap seemed to wake you up completely. Thank goodness. 
 
**Mash:**
You've been left out of the first mission, Senpai. 
I was taking you back to your room&mdash;Oh! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A squirrel on your face! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Watch out! 

---
 
**Mash:**
No, no, this is normal. 
No problem at all! 
 
**Mash:**
Fou likes to attack my face, slide around to my back, and settle on my shoulder. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you're used to that, huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It's been a year since Fou came to live here. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, are you the one who named him? 
 
**Mash:**
That's right. No special reason, the word "Fou" is the first thing that popped into my mind. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm impressed you knew that, Senpai. 
I see you're quite perceptive yourself. 
 
---
 
**Fou:**
Fou. 
Kuuu, Fou! Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
Hmm, hmm. Apparently, Fou's embraced you as one of his own, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
But can a squirrel who sees humans as rivals exist in this world? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He sees me as a rival? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't look at me, I have no idea

---
 
**Mash:**
Well, knowing Fou as I do, I'm sure he'll forget it by tomorrow. 
 
**Mash:**
Actually, we've reached our destination. 
This is your room, Senpai. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I see. Thanks for coming all this way. 
 
**Mash:**
It's fine. If you ask me, Senpai,
I wouldn't mind even if it's treating you to lunch. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What team are you on, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
First Mission, A Team. 
Speaking of which, I've got to head back now. 
 
---
 
**Fou:**
Kyu...Kyu! 
 
**Mash:**
Fou says he'll look after you, Senpai. 
That sets my mind at ease. 
 
**Mash:**
Now, then, I'm off. 
If we're lucky, I think we'll meet again. 
 
**B：???:**
Okay, I'm in here&mdash;Wait? 
Whaaaaaat? Who are you? 
 
**B：???:**
This is an empty room! It's where I slack off! 
Who gave you permission to come in? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I was told that this was my room...
 
**B：???:**
Your room? This place? Oh...
I see, so the last one finally showed up, huh? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, who are you? 
 
**B：???:**
Who am I? Isn't it obvious that I'm a healthy, diligent and hard-working doctor? 
 
---
 
**B：???:**
Well, nice to meet you, Fujimaru. Didn't think I would run into you like this, but let me introduce myself again. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm the head of the medical department, Romani Archaman. For some reason, people just call me Dr. Roman. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know why, but it's easier to pronounce, so go ahead and call me Roman. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fact is, Roman has a nice ring to it, no? 
It sounds cool and vaguely sweet. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice to meet you, Doctor. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, nice to meet you. 
I look forward to getting to know you. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Oh, so you're the fluffy type? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fluffy? Oh, you mean my hair? 
I'm normally pretty busy so I just let it grow. 
 
---
 
**Fou:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? On your shoulder - is that the mysterious creature I've heard so much about? Whoa, nice to meet you! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash told me a lot about him, but I didn't really think he existed...Hey, why don't I teach him some tricks? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, shake hand. 
If you do it well, I'll give you a snack. 
 
**Fou:**
...Fou. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh, what? He gave me a really pitying look and then completely ignored me...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-Anyway, I think I get what's going on. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're the rookie who just got here then got on the Director's bad side? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then you and I are alike. 
Just so you know, I got yelled at by her too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You know the Rayshift experiment's about to start, right? The entire staff's been sent to help out. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But since my job is to look after everyone's health. 
I had nothing to do. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The machines are more accurate at reading the vitals of the mages who are in the Coffins. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Director said, "When you're here, Romani, everyone slacks off! " Then she threw me out. So I've been sulking here. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But that's when you showed up. 
This is what they called a blessing in disguise right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Since we both have nowhere to go, why don't we spend some time and deepen our friendship! 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure. This is my room, anyhow. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. So that means I'm visiting a friend's room! 
Woo hoo! I've made a new friend! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's not like I'm a loner. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey...You already have a friend even though you just got here...What a people person! I want in! 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...So that's the structure of Chaldea. An underground workshop built on a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level...
 
**Lev:**
Romani, we're going to start the Rayshift soon. 
Could you come in case there's an emergency? 
 
**Lev:**
The A Team's in perfect condition, but B Team on down is less experienced and they are displaying some slight abnormalities. 
 
**Lev:**
It probably comes from anxiety. 
The inside of that Coffin is like a cockpit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey Lev, I feel bad for them. 
Why don't I give them some anesthesia? 
 
**Lev:**
Yeah, hurry up, will you? If you're in the infirmary, then you can get here in two minutes. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This isn't the infirmary, is it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...but you're just hiding and slacking...

---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa...Please don't mention that...
It's gonna take five minutes from here, no matter what...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I think they'll forgive me for being a little late. 
A Team has no issues anyway. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, that guy's named Lev Lainur. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's the mage who created the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba&mdash; A telescope used to observe that pseudo-planet, Chaldeas. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sheba not only observes Chaldeas, but also serves as a surveillance system for most of this facility. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also, it was the previous director who built the summoning/unsummoning system, which is the foundation of the Rayshift tech. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To actualize that theory, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculation Engine, (basically a super computer) was provided by the Atlas Academy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All these different talents have been gathered to carry out this mission. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's pointless for an ordinary doctor like me to be there, but if I'm summoned, I must go. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thanks for chatting with me, Fujimaru! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
When you get settled in, come by the infirmary. 
Next time, I'll treat you to some yummy cake. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's this? 
The lights are out. Did something&mdash;
 
**Announcement A:**
Emergency. Emergency. A fire has broken out in the Central Power Station and the Central Command Room. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Central Area's containment wall will activate in 90 seconds. All staff must evacuate from Gate 2 at once. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Containment wall will close in 40 seconds Those remain in Central Area, evacuate immediately&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Was that an explosion just now? 
What on earth is happening? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Monitor, show us the Command Room! 
Is everybody all right? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...So awful...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Command Room? What about Mash? 

---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's this&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, evacuate right now. 
I'm going to the Command Room. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The containment wall is about to close. 
Get yourself out before it's too late! 
 
**Fou:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can't just run away now...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know. Let's go save Mash! 

---
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, what are you doing? 
Wrong way, Gate 2's over there! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't tell me you're coming with me? 
Sure the more helping hands the better, but...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh man, there's no time to argue! 
Make sure you get back before it's too late! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No survivors. 
Only Chaldeas is safe. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This was where the explosion originated. 
This was no accident, it was sabotage. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Generator operation stopped. 
Power level critical. 
 
**Announcement A:**

Please make switch manually. 
 
**Announcement A:**

**Dr. Roman:**
...I'm heading down to the underground power station. 
We can't let Chaldea's light go out. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hurry up and go back the way we came. 
You can still make it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Listen, don't stop anywhere on the way! 
Go outside, and wait for help! 
 
**Fujimaru:**

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I should look for survivors till the last minute...

---
 
**Fujimaru:**
!!! 
 
**Mash:**
...Oh. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Hang in there, I'll get you out now! 
 
**Mash:**
...It's all...right. You can't...save...me. 
Don't mind me, please...Run. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(With those wounds, she's...)
 
**Mash:**
...That's right, thank you...For your understanding. 
Please Fujimaru, you need to...get out of here.

**Fujimaru:**

**Mash:**

180 seconds till internal containment procedure. 
 
**Mash:**
...they, shut off, the area. 
...Now, we can't, get out. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...That's right. We're in the same boat now.

## Section 1: Burning City
 
**???:**
Kyuu...
Kyuu. 
 
**???:**
Fou...
Fou...Fou...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...This sound...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It's like something licked my cheek again...

---
 
**???:**
Senpai. 
Please wake up, Senpai. 
 
**???:**
...Won't wake up. 
Maybe I should use the official title...
 
**???:**
&mdash;Master, please wake up. 
If you don't wake up, I will kill you. 
 
**Fujimaru:**
&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Thank goodness you're awake now, Senpai! 
I'm so glad you're safe. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, are you okay? 
 
**Mash:**
...I'll explain later. 
First, take a look around you, please. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you just say, "I will kill you? "
 
**Mash:**
That came out wrong. 
What I meant to say was, "you're going to be killed. "
 
**Mash:**
Um, I was confused because everything happened so quickly. As much as I want to gather our thoughts, please look around you. 
 
---
 
**???:**
Gi&mdash;GAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Linguistic communication impossible. 
&mdash;Identifying life-form as hostile. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, your orders, please. 
You and I will overcome this together! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;phew. 
I had my worries, but we made it somehow. 
 
**Mash:**
Are you hurt Senpai? 
Does your stomach hurt, or does it feel heavy? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What was that? 
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know. 
Something that doesn't exist in our era, let alone this era. 
 
**Mash:**
That was the cause of the Singularity, or something like it. I guess calling it that isn't too far off, or maybe it is. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, you're that powerful? 
 
**Mash:**
...No, in combat training I always had to stay after class. 
I couldn't even do a pull-up. 
 
**Mash:**
The reason I was able to fight like that just now&mdash;
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, I finally got through! Hello? 
This is Chaldea Command Room? Do you read me? 
 
**Mash:**
This is Mash Kyrielight, a member of A Team. 
At this time, I've completed the shift to Singularity F. 
 
**Mash:**
My sole companion is Fujimaru. 
Mind and body both intact. 
 
**Mash:**
Rayshift compatibility, Master compatibility both satisfactory. Please register Fujimaru as an official researcher. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...So Fujimaru also got dragged into the Rayshift, huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm impressed you didn't "lose your existence. "
I'm really glad. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also, Mash...Of course I'm glad you're safe, too...
But what's up with that outfit? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's shameless! 
I didn't raise you to dress like that! 
 
**Mash:**
I transformed into this. 
I couldn't protect Senpai wearing Chaldea's uniform. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What do you mean by transformed, Mash? 
Did you hit your head? Or was it that...
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Dr. Roman. Please be quiet. 
 
**Mash:**
Please check my condition. 
I think you'll understand the situation better. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Your physical condition? 
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Physical strength, Magical Circuits, everything's improved! You're not so much a human, but&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I'm a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't remember how it happened, but it seems I have survived by fusing with a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
To investigate and resolve Singularity F, a Servant was provided in advance at Chaldea. 
 
**Mash:**
This Servant lost its Master in that explosion, and was doomed to vanish. 
 
**Mash:**
But at the last second, he offered me a contract. 
 
**Mash:**
In return for the abilities and Noble Phantasm of a Heroic Spirit, he wanted me to eliminate the cause of this Singularity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Heroic Spirit and a human, fused...
A Demi-Servant? That's Chaldea's sixth experiment. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. So it finally succeeded, huh? 
Does this Heroic Spirit still have his consciousness? 
 
**Mash:**
...No, he gave me his combat abilities then vanished. 
 
**Mash:**
He never revealed his True Name even at the end. 
So I don't even know whose Heroic Spirit I am...
 
**Mash:**
...Nor what kind of Noble Phantasm I'm holding. 
At this point there's too much I don't know. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, look on the bright side. 
Not every Servant who gets summoned is cooperative. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now that you're a Servant, this is in our favor. 
After all, you're completely trustworthy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, it looks like you're the only one who Rayshifted there safely. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also, I am sorry. 
Forcing you into this without any explanation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure you're full of questions, but try not to worry. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You've already got a powerful weapon. 
Humanity's most powerful weapon - Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't know about "most powerful. "
I'm the one who gets blamed later. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now, now, as long as Fujimaru understands that's what a Servant is, it'll be fine. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But Fujimaru, while Servants can be reliable allies, they also have a weakness. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They disappear without their magical energy source. 
Their Master. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm still analyzing the data, but it's indicating that Mash has become your Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Meaning that you're Mash's Master. She's the first Heroic Spirit you've entered a contract with. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm Mash's Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uh, I can't keep up with what you're saying...

---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, I don't blame you for being confused. I never explained what Masters and Servants are to you, anyway. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now's a good time, I'll explain it to you in detail. 
The current mission has two new goals...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, you're breaking up. 
10 seconds until the connection is lost. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh, so Sheba's output is unstable because we switched to the backup generators? Oh well, I'll brief you later. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Both of you, I'm getting a strong leyline reading about 2 km from where you are. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Try to get there somehow. 
That way, it will stabilize our connection. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Listen, don't do anything reckless, will you? 
I'll try to bring the power back up as soon as&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The connection got cut off. 
 
**Mash:**
Well, that's the Doctor for you. 
You can't rely on him in situations like this. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It can't be helped, let's get going. 
 
**Mash:**
Right, you're so dependable Senpai. 
I was actually terrified, so thank goodness. 
 
---
 
**Fou:**
Kyu. 
Fou, Fooou! 
 
**Mash:**
That's right, you're with us as well, aren't you Fou? 
Thank you for cheering us up. 
 
**Mash:**
Apparently, Fou Rayshifted here with you Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
...Ah. But I forgot to let the Doctor know...
 
**Fou:**
Kyu. 
Fou, kyaao! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He said, "don't worry about that guy. "

---
 
**Mash:**
You're right. 
I'll find the right time to let him know about Fou later. 
 
**Mash:**
First, let's head to the coordinates he mentioned. Once we get there, we should be able to set up a base camp. 
 
## Section 2: To the Spirit Meridian
 
**Mash:**
Senpai. 
We will soon reach the point Doctor specified. 
 
**Mash:**
There are only flames as far as the eye can see. 
It's nothing like the Fuyuki in our data. 
 
**Mash:**
According to our data, it's an average regional city. 
There's no record of such a disaster occurring in 2004...
 
**Mash:**
The Mana density in the atmosphere is also abnormal. 
In fact, it's a lot like ancient Earth...
 
**???:**
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What was that scream? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm getting a bad feeling. 

---
 
**Mash:**
It was a woman's scream for sure. 
Let's hurry over, Senpai! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Wh-Who are these guys, anyway? 
Why do these things keep happening to me? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I can't take it anymore! Come save me, Lev! 
You were always there for me right? 
 
**Mash:**
Director Olga Marie? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Y-You two! 
What in the world is going on here? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
The battle is over. 
Are you hurt, Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...What's going on? 
 
**Mash:**
Director? About my situation. 
I know it's hard to believe, but the truth is&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
A Demi-Servant, right? 
It's pretty obvious that you fused with a Servant. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What I want to know is why it's successful now all of a sudden! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Enough of that. You! 
The civilian who showed up late to my speech! 
 
**Fujimaru:**
!? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
How did you become a Master? 
Only first-class Mages can enter contracts with Servants! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
There's no way you could ever become a Master! 
What did you do to her to have her do your bidding? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You are way off base! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, don't look at me...

---
 
**Mash:**
There's a misunderstanding, Director. 
I'm actually the one who forced the contract. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What did you say? 
 
**Mash:**
I'll explain how it happened. That way we can understand each other's situation better. 
 
**Mash:**
...And that's how it happened. We were dragged into a Rayshift, and teleported here to Fuyuki. 
 
**Mash:**
No other Master candidates shifted with us. 
You're the only human we've run into, Director. 
 
**Mash:**
But this gives me hope. If you're here, that means there must be other candidates who got teleported here...
 
**Olga Marie:**
...There aren't, actually. 
That much I'm certain of. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...I hate to admit it, but I know why we were shifted to Fuyuki. 
 
**Mash:**
So you understand why we survived? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
All of us here share a common denominator. Neither me, nor you, nor that one "were actually inside the Coffins. "
 
**Olga Marie:**
Though Rayshifting flesh and blood isn't likely to succeed, it's not impossible. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Meanwhile, the coffins have breakers. 
When the success rate's below 95%, the power's cut off. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
So they never actually Rayshifted. 
We're the only ones here. 
 
**Mash:**
I see. That's why you're the director. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can be reliable when you're calm, I see. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What's that supposed to mean? 
Are you saying I'm not usually calm? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? You weren't planning to shift, Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Is that a problem? What commander heads to the front lines? Didn't I tell you that you were my tools? 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Hmmph, whatever. 
I understand the situation now. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Fujimaru, since it's an emergency I'll approve you and Kyrielight's contract. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
From here on out, you'll follow my commands. 
First, let's set up a base camp. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Listen, this is the time to search for a Leyline Terminal. 
A place where magical energy converges. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
There we'll be able to contact Chaldea. 
So in this town's case...
 
**Mash:**
This is the point, Director. 
The Ley point is at your feet. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Whoa! Oh r-right, I knew that, I knew that, of course! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Mash, place your shield on the ground. I'm going to set up a summoning circle, with your Noble Phantasm as the catalyst. 
 
**Mash:**
...So she says. 
Are you all right with that, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure, go ahead and do it. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not about letting go of the weapon. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...Understood. 
Now let us begin. 
 
**Mash:**
This is...The same as the summoning experiment chamber at Chaldea. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
CQ, CQ. Hello, hello? 
Okay, the connection's back! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good job, you secured the connection. 
Now we can communicate again, and even send rations...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Huh?! Why are you running the show, Romani? 
What about Lev? Where's Lev? Put Lev on! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Waaaahhhhhhhhh! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
D-Director, you're alive? 
And you're unharmed? What the...
 
**Olga Marie:**
What's that supposed to mean? Where's Lev? 
What's the head medic doing in charge? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't ask me why. 
I'm fully aware that I'm not cut out for this job. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But there's nobody else, Olga Marie. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Currently, the surviving full time staff of Chaldea is less than twenty people, including me. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The reason I'm in charge of operations is because there's no one ranked higher than me who survived. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Dr. Lev was supervising from the Command Room. 
There's no way he could survive that blast. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No way&mdash;Lev...
No, forget that, wait...please wait. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Less than 20 survivors? 
What about the Master candidates...the coffins? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...47, all in critical condition and we're short on medical supplies. We might be able to save a few, but all of them might be&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
Don't be ridiculous! Cryopreserve them immediately! 
Think about reviving them later. Your top priority is to make sure they don't die! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I forgot the coffins had those functions! 
I'll get on it right away! 
 
**Mash:**
...That surprises me. 
Cryopreservation without prior consent is a crime. 
 
**Mash:**
Yet you made the decision right away. You put human lives ahead of your own reputation as the director. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Don't be stupid! As long as they're not dead, I can explain myself later - why else? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
In the first place, 47 lives...
There's no way can I carry that burden! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Please don't die...I'm begging you...
If only Lev were here! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...This concludes my report. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chaldea has lost 80% of its functionality. 
There's only so much that the remaining staff can do. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm shifting available manpower to Rayshift repairs, and maintaining Chaldeas' and Sheba's current states. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As soon as external communications are back up, we'll request supplies and start rebuilding Chaldea. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's fine. 
I would've done the same if I were there. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Ah. Romani Archaman. I don't like it, but until I return you're in charge of Chaldea. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Make the Rayshift repairs your top priority. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
We'll be investigating this town. 
The Singularity F. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Director, you're not afraid to be at ground zero? 
Since when did you become so brave? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Seriously, you don't know when to shut up. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'd like nothing better than to go back now, but it's going to take time till you finish the Rayshift repairs. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
This town only contains low-level monsters, with Mash as a Demi-Servant we'll be safe. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Accident or not, we Animuspheres pride ourselves on doing our best in the situations we're given. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'll be looking into Singularity F with Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight as investigators. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That said, since my field staff is inexperienced, the extent of this mission will be to discover the cause of this anomaly. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Analysis and eradication will have to wait until after Chaldea's restored, and I can send in a second team. You okay with that? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Only discover it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That would be nice and easy. 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Roger that. Best of luck to you, Director. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We can now communicate in short bursts. 
Feel free to contact me in an emergency. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Huh! Even if we sent an SOS, nobody would come to our rescue. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Nothing, I'm cutting off the connection. 
Go do your job. 
 
**Mash:**
...Director, are you sure about this? 
There's also the option of waiting here for rescue. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I can't afford to do that...After we return to Chaldea, who knows how long it will take to select the next team? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
A month won't be enough to gather personnel or funds. 
Do you know how much the Association will harass me in the meantime? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Worst case, they'll blame me for mismanagement, and I'll lose Chaldea to them. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
If that came to pass, I'd be toast. I can't go back empty-handed. I need something that will shut them up! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Sorry, but you're both stuck with me,
Mash, Fujimaru. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Come on, let's explore this town. The cause of this twisted history must be here somewhere. 
 
## Section 3: Investigate the Bridge
 
**Olga Marie:**
Stop. Before we start exploring the city,
Fujimaru, isn't there something you want to say to me? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, nothing in particular. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, nothing in particular. 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
...You're not very smart are you? 
Remember what happened in the Command Room? 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, it's probably about when you dozed off in the Command Room. 
 
**Mash:**
It'll come back to you if you focus. 
That was, you know&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
We made it in time. Senpai, your number is...
A single digit, in the front row. 
 
**Mash:**
Please take any available seat in the front row. 
Right in front of the Director, what a bad luck. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...
 
**Lev:**
Let's cut the chit-chat. 
It's about to start. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Not quite on time, but it looks like everybody's here. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea. 
I'm the director, Olga Marie Animusphere. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare talents. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
By talent, I mean your aptitude for Spiritrons. People with magical circuits capable of becoming Masters. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm sure you can't even imagine it, but be sure to keep this in mind. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You are about to be reborn as cutting-edge mages, in an unprecedented fusion of magecraft and science. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That said, although all of you possess special talents, none of you are special. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Understand that you're all inexperienced rookies, standing at the same starting point. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
In particular, the mages sent from the Association still seem to be acting like students. Fix that immediately. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea is my domain. Family heritage and personal achievements have no meaning here. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Always remember that my orders are absolute. 
My position is completely different from yours. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I won't allow arguments. 
You're all mere tools to protect humanity, nothing more. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...What's that commotion? Didn't I just tell you that I wouldn't allow any arguments? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You there. The one who came in late. 
Do you have a problem with what I just said? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Yawn. 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
Uh...Am I seeing this right? 
Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Sleeping while standing...
No way, right? Not in a million years...
 
**New Hire (Female):**
Hey, I didn't sign up for this! We're experts who were summoned here because of our skills! 
 
**New Hire (Female):**
We came all this way on your insistence. 
Absolute obedience? That's ridiculous! 
 
**New Hire (Male):**
She's right, you're way overstepping! 
 
**New Hire (Male):**
Lineage is the most important asset for a mage! 
How can you brush it off? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Quiet! No talking! 
That's why I say you're still acting like students! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm only telling you what's going on right now. 
If you don't like it, leave Chaldea at once! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Not that there are flights to send you home. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Though if you're ready to trek down a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level, that would be commendable. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Very good! Nobody's dropped out. Seriously,
don't make me waste my time on such matters. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I wish you'd realize that's how dire our, no, humanity's situation is now. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Look. {(M) He /(F) She} is a good example. 
No argument, no opinion. Good and obedient. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Now, then, back to the topic. 
Are you listening? Today is&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Do you remember now, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Vaguely, I guess. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...In a way. 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
Remembered...You weren't really listening after all, were you? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Honestly! Sit yourself down! How could you come to a Singularity not knowing the situation or your mission? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm going to have to explain it to you again. 
Listen up! We at Chaldea&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Director, leave that for later. 
Enemies are incoming! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right! Good timing! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go, Mash! 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
Hey, come back here! 
Listen to what I have to say! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Phew. Good work, Mash Kyrielight. 
Now I can pick up where I left off. 
 
**Mash:**
Resume...You mean there's more, Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Why, certainly! Fujimaru! 
Don't tell me you forgot already! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm only half way through! 
In fact, it's the latter half that's important! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Make yourself remember! 
Make...your...self...re...mem...ber! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Guess I have no choice. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...What a piece of work. 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now, now, don't be like that. Director's ramblings can be useful, Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why were you Master candidates summoned to Chaldea? This will explain that. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Listen up. Today of all days, we at Chaldea will achieve something that will be written in history. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The science of learning. The invention of religion. 
The acquisition of navigation. The focus of communication. The voyage into space. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Our legacy will be on par with the "Pioneers of the Stars. " No, it will surpass them. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Rather than expanding civilization, we will be the hands of God protecting it. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Stabilizing human history, we will transform the future into a solid resolution. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The principles of mankind&mdash;
in other words, to ensure the continuation of humanity. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That is Chaldea's, and now your only and absolute purpose. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea has achieved many results to date. 
The development of observation cyber daemon, Laplace. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The Global Environment Model, Chaldeas. 
Completion of the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate, and the launch of the Spiritron Calculation Engine, Trismegistus. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
With these technologies, we at Chaldea have observed humanity's progress one hundred years into the future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
We do not predict the future, but observe it. Like many who observed celestial bodies, Chaldea has been observing the future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Whatever it sees, our job has been to ensure that humanity will survive 100 years into the future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Look up. That is Chaldea's proudest achievement&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
Created with advanced magical theories, the Global Environmental Model, our Chaldeas. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Planets have been defined as beings with souls. 
We copied them into this miniature Earth. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Because of the difference in scale, we are unable to read each single human mind. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
But whatever's on the surface, the city lights that can be seen on land, can be observed through Sheba. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Currently, it's been set to reflect the Earth one hundred years from now. Chaldeas may very well be the future of Earth itself. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
As long as the light of civilization shines within Chaldeas, we can guarantee humans will exist a century further. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
As long as there's light people will live in cities, and serve as proof of civilization's survival. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
But&mdash; Lev, could you normalize Sheba's polarization angle? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
This is the current state. Starting six months ago, Chaldeas changed color, and it's become difficult to observe the future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The light of civilization, our beacon till now, has become largely unobservable to us. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Hmph, the right response. 
Good to see you've got some sense. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's right. The lack of light means that civilization has become extinct. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
This was considered highly classified, but you have the right to know. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Our observations indicate that the light of humanity is only visible up to the year 2018&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
In other words, we've observed, no, proved that humanity will become extinct in that year. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Obviously, this future is not possible. 
It cannot happen, and physically speaking, is impossible. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
There's neither an economic collapse nor some sudden seismic event. We can't explain how humanity would suddenly just disappear. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Over the past six months, we've found the cause of this strange phenomenon&mdash;the disappearance of the future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
If the reason is not in the present, then it is in the past. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Using Laplace and the Trismegistus, we've reviewed all data for the past 2000 years. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
We tried to find something that didn't exist in history, or was on Earth until this point in time. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
As a result, we finally found something new. 
It's this&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
Spatial Singularity F, a city in the Japanese countryside in 2004. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
We discovered an "unobservable zone" that did not exist in history up to the year 2017. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea hypothesizes that this is the cause for humanity's extinction. We proposed the Rayshift experiment to the U. N. and received approval. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The Rayshift process transforms a human into spiritrons, sending them into the past and allowing them to alter it. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Simply put, it's time travel. But not everyone can do it. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Only people with exceptional magical circuits, and the ability to become a Master, can be transformed. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Now&mdash; I'm sure that cleared things up. 
Your task is the investigation of Singularity F. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You'll travel 14 years into the past, find Singularity F, and destroy it. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
We are now entering unknown territory. 
There's no telling what you might find there. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
But you've been selected from among people all over the world. You can do this, and we have high expectations for you. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The higher-ups want to know the cause of this immediately. We don't have time to waste. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
We'll be performing the first Rayshift experiment in an hour. I'm sure you've all had enough training. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
For the first experiment we'll send Team A, the top 8 scorers, to Singularity F. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I haven't told the later groups, but they're Master candidates who have been chosen from Chaldea. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Team A has been active for a month now. 
You can call them trained warriors. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Team A will go on ahead and establish a base camp at Singularity F, guaranteeing your safety. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Teams B and below will monitor their situation and prepare for the next experiment. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Let's register your information with the Klein Coffins, the arks that will send you to the past as spiritrons. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
There's one for each person, and there are no spares. 
Be very careful with them. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Teams B through D will be on standby, in case of trouble with Team A. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
&mdash;What are you doing? 
I told you what you have to do. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You were brought here as a potential Master. 
You're practically a soldier now. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You will obey orders and be ready for a fight. 
Do not make me repeat myself. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Or do you have more questions? 
Hey you, the one who was late! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You look confused. 
I'll give you the chance to ask one question. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is time travel possible? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it safe to change the past? 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
...
Does the word "Singularity" mean nothing to you? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The singularity we found doesn't exist in any of our observation records. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
It's like a hole that just appeared out of nowhere. 
The hole itself is cut off from the proper temporal axis. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The 2004 singularity exists apart from the past and future. There's no need to connect it to our present. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
It's more stable than regular time travel, and whatever happens the timeline can still repair itself. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Singularity F is like a tiny stain on the dress that is human history. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
It ruins beauty just by its presence. 
Your job is to extract it. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's what will return humanity to its proper, observed course of history. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...What is the Association thinking, sending me someone who doesn't know basic spacetime theory? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I told them this plan was a Grand Order, the highest possible duty in the world of magecraft...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Well, it doesn't matter. What team are you with? 
...Show me your ID. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What? You're in the wrong spot! 
A civilian, and with no combat or training experience? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea is much too important to be wasting valuable slots on people like you! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Lev! 
Lev Lainur! 
 
**Lev:**
I'm right here, Director. 
Why the yelling? Is there a problem? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
There're problems everywhere! 
Just get this amateur out of my sight! 
 
**Lev:**
Oh...so that's it? 
Director, {(M) he /(F) she} is a chosen Master candidate. 
 
**Lev:**
Sure they lack experience, but it's inappropriate to be that rude...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Having an inexperienced amateur here is a problem! 
What if something happens to my Chaldeas? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Let Romani handle this! 
At least get some basic training in! 
 
**Lev:**
...Hmm, I don't think she likes you. 
All right, orders are orders. 
 
**Lev:**
Mash, show Fujimaru their room. 
 
**Mash:**
All right, understood. 
I just need to take Senpai to their room, right? 
 
**Lev:**
Yes, thanks. 
I'm busy with the Rayshift experiment and can't. 
 
**Lev:**
Don't worry. This experiment will be over in 2 hours. 
I'll drop by your room then. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you. 
 
**Lev:**
No need to thank me. 
You're really lucky, after all. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 
**Mash:**
That's unusually kind of you, Dr. Lev. 
Do you know each other from somewhere? 
 
**Lev:**
Not at all. I was just thinking things like eternal rivals and fated encounters are very important. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Come this way. 
I'll show you to your room. 
 
**Mash:**
And that's how you were removed from the Command Room. Remember? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Got it. 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
You little...
You look quiet, but you've got some nerve, don't you? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Anyway! Do you finally remember how much of a mess you made at that critical moment? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, Director Marie? 
I think that's going a little too far...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Like hell it is! Thanks to the time I wasted on your question I didn't have time to change! 
 
**Mash:**
Uh...You weren't planning to dive, so I'm not sure you needed your suit...
 
**Olga Marie:**
I did! I most certainly did! 
I had a special Mystic Code made for this mission. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Jeez, I didn't even get to wear it once...
Well, it doesn't matter. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Anyway, you understand your responsibilities and duties as a Master candidate now, right? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Very well, Fujimaru. 
I'm ordering you to be my bodyguard. Work hard. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aye-aye, oh great Director Marie! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
W-What? That's creepy. F-Flattery will get you nowhere! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Are you trying to be someone you're not? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
This is who I am! I was just in a hurry back there! 
Once we get back to Chaldea, you're in for it. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...Good to see you two getting along. 
Let's move before more enemies show up. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Olga Marie:**
By the way, the type of being we call Servants, you know what they are, don't you? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have no idea. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Just as I thought. 
It can't be helped. I'll tell you as we move. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Think of a Servant as the highest-ranked familiar in the magical world. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Various historical heroes. Noble acts. Concepts. 
They're all summoned as spiritual bodies. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Whether or not a hero truly existed, he or she is still "information that was produced on Earth," right? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
To summon a Heroic Spirit is to convert the information stored on this planet into something for the good of mankind. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
People today have the right to use legacies of the past, and with that right, the duty to leave behind a future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Do you see? What you made your contract with is greater than a human, and yet is a tool to serve humans. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's why they're called Servants. Even if they're gods, they exist only to serve their Masters. 
 
**Mash:**
Director. Your line of thinking may be extreme. 
My cells are not agreeing with what you just said. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Hmph. Meaning the Servant you fused with must be an Earth-type Heroic Spirit. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I do have some basic knowledge. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Glad to hear it. Now I won't have to explain rudimentary things like what a Heroic Spirit is. 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
Servants are heroes of the past made into familiars. 
Those who enter into a contract with them and use them are Masters. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
There are seven classes of Servants, which vary depending on a Servant's legends and abilities. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
It's incredibly difficult to copy a Heroic Spirit entirely. 
Human mages do not have enough resources or memory to achieve such feat. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's why only one aspect of a Heroic Spirit is fixed in our world, resulting in the seven classes&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, Assassin. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Every Heroic Spirit will manifest as one of these classes. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's the true nature of Servants...
It's also a way to hide their True Names, as well. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
They hide their names because they are famous. 
Take Achilles from Greek Mythology. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Achilles is an invincible Heroic Spirit, but his weakness is extremely famous, right? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
When a Heroic Spirit returns, their weakness returns with them. That's why Servants hide their names behind their class names. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
If you don't know their identity, it's harder to figure out their past or weaknesses, right? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's not all. 
There's another reason for hiding one's True Name. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
A Servant has a secret weapon worthy of their legend. 
The crystallization of that Heroic Spirit's miracle and existence. 
 
**Mash:**
Director, sorry to interrupt you while you're having fun but we've detected hostiles. Entering combat. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What! T-Take them out right now! 
I-I'll be hiding over here! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Olga Marie:**
&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can feel the tension across the screen...
The Director is grumpy as usual. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's not just grumpy, she's a total crank. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why is she always so mad? 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Well, I can feel some sympathy for the Director's ill temper. 
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, but Fujimaru Senpai, there's too much about Chaldea you don't know. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-You really think so? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, I admit I came here clueless...
 
---
 
**Mash:**
I really don't know what to do with you. 
It's like you're a lost little kitty. 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Well, not that I'm any different. 
 
**Mash:**
It's been about two years since I started here, and I still don't get it. I kind of sneaked in. Almost like an alligator. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-Is that right? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
True, alligators have no clue. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I've learned as much as I can from the database. 
But I'll share it with you. 
 
**Mash:**
Chaldea Security Organization. Or more accurately,
the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity, Fenis Chaldea. 
 
**Mash:**
A research observatory with the purpose of continuing and strengthening human history, with researchers, scholars, and mages from all around the world. 
 
**Mash:**
They watch a world that magecraft couldn't observe, and science couldn't measure. 
 
**Mash:**
We're a special organization with national support, created to prevent humanity from reaching a "bad end. "
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You sure know a lot, Mash. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, I figured. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, that's pretty much it. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
It's true that Chaldea receives financial support from across the globe, but the majority of that comes from the Mage's Association in London&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
From the the Animusphere family. 
Director Olga Marie's family. 
 
**Mash:**
Chaldea is a research organization, but due to its importance, it operates on a military level. 
 
**Mash:**
There are extremely strict rules and punishments for everything, so the Director's attitude is actually reserved. 
 
**Mash:**
The Director isn't a villain, but she is evil. 
She'll get rid of any staff member she doesn't like. 
 
**Mash:**
Well, I'm not sure if it's okay to call someone who's got a bad attitude, evil. 
 
**Mash:**
...Sorry, I wanted to give you some encouragement, but I'm not used to cheery words. 
 
**Fou:**
Kyu. Kyu, kyu! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Whaaaaaaat? 
Hey! What are you guys doing? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Behind you! Behind you! 
The e-enemy's found us! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Prepare for battle! 
 
**Mash:**
They're so close! 
Senpai, give me your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Olga Marie:**
Sigh...Please keep an eye on your surroundings. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Even if Romani is monitoring us, this is a Singularity. 
There's no telling what might happen. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Come here, Kyrielight. 
You're hurt, aren't you? I can heal something like that. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh...right. 
Thank you very much, Director Olga Marie. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Really, now. 
When the director is calm, she can be dependable...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, you should know...
The director is in a complicated position as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Initially, Marie was like you all, a Master candidate. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Three years ago, the previous director, her father, passed away and she had to take over Chaldea when she was just a student. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Since then it's been one tense day after another. 
She had to take over as head of the Animusphere family. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It was all she could do to keep Chaldea running. 
Around that time, an anomaly was found in Chaldeas. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We could no longer see into the promised future of 100 years from now. There was huge criticism from the Association and our sponsors. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She was ordered to get the situation back to normal as soon as possible. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To make matters worse, they found that she had no aptitude to be a Master. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The noble Animusphere family, one of the Twelve Lords, the dominating faculty of Astronomy at the Mage's Association. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh the scandal that would occur if the head of such a family was found to be unfit to become a Master. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You can imagine the level of gossip happening behind the scenes. I'm sure those rumors reached Marie too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She still worked to be her absolute best as Director. 
This last half-year, she's just barely been hanging on. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's worked herself so hard, I'd like her to come for counseling, but with how things are...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In any event, she's been emotionally stretched to the limit. She doesn't hate you, or anything like that. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know. Director Marie isn't an evil person. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm glad you think so. 
But you know she is evil, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She isn't cruel, nefarious, and dishonest, that I can promise you. She's just a rather serious person. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I was just having fun. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, that's not nice! But I understand how you feel. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Director wasn't allowed to go out much growing up, so everything she says is honest and innocent...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But make sure you don't say that in front of her. 
She'll just hate you more. 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyhow, you're the only three I can trust right now. 
I want you to continue investigating without fighting. 
 
## Section 4: Investigate the Port Ruin
 
**Mash:**
The hostile lifeform has been removed. 
Let's move on. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I didn't know what would happen with that monster, but I expected nothing less of a Servant's body. Such power. 
 
**Mash:**
Not that it makes them look any less scary...
By the way Director, I have a question for you. 
 
**Mash:**
The Fuyuki in our data, and this Fuyuki are just too different. 
 
**Mash:**
What happened in this city, exactly? 
What are your thoughts, Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Let's see, history must've been slightly disrupted. 
That's the only reason I can think of. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Mash, Fujimaru. 
I'm only going to say this once, so listen up. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea observes the future through an Earth model called Chaldeas. At the same time, a familiar called Laplace compiles past records. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You can say it is Laplace's job to gather data on history that wasn't made public, and information that was buried in darkness that no one knows. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
According to Laplace's observations, an unusual Holy Grail War was confirmed in this city in 2004. 
 
**Mash:**
Holy Grail War? 
You mean the Holy Grail from the legend? 
 
**Mash:**
The magical chalice that is the root of all magecraft, the one that is said to grant its holder's wishes? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Yes, that's the one. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Mages in Fuyuki City competed for the Grail, and in order to activate it summoned seven Heroic Spirits&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
That was the beginning of the Holy Grail War. Unknown to anyone, Servants were summoned to this town. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The Fuyuki Holy Grail War system is simple. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Seven Masters fight each other. 
The last one standing gets the Grail. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea learned about this in 2010. My father...
I mean, the previous director used this data to build the summoning system. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's what makes up Chaldea's Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate. Our third invention after Laplace and Chaldeas. 
 
**Mash:**
Third? Isn't that the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That was created by Professor Lev. 
Well, I guess you can say we both worked on it. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Anyway, this is where Servants come from. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Seven Servants fought here, and in the end, Saber was victorious. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The town wasn't destroyed, and the Servants shouldn't have been noticed by anyone, but...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Now this is happening. We should assume that the outcome changed due to this Singularity. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The anomaly in 2004 brought about an alteration to human history and as a result, we're no longer able to see 100 years into the future. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's why it's our job to repair this anomaly. 
Somewhere here is the reason history has been disturbed. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Once we analyze and eliminate it, that will complete our mission. All of us will be able to return to the present. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. Got it. 
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, although we're not sure what's going on, it's good that the mission is simple. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Heroic Spirits were summoned at Chaldea? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Of course. 
But it didn't go well, and there weren't many successes. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
According to the data, three were summoned, but I only know of two. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The previous director summoned the first. 
The second and third arrived after I became Director. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...The second fused with Mash. 
And, well, you know the third. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The weirdo that now lives in Chaldea. 
Leonardo da Vinci. 
 
---
 
**???:**
GuOOOOOOO!!!!!! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Not these guys again! 
Get rid of them, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Phew, the battle is over Master. 
I'm relieved that we pulled through again. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work, Mash. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you, Mash. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. 
I am happy that I can be useful. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Hey, Mash. 
Is it possible that you can't use your Noble Phantasm? 
 
**Mash:**
Apparently. I don't even know which Heroic Spirit fused with me...
 
**Mash:**
...and I'm unable to use the power of its Special Arts,
the Heroic Spirit's secret weapon&mdash;known as a Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mash:**
Fujimaru Senpai. 
I'm sorry for explaining this so late. 
 
**Mash:**
Servants are equipped with a unique skill called a Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mash:**
It's derived from each hero's legend and great deeds, and is a secret weapon. 
 
**Mash:**
However, I am unable to wield my Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mash:**
...I can somehow use it as a weapon, but its output is decreased. I can't even release its True Name. 
 
**Mash:**
In fact, I don't even know what the origins of this weapon of mine might be. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...
 
**Mash:**
In any case, you can think of me as a failed Servant. 
Or maybe just a capable kouhai that can get even stronger. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't have any leads on the Heroic Spirit that fused with me, but with you as my Master I will figure it out as I grow. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's true. Masters have the ability to analyze their Servants parameters, skills, and matrixes. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Fujimaru...As a Master, once you become good enough, you should be able to analyze Mash's Servant data. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Any Servants you make a contract with from this point should be the same. First, you need to learn their True Name and Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
As your trust with them grows, your Servant's power will grow too. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Well, it's not like you have that much potential in you. 
The fact that you can't use Mash that well shows that. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Once we get Chaldea's Rayshift capability back online, we're going to shift a first-class Master here. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Then you're fired. Newbies with no combat experience can spend their time terrified in some corner in Chaldea. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Weren't you the one scared, Director Marie? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I wasn't! Not in the least! 
You should be respectful to your elders! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could it be that you're worried about me? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
O-Of course! You're our only fighting force here! 
If you get taken out, who's going to fight? 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...Anyway, I'm glad you two understand each other better now. Let's move before any more of them show up. 
 
## Section 5: Investigate the Church Ruin
 
**Olga Marie:**
Everything's burnt down far as the eye can see...
There aren't any traces of residents either. What happened here? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What could even turn Chaldea gray in the first place? 
If we can't see the future, that means humanity will vanish...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Could that mean the Counter Force doesn't work in a Singularity? Then this place is like a Bolt...
 
**Olga Marie:**
The fatal choice of destruction scattered throughout human history...When your choices become mistakes, this is what happens. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like the Director is talking to herself again. 
This could take a while. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey Fujimaru, looks like it's safe over there. Why don't you rest a bit? 
 
**Mash:**
I agree with you, Doctor. 
Senpai, would you like some rations? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks. Aren't you tired, Mash? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure, but how are you, Mash? 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Tired? Are you asking if I've been having any problems since I became a Servant? 
 
**Mash:**
...Well, for the most part. 
It's scary to fight, but I'm doing fine otherwise. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you okay with me being your Master? 
 
**Mash:**
Of course. 
I think you might've been the best Master this summer. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Any complaints since you've become a Servant? 
 
**Mash:**
It's hard to explain. 
Imagine yourself becoming a jet fighter. 
 
**Mash:**
You might be able to fly around in the sky, but you can't do your own maintenance. 
 
**Mash:**
No matter how strong you might be, your existence essentially depends on having a Master. 
 
**Mash:**
...The risk and reward makes sense here. But I can't be too happy when I think of the burden I'm putting on you. 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;! That's enough rest! 
We got incoming! 
 
**Mash:**
...Master, your commands, please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Phew! 
Thank goodness, we managed it yet again Master. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I see you're getting used to being a Servant. 
Is it because now that you know what we're up against, you're not afraid anymore? 
 
**Mash:**
I don't know about that. No matter how good I am with my weapon, when it comes to the battle itself...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, let's talk later! 
The three of you need to get out of there now! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm still picking up something! 
And this is&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
Wha&mdash;is that...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Servant is there! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't fight it, Fujimaru, Mash! 
It's too soon for you to fight a Servant! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Even so, we can't escape! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Mash, prepare for battle! 
It's a Servant, you can do something about it, right? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. 
I will do my best! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Okay&mdash;okay&mdash;we won...I was sure I didn't stand a chance, but we actually won&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Sorry, there's no time to rest Mash. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"A similar signal as before" is heading that way. 
I don't have to tell you what you need to do, right? 
 
**Mash:**
What&mdash;Same signal? 
No way&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
Fujimaru! Retreat! Hurry up! 
We've got to get out of here now! 
 
## Section 6: Shadow Servant
 
**Olga Marie:**
Okay&mdash;Oh for God's sake, what is happening? 
Why are Servants here? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see...A Holy Grail War? 
A Holy Grail War was going on in that town! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Normally, it would be a battle royale amongst the Seven Servants summoned in Fuyuki. But something's gone terribly wrong. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not surprised there's a Servant without a Master. 
It's natural for Servants to target other Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
Then as long as I'm here, we'll be targeted by other Servants? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
But Mash has nothing to do with the Grail! 
That's just a wandering phantom gone mad! 
 
**F：Servant:**
&mdash;I found it. 
New prey. The Grail shall be mine! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servant's signal confirmed, it's an Assassin-class Servant! 
 
**Mash:**
I can fight! 
Senpai, please give me your orders! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right, I'll have us win no matter what! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, just bear with us a little longer! 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Okay. 
I'll bring you victory, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
All right&mdash;How about that! 
 
**F：Servant:**
&mdash;This is a waste of time. 
I could have handled this on my own. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...What does that mean? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Mash, fall back! 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, they've caught up! 
There's one more, that's their main force! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No way...We're losing to one already, and now there's one more on the way? 
 
**Mash:**
Ah&mdash;
 
**F：Servant:**
Let's finish this, Lancer. I don't know what kind of Heroic Spirit that is, but I will have her head. 
 
**G：Servant:**
&mdash;Ha. Hahahahahahahahahaha! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Director, Mash, hang in there! 
You got to keep moving! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou! 
 
**G：Servant:**
&mdash;Ha. Hahahahahahahahahaha! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Dammit, they both let fear get to them...Give your orders, Fujimaru! You're the only calm one now! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We've got to run for now! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! 
 
**G：Servant:**
Fun, fun, fun, fun! 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh...
 
**G：Servant:**
This is fun! I want to kill! Yes, run! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We have no choice but to fight! 
 
**Mash:**
...Understood, there's no other option! 
 
**F：Servant:**
Ha! Futile! Fight, then you die. Run, and you still die. 
The demise of the futile, oh so miserable. 
 
**G：Servant:**
Go ahead and struggle. 
Miserable people are ever so entertaining. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
F-Fight? Are you serious? We don't stand a chance against something like that, right!? 
 
**Mash:**
...Even so, we must fight. 
I will find a way for us to get out of this alive! 
 
**F：Servant:**
Ha&mdash; You've just killed yourself, girl! 
 
**???:**
I thought you were just some girl, but it looks like you've got some fight in you. Then I can't leave you like this. 
 
---
 
**F：Servant:**
Ugh! Who are you? 
 
**???:**
What do you mean? Can't you tell? 
Don't tell me the mud got in your eyes too? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**G：Servant:**
Curse you Caster! 
Why are you siding with a Wanderer? 
 
**Caster:**
Huh? Because it's better than siding with you guys. 
And hey, I don't mind brats with some potential. 
 
**Caster:**
Young lady, be ready for a fight. Don't worry, you're good. You can turn this around if you just pay attention. 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right, I'll do my best! 
 
**Caster:**
Hey {(M) Boy /(F) Lady}, are you her Master? 
Then I'm leaving the orders to you. 
 
**Caster:**
I'm a Caster-class Servant. 
They don't really like me right now. 
 
**Caster:**
Not like the enemy of my enemy is my friend, but for now you can trust me. 
 
**Caster:**
In honor of the brave young lady there, I'll form a temporary contract with you and fight as your Servant! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**F：Servant:**
Ugh&mdash; Curse you, with the Holy Grail,
before my eyes&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Um, excuse me...
Thank you very much, for saving us from danger...
 
**Caster:**
Hey, good work. 
You don't owe me for this, so don't worry about it. 
 
**Caster:**
You should be more worried about your body. 
That damn Assassin kept targeting your butt like a pest! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh! 
 
**Caster:**
Hey, you look fragile but you have a pretty nice body! 
Icing on the cake! 
 
**Caster:**
I have no idea what class you are, but you're pretty sturdy...Maybe Saber? No, you don't have a sword. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Hey Fujimaru, what did you think of that? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Without a doubt, he's an old pervert. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...He's an ally, maybe? 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For now, let's get some information. 
He seems to be a decent Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Caster:**
Oh, so someone who wants to cut to the chase. 
What is this? Some means of communication through magecraft? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well met, Caster Servant. I don't know which Heroic Spirit you are, but we have nothing but respect and awe for you. 
 
**Caster:**
Oh, spare me your remarks. I'm sick of hearing them. 
State your business, weakling. Isn't that what you're good at? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh...I-I see. All right then...Weakling...I got called a weakling from someone I've met for the first time. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...And that's the current situation in Chaldea. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Currently, Fujimaru is the acting Master and in the middle of conducting field research. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let me confirm something. You're a Servant from the Holy Grail War that broke out in this city, and the sole survivor? 
 
**Caster:**
If by that you mean I haven't lost. Our Holy Grail War changed to something else entirely along the way. 
 
**Caster:**
I don't know how it happened either. The city was engulfed in flames, and the humans vanished. 
Only the Servants remained. 
 
**Caster:**
Saber was the first to resume the Holy Grail War. That chap began rampaging like a tiger released from a cage. 
 
**Caster:**
Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker,
and Assassin were all defeated by Saber. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
The survival of the Seven Servants...
That rule of the Holy Grail War was broken here. 
 
**Mash:**
And in the end you won, Caster...
Or rather, you're the Servant who survived. 
 
**Caster:**
Yes. Any Servant that was defeated by Saber became like those two, corrupted by the black mud. 
 
**Caster:**
They, and the monsters that sprung up like maggots, started looking for something together. 
 
**Caster:**
The troublesome part is that I'm one of the things they're looking for. You see, the Holy Grail War won't end until I'm killed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You and Saber are the only surviving Servants...
Then if you defeat Saber...
 
**Caster:**
Yes, that would probably end the Holy Grail War here. 
But I don't know whether things would return to normal. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I see. You helped us, but in the end,
it was for your own sake, huh? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You want to defeat Saber, but don't stand a chance doing it alone. That's why you zeroed in on us...Right? 
 
**Caster:**
That's right. But it's not a bad deal, is it? 
At any rate&mdash;It looks like we've got company. 
 
**???:**
GuOOOOOOOOO! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Yikes! 
 
**Caster:**
There's no end to these guys. 
I'm telling you, there's nothing better than having allies! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Sigh...Things have settled down at last. 
True, we can't have a decent conversation like this. 
 
**Caster:**
My bad. If I'd been summoned as a Lancer,
I could've finished off Saber with just one strike. 
 
**Caster:**
Man, Caster is just not for me. 
I don't like being a Caster in a Holy Grail War like this. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you were a Lancer? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it hard being a Caster? 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
It's been known to happen, Senpai. Some Heroic Spirits have the attributes of multiple classes. 
 
**Mash:**
He is not just a spear-wielder, but a high-level Heroic Spirit with qualifications to be a mage. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm only speculating, but he must be one of the top Servants. The kind that's featured in the magazine Vivian. 
 
**Caster:**
Ahh yes, you said you were Masters of an organization called Chaldea...I guess that's all I need to know. 
 
**Caster:**
In general, Servants tend not to get overly involved in problems outside of their own time period. 
We ultimately only cooperate as weapons. 
 
**Caster:**
Your goal is to investigate this anomaly. 
My goal is to put an end to the Holy Grail War. 
 
**Caster:**
We share mutual interests. 
So how about we join forces? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...That is a rational proposition. 
But if we do that, who will be your Master? 
 
**Caster:**
Well that {(M) kid /(F) young lady} there, of course. It doesn't seem like you have the aptitude to be a Master. 
 
**Caster:**
I mean you possess high quality magical circuits, yet you don't have the aptitude to be a Master. Is it a curse? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Oh, shut up! 
What do you care? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Fujimaru, he's in your hands. 
Use him wisely. 
 
**Caster:**
Then it's settled. 
The contract is only temporary, but I'm counting on ya. 
 
**Caster:**
That leaves one last thing, your goal. 
What you're looking for is probably the Greater Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Greater Grail? 
I'm not familiar with that. What is it? 
 
**Caster:**
This land's true "heart. "
If there is indeed a "Singularity," it has to be that. 
 
**Caster:**
But Saber is lingering around the Greater Grail. 
The remaining Servants she contaminated, too. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Berserker and Archer are the ones left? 
What are those two like? Are they strong? 
 
**Caster:**
Well, Archer can be dealt with if I'm with you. 
Berserker is the problem. 
 
**Caster:**
Even Saber had trouble with that monster. 
But he won't attack unless you get close to him, so ignoring him is one option. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We understand the situation now. We'll team up with Mr. Caster to obtain the Greater Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mr. Caster, would you show us the way? 
 
**Caster:**
Skip the "Mister. " I'll take you there. 
The {(M) kid /(F) young lady} here will decide when to make our move. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Much obliged. Then shall we resume the search? 
I'm counting on you, Fujimaru. 
 
## Section 7: Toward the Greater Grail
**--BATTLE--**
## Section 8: Mash's Training
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Hey, Fujimaru. 
It's pretty obvious that Kyrielight's looking depressed. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You are her Master, aren't you? 
Do something to cheer her up! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, is something wrong? 
 
**Mash:**
No! There's nothing different. 
I'm operating perfectly, Master! 
 
**Mash:**
But that's the problem, nothing's different...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could it be...
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I'm ashamed to be the one to say this, but...
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Um, under your command Senpai, I have gained enough experience...
 
**Mash:**
And yet...I'm still unable to unleash my Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't even know how to unleash it...
I'm like a defective Servant. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, so that's what was bothering you. 
You have such a strong sense of responsibility, Mash...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I don't think that can be settled overnight. 
After all, it's a Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If a Heroic Spirit's secret weapon can be mastered within a day or two, then Servants wouldn't be that special anymore. 
 
**Caster:**
Of course we can master something like that immediately. After all, Heroic Spirits and Noble Phantasms are the same thing. 
 
**Caster:**
If the young lady here can fight as a Servant, that means at that very moment you can use your Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Caster:**
And yet you can't, which simply means your magical energy is not circulating right. 
 
**Caster:**
Let's see, maybe enthusiasm? No, perhaps too reserved? 
Anyway, I'm sure it's because you just don't yell out when you practice. 
 
**Mash:**
Really? R-E-A-L-L-Y-!? 
 
**Fou:**
Faaaaaaaaaaa? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Hey, don't yell all of a sudden! 
You're going to burst my eardrums, seriously! 
 
**Mash:**
Sorry Director. 
But Caster said we should shout...
 
**Caster:**
No, that was a metaphor...
Well, at any rate, I see you have enthusiasm. 
 
**Caster:**
Fujimaru, you heard the young lady. 
Do you mind if we take a quick detour? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Detour? What kind? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't tease Mash. She's an innocent girl. 
 
---
 
**Caster:**
What? I'm just talking about special training. It won't take long. I'm a Caster right now, so leave the healing to me. 
 
**Caster:**
First we'll start off small. Let me inscribe some misfortune-bringing runes...Okay, we're done. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Huh? What are you doing? 
Why are you inscribing runes on my coat? 
 
**Caster:**
Even if something targets you, you can take care of yourself, right? And look, here they come. 
 
**???:**
Grrrrrr...
Zuaaaaaaaa! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I don't know what you're talking about! 
 
**Mash:**
D-Director, get behind me! 
You too Senpai, prepare for battle! 
 
**Caster:**
All right, that should be enough. 
 
**Caster:**
To put it simply, a Noble Phantasm is part of a Heroic Spirit's instinct. It's hard to use it if you think too much. 
 
**Caster:**
Therefore, you must first use up all of your energy, young lady! Man, I'm a genius! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That isn't a cure, that's an extreme measure! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe you're an idiot? 
 
---
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
I can't, go on&mdash; Any more back-to-back, battles&mdash;
I'm sorry, Caster&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Rather than test my will, please teach me some solid theories&mdash;
 
**Caster:**
&mdash;You just don't get it, do you? 
Did I miscalculate? 
 
**Caster:**
Oh well, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. 
Okay, I'm your next opponent. 
 
**Caster:**
You don't have to hold back because we're allies. 
I'm not gonna hold back when I kill Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
Wh-! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What are you talking about? Are you crazy? 
What does Fujimaru have to do with this? 
 
**Caster:**
A Servant's problems are the Master's problems. 
Didn't I mention that you share the same fate? 
 
**Caster:**
You've had the same thought, right Fujimaru? When the young lady can't stand anymore, it's your death. 
 
**Mash:**
...Master, please, stand back! 
 
**Mash:**
I&mdash;won't be a hindrance for Senpai...
I won't! 
 
**Caster:**
That's what I like to hear. 
All right, let's have a real Servant battle. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
(Pant)&mdash;(Pant)&mdash;(Pant)&mdash;
 
**Caster:**
Ok, it's time to finish this. 
Burn to the ground with your Master! 
 
**Caster:**
My spell is the coffin of flames, a giant of verdant thorn. 
Retribution, the forest that will purify human misery&mdash;
 
**Caster:**
Befall the Wicker Man! 
And behold, as both good and evil bite the dust&mdash;! 
 
**Mash:**
Ah&mdash;Ah...
 
**Mash:**
(I must protect...I must unleash it, or everyone will&mdash;
Even if it's fake, even if it's just for now...
 
**Mash:**
...I have to unleash it properly, or everyone will disappear&mdash;! )
 
**Mash:**
Ahhhhhhhh&mdash;! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Oh...I...
Did I, manage to unleash my Noble...Phantasm...
 
**Caster:**
&mdash;Whew, I knew you'd survive that. But I never thought both you and your Master would walk out without a scratch. 
 
**Caster:**
Be happy, wait no...
Praise her, Fujimaru. 
 
**Caster:**
That young lady there is without question, a first-rate Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I...just now! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right. Congratulations, Mash. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah. That was amazing, Mash. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
!! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooooouuuu! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That was surprising. I didn't expect her to unleash her Noble Phantasm that soon. Mash was never someone with a strong will...
 
**Caster:**
That's because you got her all wrong. 
You may call the young lady here, a protector. 
 
**Caster:**
There's no point in teaching a bird to swim, is there? 
You have to teach a bird how to fly high. 
 
**Caster:**
Although...
She didn't get to obtain its True Name. 
 
**Mash:**
Right. Even though I can unleash my Noble Phantasm now, I still don't know its True Name, nor the True Name of the Heroic Spirit...
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's fine, even if you are inexperienced...
Even if you are only temporary...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Your very wish unleashed your Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
You didn't have the slightest desire to obtain a True Name, to become one of the chosen&mdash;
To become a true Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's why your Noble Phantasm responded. 
Ahhh, what an inspiring story. Just like a fairy tale. 
 
**Mash:**
Um, Director...
 
**Olga Marie:**
Don't mind me, I'm just teasing. I'm pleased that you're able to use your Noble Phantasm now. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
But it's inconvenient to use it without a True Name, right? I'll think of a good spell for you. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Since it's a pseudo-deployment of Noble Phantasm...
Let me see...Yes, let's call it "Lord Chaldeas. "
 
**Olga Marie:**
Chaldea is a name that has meaning for you too. So to activate your Spirit Origin, that's a good spell for you, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes...
Thank you, Director! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Lord Chaldeas...Yes, I like it. 
That fits you perfectly, Mash! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And the desire to try it out after getting it is only human nature. Caster, would you be Mash's sparring partner? 
 
**Caster:**
Yes, of course. I was holding back before, but even so, her defense was impeccable. 
 
**Caster:**
As someone with more experience, I'll hammer the basics of Noble Phantasms into your head. 
Fujimaru, young lady, are you ready? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, please! 
 
## Section 9: The Dark Cave
 
**Caster:**
The Greater Grail is back here. 
It's a little far back, so don't get lost. 
 
**Mash:**
This place looks like a natural cave...
Did this always exist in Fuyuki City? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Probably, it's half natural, half man-made. It's the underground workshop expanded by mages over a number of years. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Anyway, Caster. 
I forgot to ask you something important. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Do you know Saber's True Name? 
It sounded like you'd fought several times. 
 
**Caster:**
Yes, I know it. Anyone who gets hit by Saber's Noble Phantasm will find out that bastard's True Name...
 
**Caster:**
The other Servants were all defeated because Saber's Noble Phantasm was that powerful. 
 
**Mash:**
A powerful Noble Phantasm, is it? 
What was it like? 
 
**Caster:**
The sister sword of the Sword in the Stone. 
It's the most famous sacred sword in your time period. 
 
**Caster:**
Its name...
 
**Servant:**
The Sword of Promised Victory, Excalibur. 
Wielded by King Arthur, the proud King of Knights. 
 
**Fujimaru:**
!? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Archer! 
 
**Caster:**
Ah, speak of the devil. Or shall I say, the faithful follower. 
As always, I see that you're still the loyal knight. 
 
**Archer:**
...Hmph, I don't remember becoming a follower of anybody. I'm just here to chase away unwanted visitors. 
 
**Caster:**
In other words, you're the gatekeeper. I don't know why you're protecting Saber, but let's end this here. 
 
**Caster:**
Isn't a game that never ends boring? For better or worse,
we need to move the pieces forward. 
 
**Archer:**
From the way you talk, I think you understand the circumstances. Yet you are still absorbed by your own desires...
 
**Archer:**
You still haven't changed despite being a mage now. 
In that case, I will knock some sense into you. 
 
**Caster:**
Ha, big talk for a mere Archer. 
Hey, why are you just standing there, young lady? 
 
**Caster:**
He's an Archer. Without your shield,
I won't have the time to cast my spells. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah...R-Right! 
Sorry, I was out of it for a second there. 
 
**Mash:**
But no problem, I can do this. 
When it comes to guarding, leave it to me! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Archer:**
Well done, Mage of Flowers! Who knew her Noble Phantasm could be utilized that way! 
 
**Caster:**
Hey, it's time for you to take a hike! 
The young lady and I will take down the Sacred Sword! 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm glad that you trust me, but do you think I can guard against it? 
 
**Mash:**
...I've heard about the Sword of King Arthur. 
My fingers are trembling, it seems too much for me...
 
**Caster:**
Well, you'll just have to overcome it with courage. But from where I stand, you seem to be perfect for the job. 
 
**Caster:**
That shield will never shatter, if you were to lose, it would be because the young lady messed it up. 
 
**Caster:**
If you let go of that shield, your Master behind it will evaporate instantly. 
 
**Caster:**
Listen, don't think about beating the Sword. 
All you need to think about is protecting your Master. 
 
**Caster:**
That's right up your alley, no? 
 
**Caster:**
Well, anyway. Leave it to me to finish off Saber,
and just do what you need to do. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. That advice will be of great help. 
 
## Section 10: Facing the Greater Grail
 
**Caster:**
Time for the Greater Grail. This will be our last break. 
Is there anything you've left undone? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, I'm ready. 
 
**Caster:**
That's good to hear. I dislike Masters who can't make up their minds when push comes to shove. 
 
**Caster:**
You're still a rookie, but you've got the most important thing a pioneer can have. 
 
**Caster:**
The divine luck to grasp fate, and the ability to make decisions. 
 
**Caster:**
Don't forget how to be reckless. People like that are the ones who'll get blessed by the stars. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can we go back to the base first? 
 
**Caster:**
If it's necessary, then by all means go back. 
We're attacking a bear in its hole, so we need plenty of supplies. 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
I don't know what you're talking about. Whether we forge ahead or go back, we need to rest first. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Doctor, are you checking vitals? 
Fujimaru looks paler than usual. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Ah...Yeah, this doesn't look very good. 
It's because of the unexpected Servant contract...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You never used your magic circuits and now they're running at full capacity. It's probably putting stress on your brain. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, set up camp. 
It's time to make warm tea with plenty of honey. 
 
**Mash:**
Got it, Doctor. 
I think tea time is a good idea. 
 
**Caster:**
Oh, feeding yourselves before the final battle? 
Then maybe I'll go hunting for some wild boars. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm sure there aren't any around here. Besides, forget about meat, if you must get something make it fruit. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm stuffed. I can't believe you had dried fruits with you, Director. Again, your level of preparation astonishes me. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I just happened to have them. Citrus is effective against headaches. But that aside&mdash;
 
**Olga Marie:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, what is it, Director? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Would you like seconds, Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No, I'm full! But from now on, remember that I like coffee more than tea! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
N-No, that's not it. 
That's not what I wanted to...Oh, forget it! 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
Th-The work you've done so far, has been passable. 
As the director of Chaldea, I have to give you credit. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
...Hmph. What's that look for? 
I'm sure it's a fluke, but right now you're all we've got. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What I'm saying is, keep it up and you might hear praise from me yet. I know that even a third-rater can do first-rate work. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, well, admitting that Fujimaru did a solid job. Have you eaten something sweet? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Romani. If you've got time to be flapping your gums,
use it to send Fujimaru a supply or two instead. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I would feel bad if someone failed because they were ill-equipped. Especially, when they have been doing their best. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's this? "Feel bad? " How kind of you. Director,
does this mean you're finally opening up your heart? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Idio...I-I meant pitiful! Pathetic! 
You couldn't even tell that? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I never grow tired of watching young men and women interact. Although when it comes to young women, Director, you're not really...
 
**Mash:**
Is that right? Certainly, the Director is older, but I feel like we have similar tastes. I feel affection for her. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
What are you going on about? 
I told you before that you're all just tools to me! 
 
**???:**
&mdash;(Mm, hmm)
 
**Olga Marie:**
There, see? 
Even this shadowy-like monster-thing agrees with me! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Huh? &mdash;Eeeeek! Mash, hurry up and get rid of it! 
It's gonna eat me! It's gonna eat me! 
 
## Section 11: Grand Order
 
**Olga Marie:**
This is the Greater Grail...It's an ultra-superior Magical Reactor...What's it doing on this island nation in the Far East? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
According to our data, it was built by an eminent family of alchemists called the Einzberns. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Though apparently they didn't belong to the Mage's Association, and were solely made of homunculi. 
 
**Caster:**
Sorry, that's it for the chitchat. 
The lady has noticed us. 
 
**Saber:**
&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...Unbelievable magical output...
Is that really King Arthur? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No question. She seems to have changed somehow but she's the king of Britain, Arthur, wielder of the Sacred Sword. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Her gender's different than the legend, but she had her reasons for dressing like a man in Camelot. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I mean, you can't assume the throne unless you're a man, right? She must've had to pretend to be a guy for family reasons. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I have an idea who's behind that. It's mentioned in the legends, but Merlin really does have a terrible taste. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Ah, you're right. 
I thought that person was a man, but it's a woman. 
 
**Caster:**
Don't be fooled by her appearance. She's a monster. 
Her power is not of muscle, but a ridiculous amount of magical energy. 
 
**Caster:**
Every single strike is massive. If you're not paying attention, the top half of your body will go flying. 
 
**Mash:**
Basically, just think of her like a human rocket. 
...Understood, I'll fight back with everything I've got. 
 
**Caster:**
Good. If you defeat her, the anomaly in this town will disappear. Listen, that includes both me and her. 
 
**Caster:**
After that, it's your job. 
I don't know what will happen, but do the best you can. 
 
**Saber:**
&mdash;I see. 
You've got an interesting Servant with you. 
 
**Caster:**
What! You can talk? 
You were just maintaining your silence all this time? 
 
**Saber:**
Yes, and you were being watched the whole time you were chatting. I merely acted as a scarecrow. 
 
**Saber:**
But&mdash;it's interesting. 
I'm curious about that Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Saber:**
Be ready, strange girl. 
This sword shall test the truth of your shield. 
 
**Mash:**
Here she comes&mdash;Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, let's fight together! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, no way are we gonna lose this! 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Yes! Mash Kyrielight, here I come! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Saber:**
&mdash;Hmph. Unbeknownst to me, my power has weakened. I stayed my hand at the very last moment. 
 
**Saber:**
I was going to defend the Holy Grail to the end, but I lost because my tenacity wavered. 
 
**Saber:**
Ultimately, no matter how my fate changes, I will always meet the same end if I'm alone. 
 
**Caster:**
What's that supposed to mean? 
Bastard, what do you know? 
 
**Saber:**
Eventually, you too will realize it, Ireland's Child of Light. 
 
**Saber:**
Grand Order&mdash;the battle to obtain the Holy Grail has only just begun. 
 
**Caster:**
Hey, wait! What do you mean by&mdash; Whoa! 
Oh crap, I am getting sent back too? 
 
**Caster:**
Dammit! I don't like this, but whatever. 
{(M) Kid /(F) Young Lady}, I'm leaving the rest to you! 
 
**Caster:**
If there's a next time, try to summon me as a Lancer! 
 
**Mash:**
Confirming both Saber and Caster have vanished. 
...Does that mean we've won? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, you did a fine job, Mash, Fujimaru! The Director must be so pleased...Hey, where's the Director? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Grand Order...
How did that Servant know that name? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Orders please, Director Marie. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Is something the matter? 
 
---
 
**Olga Marie:**
Huh? O-Oh, right. 
Well done Fujimaru, Mash. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Several points are unclear, but let's call this mission complete. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
First, let's retrieve that crystal. 
It's the reason Saber became abnormal...
 
**Olga Marie:**
It's clearly the reason why Fuyuki City became a singularity. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. An immediate retrieval&mdash;What? 
 
**???:**
Well, I didn't expect you'd get this far. 
Beyond my plan's expectations and my own tolerances. 
 
**???:**
Master Candidate #48. It was my mistake to naively overlook you as an improbable child. 
 
**Mash:**
Professor Lev? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Lev&mdash;! 
Professor Lev, you say? He's there? 
 
**Lev:**
Hm, is that Romani I hear? 
So, you survived as well. 
 
**Lev:**
I told you to come to the command room immediately, but it seems you didn't listen. Honestly&mdash;
 
**Lev:**
Trash who can't even follow orders. 
Just the mere sight of it makes me want to throw up. 
 
**Lev:**
Why is it that humans always try to avoid their preordained destinies? 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;! 
Master, fall back! Fall back, please! 
 
**Mash:**
That person is dangerous...Th...
That isn't the Professor Lev we know! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Lev...Oh, Lev! Lev! You're alive! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Thank goodness! Without you, I don't know how I could protect Chaldea! 
 
**Mash:**
Director don't! That man is...
 
**Lev:**
Hi, Olga. You seem well. 
Looks like you had a rough time, too. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Yes, yes, that's right, Lev! The command room blew up,
the city's in ruins, and I can't return to Chaldea! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm going crazy from all these unforeseen complications! 
But it's okay, as long as you're here we'll be fine, right? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
That's how it's always been, right? 
You'll help me this time too, won't you? 
 
**Lev:**
Yes, of course. 
Honestly, all these complications have irritated me. 
 
**Lev:**
And the biggest complication is you, Olga. 
I set the bomb right under your feet, yet you still live. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
&mdash;What? 
...L-Lev? Um, wh-what's that supposed to mean? 
 
**Lev:**
Sorry, you're not actually alive. 
You're already dead. Your body, at least, long ago. 
 
**Lev:**
Trismegistus thoughtfully transferred you into this land after you'd become residual thoughts. 
 
**Lev:**
You had no aptitude for Rayshift while alive, right? 
You can't teleport while you have a physical body. 
 
**Lev:**
Understand? You only gained the aptitude you so desired after you died. 
 
**Lev:**
That's why you can't return to Chaldea. 
The moment you do, your consciousness will vanish. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Wh-What? I'll vanish? 
Wait...I can't return to Chaldea? 
 
**Lev:**
Indeed. But that's too sad of a story for you. 
 
**Lev:**
Let me show you the fate of the Chaldea that you devoted your entire life to. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Wh-What is that? 
Chaldeas is bright red? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
It's a lie, right? It's just an illusion, right, Lev? 
 
**Lev:**
It's real. I've connected the dimensions for you. 
Having the Holy Grail allows me to do so. 
 
**Lev:**
Now behold, descendant of Animusphere. 
Behold your folly! 
 
**Lev:**
Not a sliver of blue representing human survival remains. 
Nothing but a burning, bright, red. 
 
**Lev:**
That is the outcome of this mission. 
 
**Lev:**
Isn't it wonderful, Marie? Once again, your incompetence has brought forth tragedy! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Don't&mdash;Don't be absurd! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
I'm not responsible! 
I didn't fail! I'm not dead! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Who are you? 
What have you done to my Chaldeas! 
 
**Lev:**
It isn't "yours. " Honestly&mdash;
What an annoying girl you are! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Wha...Something's pulling&mdash;
my body across space&mdash;
 
**Lev:**
I told you. That place is now connected with Chaldea. 
 
**Lev:**
I could kill you now, but there's no grace to that. 
I will grant you your final wish, instead. 
 
**Lev:**
Go ahead and lay hands on your treasure. 
Think of it as benevolence on my part. 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Wait&mdash;What do you mean, Lev? 
My treasure...You mean Chaldeas? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No, stop, please! Chaldeas? A high-density body of data? A territory of dimensional anomaly? 
 
**Lev:**
Yes. No different from a black hole. 
Or perhaps a sun. Well, either way. 
 
**Lev:**
A human touching it would be a hellish disintegration on the molecular level. By all means, have a taste of infinite living death! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No&mdash;No, no! Someone help me! Help! 
I...I don't want to die here! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Because I've never been praised...
I've never been praised by anyone! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
Why? Why does this always happen to me!? 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No one ever valued me! 
Everyone hated me! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
No! Stop! No, no, no, no, no...
I haven't even accomplished anything yet! 
 
**Olga Marie:**
From the moment I was born,
I've never been accepted by anyone&mdash;! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Director! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It's too late, we can't make it...
 
---
 
**Fujimaru:**
!!! 
 
**Mash:**
No! Don't do it, Senpai! 
If you approach that man, you'll die the same way! 
 
**Lev:**
Oh? Impressive, for a Demi-Servant. 
You sense that I am a fundamentally different life form. 
 
**Lev:**
Shall I reintroduce myself? 
My name is Lev Lainur Flauros...
 
**Lev:**
...In charge of the year 2017 sent to dispose of you humans. 
 
**Lev:**
Are you listening, Dr. Romani? As a friend who studied magecraft with you, let me give you some final advice. 
 
**Lev:**
Chaldea is finished. You humans have reached the moment of your destruction. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Professor Lev. 
No. Lev Lainur. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What do you mean? 
Is it related to being unable to see 2019? 
 
**Lev:**
It's not "related. "
It's the reality that this is the end. 
 
**Lev:**
Unable to observe the future, you babbled that it had "disappeared. " That was truly wishful thinking. 
 
**Lev:**
The future didn't disappear. It was incinerated. 
The moment Chaldeas was dyed crimson. 
 
**Lev:**
Your end is certain. 
Your era no longer exists. 
 
**Lev:**
Chaldeas' magnetic field may be protecting Chaldea,
but any outside of it will face the same fate as Fuyuki City. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...So, that was it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We didn't lose contact with the outside world due to interference, we simply lost the outside world itself. 
 
**Lev:**
Hmpf, you really are perceptive. 
A shame I didn't kill you immediately. 
 
**Lev:**
But that too is futile resistance. If the time within Chaldea passes 2018 it will be wiped from this universe. 
 
**Lev:**
No one can change the outcome now. 
This is a rejection of humanity by human history. 
 
**Lev:**
You didn't perish because your inability to evolve, nor did you perish due to war with foreign species. 
 
**Lev:**
Rather, it was your own foolishness! Your incompetence! 
Because you lost the grace of our King! 
 
**Lev:**
Like a bunch of worthless scrap paper, you'll be burned away without a trace! 
 
**Lev:**
Ah, is this singularity at its limit? 
 
**Lev:**
...Cursed Saber. If you'd just obeyed, you would have been allowed to live. 
 
**Lev:**
Even when given the Holy Grail, she caused trouble by wanting to sustain this era. 
 
**Lev:**
Farewell, Romani. 
And you Mash, Candidate #48. 
 
**Lev:**
Believe it or not, I have other things to do. 
My enjoyment of your destruction ends here. 
 
**Lev:**
Now, be swallowed by the dimensional warp. But I'm not that evil, I'll allow you to say a final prayer. 
 
**Mash:**
The underground cavern's collapsing! 
No, the cavern wasn't stable in the first place! 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor! 
Perform an emergency Rayshift! 
 
**Mash:**
At any rate, we can at least save Senpai! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Understood! I'm already doing it! 
But I'm sorry, it may collapse faster than I can fix it! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If it does, then do what you can on your side! I mean,
we can survive in space for a few dozen seconds, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Sorry, but please shut up, Doctor! 
I'm so mad, I'm about to lose my cool! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just hang on to your consciousness! 
If we don't lose that, I might salvage&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
We won't make it! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, this way! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, you at least...
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, your hand! 
 
**???:**
All right, you're a good boy. 
Want something to eat? Nuts? Or maybe fish? 
 
**???:**
Hm, not sure if you are a cat or a squirrel. 
But that's okay, you are pretty cute! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
Kyu, kyu...
 
**???:**
Hm? Ah, the hero has awakened. 
There, there, that's how a main character should be. 
 
**???:**
Good morning Fujimaru. 
You're conscious now? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who are you? 
 
---
 
**???:**
Hm, you're not thinking straight yet? 
This is the first time we've spoken directly like this. 
 
**???:**
What? Are you shocked that you woke up to the sight of such a beauty? I understand, but I'm used to it. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm Da Vinci, a Chaldea collaborator. 
Or perhaps the third summoned Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, we'll talk later. 
Somebody's waiting for you, go to the command room. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Someone's waiting? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it the doctor? 
 
---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Roman? 
Roman's waiting too, but he's not important. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Jeez, there's someone else, she's the important one. 
Guess you're not used to being the main character yet. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
See? This little one says so, too. 
Come on, time to get up Fujimaru. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
From here on, you'll be the center of this story. 
The choices you make will probably save us all. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Just like the multitudes of brave souls who weren't remembered by history as they saved humanity. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You've been given a role to fight, not as a hero, but as a human walking a path that was preordained by the stars. 
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. 
I am glad to see that you're okay. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good morning. Thank you, Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
I should be the one thanking you. 
I was able to stay conscious, thanks to you. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good morning. You were saved, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, thanks to you holding my hand. I now believe that saying "what happens twice will happen thrice. "
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahem. I'm all for your reunion, but could you bring your attention here, please. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
First of all, congratulations on surviving and completing your mission Fujimaru. Well done. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
While the situation was forced on you gradually, you bravely faced the challenges and overcame it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That earned my respect and appreciation. 
Thanks to you, Mash and Chaldea were saved. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a shame about the Director, but we've no time to hold a service. All we can do is grieve. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If I survived, then maybe the Director...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Listen. We must defend humanity in the Director's place. That's how we pay her tribute. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I got the report about the crystal from Mash, and what Lev said. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
From Chaldea's state, what Lev said was true. 
We can't contact the outside world. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The staff who left Chaldea haven't returned. 
I fear humanity has already been destroyed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chaldea seems to be the only place outside of the normal timeline. Perhaps it's staying on the timeline right before the collapse. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Think of it like a colony floating in space. The outside world is dead, until we do something about this situation. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can we even do it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is there something we can do? 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course. First, I want you to see this. 
We tried scanning Earth with the resurrected Sheba. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's Earth of the past, not the future. 
The Fuyuki Singularity was destroyed, thanks to you. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But we hypothesize that the future was unchanged due to another cause. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The result being&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This distorted world map. A newly-discovered dimensional disturbance against which Fuyuki pales in comparison. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They say changing the past changes the future, but you can't overthrow the future by slightly altering the past. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
History has the power to heal itself. 
You might be able to save a person or two...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...But the end of that era&mdash;
Will still end up with its definitive result unchanged. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But these singularities are different. 
These are humanity's turning points. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"What if this war didn't end? "
"What if this naval voyage wasn't successful? "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"What if this discovery was wrong? "
"What if this nation couldn't become independent? "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The ultimate decision point to determine the current state of humanity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Destroying them is like causing the foundation of human history to crumble. That's what these seven singularities are. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The future had already been decided when these seven singularities formed. As Lev said, humanity doesn't make it to 2019. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;But, we're different. 
Chaldea has yet to reach that future. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Do you understand? Only we can fix this mistake. 
Now we have a chance to return the singularities to normal. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So here's the deal. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rayshift into these seven singularities and get history back on track. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's the only way to save humanity. 
However we are still powerless. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All other Master candidates are frozen. 
Mash is the only Servant we have. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I realize you're being forced into this situation. 
Even so, I'll still say it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Master Candidate #48, Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you wish to save humanity...
If you wish to have a future beyond 2018. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then you alone must go and face these seven singularities in human history. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are you prepared to do this? Can you shoulder the burden of Chaldea and humanity's future? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If it's something I can do. 
 
---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Thank you. 
With those words, our fate has been decided. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We will now carry out the Prevervation of Humanity as laid out by Olga Marie Animusphere, former director of Chaldea. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Our objective is the protection and recovery of human history. Our search target will be each era's relic and Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Our opponent is history itself. Many great Heroic Spirits and legends will stand against you. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Challenging them is an act of blasphemy against the past. To save humanity, we must defy human history. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But this is the only way to survive. 
No, the only way to take back the future. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No matter what sort of end awaits us. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To reflect our determination, we shall abandon the original mission name, First Order. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is now Chaldea's last yet original mission. 
The Grand Order! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In the name of the magical world's highest order. 
We will take back the future!
