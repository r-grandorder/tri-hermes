# GUDAGUDA Meiji Restoration

## Prologue: GUDAGUDA Civilization and Enlightenment
 
**A：Nobbu:**
Ahh...it's springtime.

 
**Okita:**
We're going to have to put away the kotatsu soon.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You two are still here?
 
**A：Nobbu:**
Don't be such a lame. Besides...

 
**A：Nobbu:**
Last time, during the “Super GUDAGUDA Honnoji:
Ginormous Spring Celebration Incident,”

 
**A：Nobbu:**
the super Demon King of the Sixth Heaven awakened just in the nick of time... Yep! It was my awesome heroism that made that event the success it was!

 
**Okita:**
Uh...that was not a real event.
On the other hand...

 
**Okita:**
At the end of “Super GUDAGUDA Shinsengumi:
Okita's Grand Victory”...

 
**Okita:**
...a tan me unleashed a mega-powerful beam attack that was absolutely amazing!

 
**A：Nobbu:**
Hah! Now you're just talking crazy. You don't have an Alter, and everyone knows you can't beam.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No! Don't put it away!
 
**Okita:**
Ah, I knew that Master would appreciate the transience and imperfection of the kotatsu! Now, come, you can sit next to me.

 
**A：Nobbu:**
Hey! Don't push! You're kicking me!
Sheesh, stay on your own side!

 
**A：Nobbu:**
...And hey, where's my mandarin?

 
**Okita:**
Um, it's April. Mandarins are out of season.

 
**Okita:**
Hey, speaking of April, did you play the special April Fools' game?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Why would I!? If it isn't Nobunaga-focused,
then I'm not interested!

 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! There's an intruder in Chaldea!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Nobunaga and Okita. You're...still here...

 
**Mash:**
...Wait a minute! Why are you two lounging in Senpai's room!? M-may I join you?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Still as foxy as ever, eh, Demi&ndash;I mean, Boobie Servant? So, what do you want? What's with all the ruckus?

 
**Mini Nobu:**
Nobbu!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Oh...is there still a dark version of me lurking around?
We did just do the revival event the other day.

 
**???:**
Argh! Move, you weirdo creature! You're mega creepy!
...Wait, creature?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who's there!?
 
**???:**
I'm glad you asked! Chacha is a mysterious masked warrior hailing from another dimension who has come to warn you of terrible impending doom!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A masked man!?
 
**???:**
I'm no man! Chacha is a mysterious masked woman hailing from another dimension who has come to warn you of terrible impending doom!

 

 
**Mash:**
Chacha...is it?

 
**C：???:**
Huh? How did you know Chacha's name!?
Do you have eeyespee?

 
**Okita:**
Chacha...I've heard of her. I believe she was the concubine of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan during the Sengoku* period. (*TL Note: Sengoku=Warring States)

 
**Okita:**
She was the daughter of Nobunaga's younger sister, Oichi. The eldest of the three Azai Sisters, she led a kinda...ill-fated life.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hey! Don't you turn into a history nerd on me!
Wait a minute. Chacha...are you THAT Chacha!?

 
**???:**
Hm? I hear a familiar voice... A-Auntie!?
I thought you got torched by Akechi in Honnoji!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry to butt in when you're all getting excited, but this reading I'm picking up... It's one we've seen before...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Remember? The most awkward of all readings analyzed in Chaldea's history? The Guda Guda Particles.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Explaining would be boring AND painful, so how about you just imagine for yourselves what they do and go with that. See ya☆

 
**Okita:**
You really suck with our event infodumps.
But I guess it's okay. Simplicity makes it easier!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't we get a more detailed explanation...!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The newbies need to know!
 

 
**Mash:**
You KNOW what we're talking about, Senpai!
It's “that thing”!

 
**Mash:**
It's the completely terrifying Guda Guda Particle... Servants it contaminates turn into utter disappointments!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, let's get out of here quickly!
If we don't hurry, even I risk turning into Mashy-Mashy!

 
**Chacha:**
Looks like you're all on the same page now!
Come with Chacha if you want to live!

 
**Chacha:**
...Um, by the way, are you the Master from that Chaldea place?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea, yes.
 
**Chacha:**
Umhm! Good answer! And you've got a good expression on your face! If Chacha says so, it must be true!

 
**Chacha:**
Happy? YOU'RE HAPPY RIGHT?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Argh! Forget about it!
Just hurry up and get us outta here!

 
**Nobunaga:**
I wanted to watch “Get Stella-ed If You Laugh: Chaldea” on TV tonight!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm liking the mask and helmet combo. It's cool.
 
**Chacha:**
Eh!? Cool? I heard that the world of today was dangerous, so I sneaked into His Highness's storage house and took them.

 
**Chacha:**
D-do I look good in them? R-really? Tee hee...
Chacha looks good in anything anyway!

 
**Okita:**
Yes, yes. I have a feeling this is going to be another painful ordeal, but just leave everything to me again, Master!

 

 
**Mash:**
I shall support you from behind the scenes, Senpai!

 
**Chacha:**
Then let's go! Off to some crazy-weird realm Chacha doesn't understand at all!

 
**Okita & Nobunaga:**
What!? You don't understand it!?

 
## Section 1: Blackbeard Arrives
 
**Edward Perryeach:**
Dufufufufu... Open up&ndash;

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fire!!!

 
**Edward Perryeach:**
My role was brief but glorious!

 
**Edward Perryeach:**
My dream of opening up Nippon...and setting up a Pirate Market in Zipangu...!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Welp, all done! Let's go home and watch some TV.

 
**Nobunaga:**
So Chacha, what time period are we in anyway?

 
**Chacha:**
I don't really know, but it doesn't seem like the one Auntie and Chacha lived in; ours was much further back in the past.

 
**Chacha:**
...Wait! That guy wasn't the problem!

 
**Mash:**
..It seems like it's 19th-century Japan. Around the end of the bakufu*, I think. (*TL Note: bakufu=shogunate)

 
**Okita:**
The end...of the shogunate...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, that's when Okita was alive...
 
**Okita:**
Yes, it seems like it was just yesterday, yet it feels so long ago... Something about this feels slightly different, though.

 
**Chacha:**
But that's not what I'm talking about! Chacha didn't come to get your help because of that wacky-looking barbarian.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pre-Meiji Restoration...
 
**Chacha:**
Meiji Restoration? What's that? Cultural reform?
A cheat event in modern-day Japan?

 
**Chacha:**
I see. Well, Chacha isn't interested!

 
**Chacha:**
Hmph! Who cares about that.
Chacha came to you to solve an even greater crisis!

 

 
**Nobu Tank:**
Chacha. Detected. Nobunobu!
Capture. Chacha. Nobunobu!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Eh? Me? A tank? Why am I a tank?

 
**Nobunaga:**
And, you guys can talk!? Did you evolve on your own!?

 
**Chacha:**
They found me!

 
**Chacha:**
N-no! Chacha does not want to go back there!

 
**Chacha:**
There's nothing in that castle anymore!

 
**Okita:**
I'm sure this is all Bad Nobbu's fault, but let's just defeat it! Please stand back, Master!

 
**Chacha:**
Since it's come to this, Ch-Chacha will also help.

 
**Chacha:**
Ha! Touch Chacha, and you'll get burned! Literally!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Chacha:**
Th-that was a close one! I express my thanks to you,
Fujimaru! Chacha will pat you on the head! Hup! Huuup!

 
**Chacha:**
Argh! I can't reach!
Lower your head, you insolent fool! Read the room!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Like this?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Understood!
 

 
**Chacha:**
Hm. You're cute. Chacha is a very tolerant individual, and I like kiddos who are obedient like you!

 
**Chacha:**
But don't fall for me. Chacha is a cute, loving, and popular character type, so to you mass-produced normies, I'm an unattainable prize like from a carnival!

 
**Mash:**
Um, but aren't you a child yourself?

 
**Chacha:**
What!? Don't act all big just because you have big boobies! Chacha in her heyday was all va-va-voom and boin-boin!

 
**Chacha:**
It's not my fault I got summoned as a loli Berserker!

 
**Chacha:**
Uwaa? Chacha's a Berserker!? Wh-how!?

 
**Local Fisherman:**
Whoa, you guys are amazing. First you get rid of that funny-looking foreigner, then you destroy that mechanical doll from the bakufu.

 
**Local Fisherman:**
Honestly, ever since the Oda Bakufu took over last week after defeating Lord Tokugawa, there's been nothing but fighting. I'm sick of it.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh?
 

 
**Okita & Nobunaga:**
Oda Bakufu&mdash;!?

 
**???:**
So you found Chacha...
And who were those people with her?

 
**Mini Nobu:**
Nobunobu! Nobunobu!

 
**???:**
...Riiight... I haven't the slightest idea what that was supposed to mean.

 
**???:**
...Whatever. It doesn't matter who they were.
No one can interfere with my plans!

 
**???:**
That's right, Chacha...
Your pathetic scrambling is pointless!

 
**???:**
This world belongs to me, Oda Nobunaga&ndash;the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!

 
## Section 2: Nobbudamon Incident
 
**Nobunaga:**
Here we are. Kyoto.

 
**Nobunaga:**
So let me get this straight... Without waiting for the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa Bakufu just up and vanished like food around that blue Saber.

 
**Nobunaga:**
And instead, the Oda Bakufu popped up like kettle corn on Chaldea's movie nights?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Ugh! I don't know who did it, but I will NOT allow a new bakufu if I'm not the one who made it!!!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm? This shop's shiruko desserts are the best!

 
**Chacha:**
I want some, I want some! Chacha loves sweet shiruko soup! Stewing adzuki beans into a sweet soup is such a devilish idea!

 
**Chacha:**
It's scary-good!

 
**Okita:**
Shiruko has always been sweet...

 
**Okita:**
Wait a minute. Did shiruko even exist during your lifetime, Nobbu?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Yup. I picked up this guy once, real strange dude.
He was a chef who made all kinda weird and exotic stuff.

 
**Nobunaga:**
But the shiruko he made by stewing adzuki beans was exquisite! Oichi and Chacha both loved it!

 
**Chacha:**
He dressed kinda weird, but he made delicious things, so Chacha loved him.

 
**Chacha:**
But then he just disappeared one day... The horror.

 
**Okita:**
Uh...this doesn't sound like a super-accurate version of history.

 
**Purple-haired Tea Shop Girl:**
I'm glad you are enjoying my food.

 
**Purple-haired Tea Shop Girl:**
Eh? Me? U-um...I am just an insignificant town girl, so please do not mind me.

 
**Purple-haired Tea Shop Girl:**
I did it! My part is done! (Victory dance)

 
**Okita:**
Huh? That flashy-looking girl seemed familiar...

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Chacha. You're spilling your shiruko. Come on now, wipe your mouth, too. And Senpai, please have some dumplings.

 
**Chacha:**
Hm. I thank you, boobie-somethingsomething.

 
**Chacha:**
Hey. Your dumplings look good too.
Hand one to Chacha! Gimme!

 
**Nobunaga:**
What's with all the commotion?

 
**Villager:**
Go take a look! The Oda and Shinsengumi folks are at each other's throats again!

 
**Okita:**
...The Shinsengumi!?

 
**E：???:**
What's wrong with you!? Why are you getting in the way? You're being disrespectful to Oda Nobunaga, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!

 
**F：???:**
Shut up... It's the Shinsengumi's job to get rid of that...thing. Now die, all of you... If not, you'll all be exterminated!

 
**E：Oda Nobunaga?:**
Die or be exterminated? Eh? Isn't that the same thing?
Just who is this fool!?

 
**E：Oda Nobunaga?:**
Dammit! I will not allow the galling lack of respect you've shown to me, the great Heroic Spirit Oda Nobunaga!

 
**E：Oda Nobunaga?:**
I am the unparalleled hero who will save Japan!
Go, my elite Oda Bakufu goon squad!

 
**Mini Nobu & Giant Nobu:**
Nobunobu!

 
**F：???:**
Hmph. I don't care what you are!
Just shut up and come at me!

 
**Mash:**
That is...eh? N-Nobunaga?

 
**Chacha:**
Hm? Auntie is already here.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Th-there's another one of me...!? And not the bad me?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That one looks like a dude.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it the real Lord Nobunaga? That means Nobbu is...
 

 
**Nobbu:**
No, no. I'm the real deal! If you're talking about the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga, then I'm the one and only!

 
**Mash:**
It's true that Oda Nobunaga is commonly regarded as male... Does that mean our Nobunaga was a fake?

 
**Chacha:**
Now we are learning the real historical truth...
Even His Highness had no clue that Auntie was a phony!

 
**Nobbu:**
Et tu, Chacha!?

 
**Nobbu:**
Argh! Okita! Say something! We're rivals, right?
Tell them I'm the real Nobunaga!

 
**Okita:**
...That's... No, it can't be...

 
**Mash:**
...Okita!?

 
**Okita:**
...M-Mr. Hijikata! It IS you, isn't it!?

 
**Hijikata:**
...What's all this? ...Oh, Okita, it's only you.

 
**Hijikata:**
Good timing. You go around from the right.
Shinsengumi, advance!

 
**Okita:**
I'm not ready! Wait, wait, what the heck's going on!?
And who's the Nobbu lookalike!?

 
**Oda Nobunaga?:**
Heh heh. I'm glad you asked! I am one who has returned from beyond the veil of death to this age of decadence...

 
**Oda Nobunaga?:**
The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga!

 
**Oda Nobunaga?:**
Oh-ho... So there's another me in this world.
Who'd have thought it!

 
**Oda Nobunaga?:**
Hm? Do I hear a voice that stirs feelings of nostalgia...and yet that I really don't want to hear?

 
**A：Oda Nobunaga:**
What the what! It's you, Nobukatsu!

 
**E：Oda Nobukatsu:**
Oh crap! Big Sister!?

 
**E：Oda Nobukatsu:**
Arrrrgh...why are you here!?

 
**A：Oda Nobunaga:**
That's my line! Why are you here!? And why are you calling yourself the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!? And why did you make a new Oda Bakufu!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Ack! Look, I have a perfectly good explanation. You see, the people cried out for a shining hero to save this world from its decadent ways!

 
**Chacha:**
Now that you mention it, I think Mother told me that she and Auntie had a dead younger brother.

 
**Chacha:**
At least I think she did.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Doesn't matter! Younger brother or not, taking my name is outrageous! I shall properly punish him!

 
**Hijikata:**
Hey, girlie. That's my prey.
Hands off.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Huh...? Who the heck are you?
And do you know who I AM!?

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata!? That Nobbu isn't the bad Nobbu...

 
**Okita:**
Well, she's not exactly a particularly good Nobbu either...

 
**Hijikata:**
Okita! When did you get so soft!?
Are you planning on ending your life in shame!?

 
**Okita:**
Just take my word and hold back for the time being, please! Nobbu, that's okay with you too, right? I beg of you too, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's all just...try and be friends here...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Sigh) What a mess...
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
...Hmph. Fine. First we deal with Nobukatsu.
Nobukatsu, where are you camped?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Lead the way. We'll talk when we get there.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Yes, Big Sister! This way! We, the army of the Oda Bakufu, will do our very absolute best! We'll work ourselves to the bone! Please show a little mercy!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Men, withdraw!

 
**Mini Nobu:**
Nobunobu!

 
**Hijikata:**
Tch. Fine. Okita! Back to headquarters!

 
**Okita:**
Eh? Headquarters? As in, the Shinsengumi's?
U-uh, well...

 
**Okita:**
O-okay. Then, Master, please come with us!

 
**Nobunaga:**
What? Fujimaru is obviously coming with me.

 
**Okita:**
What are you talking about!?
Master is coming with me to Shinsengumi HQ!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fool! Fujimaru is my retainer for all eternity!

 
**Nobunaga:**
There's no way I'm handing Master over to a puny man-slayers club!

 
**Okita:**
Who are you calling “puny”!?

 
**Okita:**
Come, Master. To the Shinsengumi with me.

 
**Nobunaga:**
No! Fujimaru is coming with me!

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha knows what this is.
This is what you call a lover's quarrel.

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha knows all about it. I've seen my fair share of them. Many people fight over Chacha's affections.

 
**Mash:**
Wh-what should we do, Senpai?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Join the Oda Bakufu.
 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm! That's my Master! Chacha, you come too!
I will solve this matter in one fell swoop!

 
**Okita:**
B-but...! F-fine! Well...even if you say you want to join the Shinsengumi later, I'm not gonna let you!

 
**Okita:**
Waaah! Master, you lawless ronin!

 
**Chacha:**
Goodbye. Now that I think about it, we didn't do any proper introductions, so farewell, frail-looking moe side character!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Join the Shinsengumi.
 
**Okita:**
Wonderful choice, Master. In that case, I shall train you until you are a worthy soldier of the Shinsengumi!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Wh-what...!? Are you declining to be my retainer!?
E-even Monkey was super excited to serve me!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fool! Even if you come groveling back to beg for my forgiveness, you... you may or may not get it!

 
**Chacha:**
Auntie... What an unexpected fall from grace.

 
**Chacha:**
Trying to be all tsundere isn't going to fly in this Azuchi-Momoyama period!

 

 
**Chacha:**
Eh? Chacha's going with you because you seem more interesting.

 
**Chacha:**
Actually, my feet hurt, so I just don't want to walk anymore.

 
**Chacha:**
If you're going somewhere, give me a piggyback ride!
Carry Chacha!

 
**Mash:**
...Th-this is turning out to be quite a bother, Senpai...

 
## End Section: Let's Go, Our Oda Bakufu!
 
**Nobunaga:**
Hahahaha! I'd expect nothing less from my Master!
That puny man-slayers club is no match for us!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Impressive, Lord Fujimaru!
Such wonderful manipulation of Big Sister!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
With the funds we've collected, the new weapon for our great bakufu will soon be completed!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think I earned more than I meant to...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel bad for Okita.
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Ha. I'm in a good mood, so I'll put dealing with Nobukatsu on hold for now. I'll think of a punishment after we beat that man-slayers club.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Aaand on a totally different note, don't you think this tea room is gaudy? Isn't it too shiny? There's not an ounce of elegant taste here.

 
**Chacha:**
This is the same as His Highness's golden tea room.
It brings back memories, but it's too flashy! Makes Chacha's eyes hurt!

 
**Chacha:**
Did Uncle Nobukatsu build this?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Eh!? Well, this room was given to me by our shogunate's sponsor, or something like that... Yeah, let's just go with that.

 
**Nobunaga:**
What? So this is Monkey's preferred décor, huh?
He did like sparkly things.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I have prepared your room the same way, Lord Fujimaru, so please make yourself at home.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Big Sister, if you will excuse me... I am heading out for a meeting with a weapons merchant. Goodbye!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm. Do as you see fit.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Okay! Maybe we should head over to that man-slayers club so we can make fun of their measly shack!

 
**Chacha:**
Auntie, too mean!

 
**Chacha:**
But that seems fun, so Chacha's going too!
Fujimaru, piggyback! Piggybaaack!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I hope Okita's okay.
 

 
**Okita:**
Of course I'm not okay!

 
**Okita:**
Thanks to this event, the Shinsengumi's tight on funds for the first time since its establishment! Well, okay, it's kind of always been that way...

 
**Okita:**
All day long, we only eat a sad menu of rice with hot water and pickles... I wish I could have something sweet...

 
**Hijikata:**
Quit your whining.

 
**Hijikata:**
Rice with hot water and pickles is enough.
It tastes fine.

 
**Okita:**
No, I think you just stockpiled too many pickles.

 
**Okita:**
I mean, what's up with the storehouse being completely filled with pickles!?

 
**Okita:**
It should have been filled with military provisions!
Honestly, spending all our war funds on pickles...!

 
**Okita:**
Man cannot live on pickles alone!

 
**Okita:**
Argh. How does it happen that Mr. Hijikata and I are the only members of the Shinsengumi to manifest in this world!?

 
**Okita:**
This isn't the Shinsengumi...
It's like the Shinsen-pair!

 
**Hijikata:**
Shut up. There's plenty of members.

 
**Mini Nobu?:**
Nobu!

 
**Okita:**
For the last time, what exactly are these Mini Nobus!?

 
**Okita:**
Eh? You're saying they're the righteous Mini Nobus who escaped because they started to question Oda's ways?

 
**Okita:**
I didn't realize those things could be ambitious!
Even if it's just a tiny bit...

 
**Okita:**
Argh. If only Master had helped me out, something like this wouldn't have happened...

 
**Okita:**
(Worried cough)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, hey, Okita. How are you feeling?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rice with hot water and pickles... How refined!
 

 
**Hijikata:**
Hm? Aren't you...the brat hanging around Okita? What business does the dog of the Oda Bakufu have with us?

 
**Okita:**
M-Master!? You came!

 
**Okita:**
I knew it...I knew it...
Master's too smart not to see what an idiot Nobbu is!

 
**Nobunaga:**
WRONG! Couldn't be further from the truth!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fujimaru only came with me to make fun of this sad shack standing in this shanty city!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Whoa, so shabby! This place really is sad! Okita, if you stick around here, you'll die of a common cold!

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha also came to ridicule this place!

 
**Chacha:**
Huh... So this is what it looks like. Touring the city and seeing old, sad ruins like this is so hip and fun! Even if it is with the Shinsengumi!

 
**Okita:**
“Ruins”? “Shack”? You've gone too far this time, Nobbu!
I will not allow you to deceive our purehearted Master!

 
**Hijikata:**
Hey, quiet there. (Crunch crunch) If you're going to make a ruckus, do it outside. (Nomming on pickles)

 
**Okita:**
Please say something, Mr. Hijikata!

 
**Nobusengumi:**
Nobu, nobunobu!

 
**Okita:**
Eh? What's this all of a sudden?
Is there something you want to tell us?

 
**Hijikata:**
Ah. The spy I sent into the city.
Let's hear your report.

 
**Nobusengumi:**
Nobu! (Hands letter)

 
**Nobunaga:**
Spying? I didn't know you guys were smart enough to do such advanced things.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hey wait a minute...
Where do you get off sneaking away to betray me!?

 
**Hijikata:**
This is...

 
**Hijikata:**
Okita! We're moving out! Prepare yourself! Quickly!

 
**Okita:**
Eh? Did something big happen?

 
**Hijikata:**
Yeah... Looks like some lawless ronin have gathered in a plot to torch Kyoto!

 
**Hijikata:**
...And the secret meeting site is...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could it be...!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know!
 

 
**Okita:**
...The Ikedaya!

 
## End Section: Go, Go! Everyone's Shinsengumi!
 
**Okita:**
We did it, Master! It's been a while,
but this is a great victory for me!

 
**Okita:**
The Oda Bakufu is nothing more than a withering blossom that will bear no fruit. A weed!

 
**Okita:**
But, thanks to Master collecting so much for our war coffers, the Shinsengumi has reached new heights of wealth and power!

 
**Okita:**
I...um, well, I'm kinda embarrassed to say that the Shinsengumi was never exactly financially stable.
So this is like a dream come true!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hm, I think I ate too many apples.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel bad for Nobbu...
 

 
**Chacha:**
I'm sure Auntie's fine. Chacha has no reason to believe that, but Chacha does anyway!

 
**Chacha:**
Anyway, the Shinsengumi's so boooring.

 
**Chacha:**
Even your uniforms suck!
Why don't you make them more sparkly!?

 
**Okita:**
Heh... Chacha doesn't seem to understand the greatness of this mountain pattern.

 
**Okita:**
Well, it's Mr. Kondou's design, and I guess it really was a bit too flashy. So Mr. Hijikata hardly wore it.

 
**Hijikata:**
...Shut it, Okita. How was today's patrol?

 
**Okita:**
Oh, Mr. Hijikata, what do you think?
What do you think of my Master?

 
**Okita:**
As you can see, Master is a...um...master of collecting funds, and we're not so great at it. Why not let [♂ him /♀her]
officially join as a member?

 
**Hijikata:**
Hmph. I'm not so sure about that. Hey, you. I don't mind a little fundraising, but report to me about it first!

 
**Hijikata:**
If you don't, then...

 
**Hijikata:**
SEPPUKU!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-of course! I'm all about communication!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-I actually used some to get materials...
 

 
**Okita:**
I-it'll be fine!

 
**Okita:**
As a senior officer, I will keep a watchful eye.
Right, Master?

 
**Hijikata:**
Got it. You...Try not to make Okita slice up her guts.

 
**Hijikata:**
Well, what happened to your patrol? Get going!

 
**Chacha:**
Sheesh. He looks scary, and he's so bossy.

 
**Chacha:**
Well, Chacha wants to go shopping in the city,
so let's go.

 
**Okita:**
(Sigh) But the other officers...

 
**Nobusengumi:**
Nobu!

 
**Okita:**
For the last time, what exactly are these Mini Nobus!?

 
**Okita:**
Eh? You're saying they're the righteous Mini Nobus who escaped because they started to question Oda's ways?

 
**Okita:**
I didn't realize those things could be ambitious!
Even if it's just a tiny bit...

 
**Hijikata:**
We use the tools we have.
There's no rule that says our officers have to be human.

 
**Okita:**
Uh... Why would there even need to be a rule for that!? It's just common sense!

 
**Okita:**
Argh. How is it that Mr. Hijikata and I are the only officers of the Shinsengumi to manifest in this world!?

 
**Okita:**
This isn't the Shinsengumi... It's like the Shinsen-pair!

 
**Okita:**
What do you think, Master? Only the First Unit has a captain, so there are a lot of open positions! You can't pass this opportunity up!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-I think I'd rather join as a trial member...
 
**Okita:**
Oh...I see... Well, I can't force you.
I will arrange it so that you join for a trial period.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Your meal plan isn't exactly a selling point...
 
**Okita:**
I'm sorry. Rice with hot water and pickles is Mr. Hijikata's favorite, so he's got barrels and barrels of it! An entire storehouse, in fact!

 
**Okita:**
P-please bear with us for another...six months or so! That's when it'll all run out!

 

 
**Okita:**
All right. I'm curious as to what Nobbu is doing right now, so shall we go on patrol, Master?

 
**Okita:**
First Unit Captain of the Shinsengumi, Okita Souji, heading out!

 
**Chacha:**
Ah! Sounds fun! Chacha's going too!

 
**Chacha:**
Um... The Shinsengumi's super-important, cutest MVP Chacha, out!

 
**Chacha:**
Should we slice something up for starters?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Trial officer, also moving out!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wonder how Nobbu is doing...?
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
How do you think, idiot!?

 
**Nobunaga:**
The great Oda Bakufu is in financial trouble! As I was known as the Sengoku period's economics prodigy through my free markets and open guilds, this is just embarrassing!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Well, the idea of shaking down neighboring states because one is low on rice...is pretty much the oldest form of wartime economy...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Nowadays, being international&ndash;like opening up the country or achieving cultural enlightenment&ndash;is the way to go.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Argh, don't talk to me like you know everything, you fool! And what's with this gaudy golden room!?

 
**Nobunaga:**
The feeling's all off, and if you have money to spend on something like this, there's other things you should be doing!

 
**Nobunaga:**
This wouldn't have happened if Fujimaru had just come to work for me...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh hey, Nobbu. How's it going?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whoa, is Kintoki your decorator?
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Well, well, if it isn't Fujimaru!

 
**Nobunaga:**
I knew you'd get tired of being a man-slayer&ndash;with all that dumb murdering&ndash;and become a wanderer dedicated to helping others, fighting bad guys...

 
**Nobunaga:**
...and that in the end you'd come to the realization that you should have sided with Nobbu, and so come crawling back to me!

 
**Okita:**
Uh...no.

 
**Okita:**
Master has come with me to patrol the city, and we just swung by to see what the Oda Bakufu stronghold looked like.

 
**Chacha:**
Oh, and Chacha mostly came to shop, but also decided to check things out here!

 
**Chacha:**
Whoa, this place looks gloomy...

 
**Chacha:**
I'm so glad I didn't follow Auntie!
Chacha can't handle being poor and stuff!

 
**Okita:**
From the look of this place, the glory of the Oda Bakufu is long gone!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Arrrgh! You puny man-slayer club dorks have no right to say that kinda crap! Nobukatsu! Hurry up and kick these folks out! Nobukaaatsuuuuuu!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm? Where did he go?
Argh, everybody keeps getting in my way!

 
**Nobusengumi:**
Nobunobbu! (Hands letter)

 
**Nobunaga:**
Eh? What's this? Nobusengumi? Hey wait a minute...
Where do you get off sneaking away to betray me!?

 
**Okita:**
What is it? A messenger from Mr. Hijikata?
A letter? Well let's see... Th-this is...!?

 
**Okita:**
Master! This is bad... Looks like some lawless roushi have gathered in a plot to torch Kyoto!

 
**Okita:**
...And the secret meeting site is...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could it be...!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know!
 

 
**Okita:**
...The Ikedaya!

 
## Section 3: GUDAGUDA Ikedaya Tumble
 
**???:**
We have received the shipment, and the funds will be wired to your account.

 
**???:**
Mmm. Leave the mass production to us from here on.

 
**???:**
Hmph. My company's products are much higher quality, you know.

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
What did you say!? Are you calling the United Satsuma Corporation's products inferior!? This volume, at these prices!?

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
I am the great Saigou Edimori, king of the United Satsuma Corporation! How dare you speak to me so disrespectfully!?

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
This is why bigheaded AC Choushu are so uncivilized...!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Well, I'm only stating the truth. Choushu Industries' products are far superior in terms of specifications!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Katsura Tesla, CEO, guarantees it!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
I would appreciate it if you wouldn't lump us together with DC Satsuma's draconian employment conditions. Don't you think a 23-hour workday is absolutely barbaric?

 
**???:**
Please, both of you... Now is the time to cooperate in order to reach our mutual goal.

 
**???:**
United Satsuma's production skills and Choushu Industries' mysterious engineering... With their combined power, nothing can stand in our way!

 
**???:**
That's right! The ultimate union of technology: the SatChou Alliance!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Well if that's how our sponsor puts it... In service of the greater good, let us put aside our personal grudges. Right, Katsura?

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Well, it is true that no invention would be possible without proper funding, Edimori.

 
**???:**
Fortunately, we are financially stable, so I'm looking forward to further collaborations. Hee hee hee hee.

 
**Okita:**
This is a raid!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Huh!? Who's there!?

 
**Okita:**
First Unit Captain of the Shinsengumi, Okita Souji...
in the flesh!

 
**Okita:**
You lawless roushi, I won't hesitate to slice you up if you resist!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
What!? The Shinsengumi!?

 
**???:**
Oh crap... W-well then, I'm going to leave this to you SatChou leaders! I'm taking my leave!

 
**Okita:**
...You're not going anywhere!

 
**???:**
Nobbu!

 
**Okita:**
Wha...!? What the heck is this!? A Mini Nobu!? A robot!?

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Hahaha! Behold! This is the great United Satsuma's wondrous creation, the “MN-01”...also known as Mecha Nobbu!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mecha Nobbu... They actually made one!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, this isn't getting any less ridiculous.
 

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
The best part is our production pace! We can make one every five minutes without so much as a drop of glue!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
At my factory, these are mass-produced round the clock with our 23-hour workdays! It all boils down to numbers when it comes to battle, people of Japan!

 
**Okita:**
...This is bad. There's just too many of them. Maybe splitting up with Mr. Hijikata wasn't such a good idea!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll be fine as long as we have you, Okita.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's scrap 'em before Hijikata shows up!
 

 
**Okita:**
...!

 
**Okita:**
Leave this to me, Master!

 
**Okita:**
Heh heh heh... My Kiku-Ichimonji shines with a different light tonight!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nobukatsu:**
Whew. That was close. I almost got caught.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Who knows what would have happened if Big Sister had found out.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
She'd just start throwing around stuff like seppuku all willy-nilly.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
But if the SatChou lot manages to take her out for me,
I can finally be the official head of the Oda clan!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
My rise to power is inevitable now!

 
**Nobunaga:**
You're right... Inevitable.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Yep, totally inev&ndash;

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Oh crap! Big Sister!!! I-I, um, this is all according to keikaku... I-I mean, this is all just a big misunderstanding...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
You may be family, but you've exhausted my patience! Nobukatsu! You just wait right there!

 
**Chacha:**
Auntie... She's usually so soft on her family members... Even Ranmaru and Nagayoshi did whatever they wanted.

 
**Chacha:**
Well, I guess it's time to pay the piper.

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Hold it right there, Mademoiselle Lord Nobunaga!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Behold! The Blavatsky Research Institute and my Choushu Industries worked together to develop...

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
...the “MNN-01”! Also known as the Nobbu UFO!

 
**Nobbu UFO:**
Nononono...bubububu!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobbu UFO!?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Argh, you're stealing my brand!
You owe me for copyright infringement!

 
**Chacha:**
Ewww, they're creepy!

 
**Nobbu UFO:**
Nonoh!? Bubu!? (Crash)

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Ah! Stop! They may not look it, but the Nobbu UFOs are extremely fragile (psychologically)!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
So those schoolyard insults really sting!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
That was helpful, Katsura Tesla! I knew Choushu was better than those useless, shouty Satsuma barbarians!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
See you you-know-when, you-know-where,
for the you-know-what!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Ah!? Hold it, Nobukatsu!
Argh, these weird UFO-mes are so annoying!

 
**Okita:**
...Haa!

 
**Mecha Nobbu:**
Nobaaaaaah!?

 
**Mecha Nobbu:**
Nobbu, nooobbu!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Wahahaha! There's plenty more of them!
Looks like you're running low on fuel... Care to give up?

 
**Okita:**
(Pant...pant...) I'm still good! Master!
Use a Command Spell! Let's get them in one swoo&ndash;

 
**Okita:**
(Cough!?)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okita!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Careful, Okita, the stairs...!
 

 
**Okita:**
Ah...!

 
**Hijikata:**
...What do you think you're doing, Okita?
This is no time to fall asleep on the job!

 
**Okita:**
...M-Mr. Hijikata!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're saved!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okita...I'm glad you're okay!
 

 
**Hijikata:**
Yes, hello. Fujimaru...was it?
You've done well up until now. Leave the rest to us.

 
**Hijikata:**
...Everyone, draw your swords.

 
**Hijikata:**
Let none escape!

 
**Hijikata:**
NOW IS THE HOUR OF

 
**Hijikata:**
THE SHINSENGUMI!!!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Hijikata:**
Time to end this!!!

 
**Mecha Nobbu:**
No...buuuuun...

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
I-impossible... My entire fleet of Mecha Nobbus...eradicated... Annihilated!

 
**Hijikata:**
Good... Tie him up.
We'll interrogate him back at our base.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hey, are you guys all done here too?
Looks like his buddy has given up too.

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Sending an Archer to attack Riders seems quite unfair.
The Nobbu UFOs were dropping like flies.

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha did good too!
I shot flames out of my arms at them!

 
**Chacha:**
Wait a minute! Ahhh!
Why do flames come out of Chacha's arms!?

 
**Hijikata:**
...We'll interrogate that one at our place too.
If you've no more business, begone!

 
**Nobunaga:**
What!? That's our line. I'm taking that lion-head with me. You should be the one to skedaddle.

 
**Hijikata:**
...So you're trying to take all the credit.

 
**Okita:**
Would both of you please calm down...

 
**Okita:**
(Cough!)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't we all just get along?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uh-oh...those two are...!
 

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Ah-ha! Now's my chance!
Blinding Edimori Shoulder Flash!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
They don't call me the Fleeing Katsura for nothing!
Behold! KT Body Flashbang!

 
**Chacha:**
Whaah! It's bright! My eyes!!! Chacha's eyes!!!

 
**Chacha:**
Ah! Chacha's mask to the rescue!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Wahahaha! We shall say farewell for now!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Note that my United Satsuma factory in Toba is rolling out tens of thousands of Mecha Nobbus as we speak!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
And Choushu Industry Technics in Fushimi is also currently conducting tests with an even more powerful weapon! I suggest you prepare yourselves!

 
**Saigou Edimori & Katsura Tesla:**
Wahahahaha! We shall meet again!

 
**Hijikata:**
Tch. This is all your fault. You let them escape...

 
**Hijikata:**
So their headquarters is in Toba-Fushimi...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hmph. Either way, the Oda Bakufu's going to kick all of their butts.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fujimaru, we're leaving.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But Okita is...!
 

 
**Okita:**
I...am...fine.

 
**Okita:**
I can...still...fight...

 
## Section 4: Universal Battle of Toba-Fushimi
 
**Chacha:**
How is she? Has her fever broken?

 
**Okita:**
Master... Chacha...

 
**Okita:**
I'm at...headquarters?

 
**Okita:**
...Oh right...this again...

 
**Okita:**
Thank you for taking care of me... I'm fine now.

 
**Okita:**
(Cough!?)

 
**Chacha:**
Yes, you sound muuuch better. You just stay right there in bed and don't worry about a thing.

 
**Chacha:**
Silly kids should listen to grown-ups.

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha will watch over you and make you all better!
You just rest as much as you want!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep, you need to lie down.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll bring rice porridge and pickles.
 

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. Do you have a moment?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where have you been?
 

 
**Mash:**
Sorry for disappearing so long.

 
**Mash:**
...It's just, while you were heading towards the Ikedaya,
I asked Da Vinci to perform an analysis of this realm...

 
**Mash:**
I'd rather not speak of it here. Is there somewhere we can talk privately?

 
**Chacha:**
Hm? Do as you please. Chacha will watch over her. Chacha is the best at nursing people back to health.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you say so... Take care of Okita, then.
 
**Chacha:**
Yes! Okita will get better in no time with Chacha on the case! If you want, Chacha can go on stage and sing lullabies.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're like a tiny mommy.
 
**Chacha:**
Don't say dumb things like that! Is it just 'cause Chacha is a Berserker!?

 
**Chacha:**
Just go do your thingy!

 

 
**Mash:**
I had Da Vinci research this realm, and it apparently turned out to be a bit unusual...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey, how's it going? I wasn't really interested in doing this, but Mash insisted, so I performed an analysis.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What did you find out?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't it the usual mess of a realm?
 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, I thought it was just like the last similar disaster you walked into, or just another Singularity...

 
**Da Vinci:**
But let me cut to the chase: this realm is in a kind of stasis.

 
**Mash:**
Stasis... Does that mean time won't go forward?
It can't move into the future?

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's right. That place isn't a Singularity of a specific point in history, nor is it a time in history that's been altered.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It is just a single point in time that's unconnected to the past, and to the future.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I initially thought it was some parallel world's history that got derailed somewhere along the line.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But it's not. It's a world where time has stopped there, and ONLY there. If we think of human history as a narrative spanning thousands of volumes...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...then that world would be like a series that ended only a single volume. It is...entirely unrelated to human history.

 
**Mash:**
A world that ends in a single volume...

 
**Da Vinci:**
The Guda Guda Particle is a fuzzy concept, but this is actually the opposite... I can sense an unwavering will behind this.

 
**Da Vinci:**
A strong will that's saying “it ends here,” or “nothing beyond this point is necessary.”

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Chacha:**
You dummy!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That came from Okita's room!
 

 
**Mash:**
Wait, Senpai!?
We'll call you back, Da Vinci!

 
**Hijikata:**
Wake up, Okita. It's time for battle. We are headed to Toba-Fushimi. The enemy has apparently gathered there.

 
**Chacha:**
Shut up, you muscle-brained, man-slaying, scary-faced jerk! She's in no shape to move! Get out!

 
**Okita:**
I-I'm all right...! A burning fever is nothing to the powerful, invincible Okita...

 
**Okita:**
 
(Cough!?)

 
**Hijikata:**
If you're coughing up blood, then you must have plenty to spare. Obviously your lungs are strong. Good, then. The Oda lot have already assembled. Let's go.

 
**Chacha:**
No, no, no, it's not okay, dummy!
...And you too!

 
**Chacha:**
Kids who catch a cold need to stay home and rest!

 
**Okita:**
Thank you for being concerned for me, Chacha.
But I...

 
**Okita:**
I am the Shinsengumi's First Unit Captain, Okita Souji.

 
**Okita:**
Now let's go, Master! I cannot allow Nobbu to be the only one to look cool!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okita...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Got it. Let's go.
 

 
**Chacha:**
...Oh come on! You military stooges are all the same!

 
**Chacha:**
What's the point of pride and honor if they just get you killed!?

 
**Chacha:**
You're all stupid! Stupid stupidheads! No! You know what you are? Stupid dum-dum doodyheads!

 
**Chacha:**
Argh! Chacha can't deal with you anymore! Chacha's gonna wreck all your dummy plans from now on!

 
**Chacha:**
Oh, but first, here's some medicine for you, dummy, so take it after you eat! Brats!

 
**Okita:**
Chacha...

 
**Mash:**
I wonder why she got so mad...

 
**Hijikata:**
Hmph. If she were one of us, she would have to commit seppuku for deserting us before a battle.

 
**Hijikata:**
Whatever. Shinsengumi, moving out.

 
**Mecha Nobbu:**
Nobu nobbuu!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
Wahahahaha! What do you think of the new and incredible robot army that my United Satsuma has mass-produced for us!?

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
I had some time to tweak them a little, and so their production rate and performance went up by 20%! This is all thanks to our 24-hour workdays!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
I see you're still not at all timid about breaking labor laws!

 
**Nobbu UFO:**
Nonononono bubububu!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
And my new Choushu Industries superweapon is finally out of its prototype phase and in official production!

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
Even matchlock guns are no match against them!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
This is the indomitable strength of the Universal SatChou Alliance!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Heh. This will be the end of Big Sister's reign!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Why you... So many variants of me crawling all over the place...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm? You guys are here too? What took you so long?
Can't you see that the enemy's all locked and loaded!?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Huh? Fujimaru, wasn't Chacha with you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She disappeared somewhere...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something happened right before we left...
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
She was tending to Okita on her sickbed...!?

 
**Nobunaga:**
I see... Oh, that Chacha...

 
**Nobunaga:**
No matter. She'll be back when she gets hungry.

 
**Nobunaga:**
And you're... Uh, Hijikata, was it? Of the Shinsengumi?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Well, what's your assessment of the enemy, then?

 
**Hijikata:**
There's too many... Our only options would be to pin them down with a feint, and then have a separate unit flank them...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Oh-ho... I thought your little man-slayers club was all about playing at being soldiers, but maybe I was wrong. I had more or less the same idea, in fact.

 
**Nobunaga:**
I guess you've got at least a little tactical sense.

 
**Nobunaga:**
But you're a bit lacking in numbers.

 
**Hijikata:**
...So what? You work with what you've got...
That is what war is about.

 
**Hijikata:**
Okita, you'll flank them.
I'll handle the feint at their front ranks.

 
**Okita:**
Underst&ndash;
(Cough!?)

 
**Okita:**
N-no. It's fine! I'm fine!

 
**Nobunaga:**
You are NOT fine.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Just hear me out: I'll lead the feint attack from the front. It's the best fit. Most of my troops carry matchlock guns, and aren't that mobile.

 
**Nobunaga:**
That leaves everyone else free for the flanking maneuver. What do you think? Pretty cunning, huh?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A united front with Nobbu and the Shinsengumi!
 
**Okita:**
I-I see... That is a good idea, especially considering the source... We ARE understaffed... What do you think,
Mr. Hijikata?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Eh!? Nobbu had a good idea!?
 
**Nobunaga:**
What's that supposed to mean!? I don't wanna brag, but pretty much never lost a battle! (*Note: Nobunaga lost the battle of Kanegasaki, but we don't talk about that.)

 

 
**Hijikata:**
...Fine. I guess that'll be better than losing...

 
**Hijikata:**
Nobunaga... After all your big talk, you'd better not mess this up.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Of course. If you guys aren't careful, I'll take you all out together! So you'd better head out like you're planning not to come back!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fujimaru, what are you going to do?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cooperate with the Shinsengumi.
 
**Okita:**
If Master's with us, there's nothing to fear!
Hijikata, let's go!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Cooperate with Nobbu.
 
**Nobunaga:**
Haha! Now you'll get a real lesson in my famous Three Line Formation!!!

 

 
**Nobunaga:**
This will be a glorious race to see who can win the greater honor on the battlefield!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Matchlock troops, ready yourselves!!!

 
**Hijikata:**
Yes, a race to glory! We will not lose to the likes of her! Shinsengumi, advance!

 
## End Section: We Won! Oda Bakufu Finishes!
 
**Nobunaga:**
Now! Push them out! Matchlock troops, switch out and reload for the next shot! My invincible Noble Phantasm, Three Line Formation, will finish this!

 
**Mecha Nobbu:**
 
Nobbuaaaahh!?

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
I-impossible...!?

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
My United Satsuma-produced Mecha Nobbu unit is being completely annihilated!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa! We're holding them back!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nobbu! You're amazing!
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Of course! I am a tactical genius! Makes you wonder how come I don't have a better skill set, right? You know, it's never too late for that strengthening quest thing.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Fujimaru, you've done well too!
Even Monkey's never done such a magnificent job!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Upon our victory, you'll be richly rewarded, and then make it DOUBLE! Wahahahaha! Unification under the great Oda Bakufu is so close I can taste it!

 
**Nobunaga:**
We'll have a huge barbecue after-party at the temple when we're all done!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not at a temple, please.
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Eh? R-really?
But I'll make some tea and everything...?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
C-crap! She's too strong!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
N-no, maybe it's because of that...whatsitsname...Fujimaru?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Is [♂ he /♀ she] helping Sis...?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Fine. Change of plans!

 
**Chacha:**
Awww. So in the end, Auntie wins...
I was all worried for nothing.

 
**Chacha:**
Sheesh. Leaving Chacha behind like that to go fight? Rude! Why are warriors and adults all like that?

 
**Chacha:**
Hm? Isn't that...Uncle Nobukatsu?
Where's he running off to...?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...Yes, I see... All we have to do is take out that Fujimaru [♂ guy /♀ girl]...

 
**Chacha:**
...Who is he talking to?
Shoot, I can't hear that well...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Yes, that's right. If we can take care of that, Chacha can return to our great Taikou...

 
**Chacha:**
...!? T-Taikou...!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Who's there!? ...Oh, it's you, Chacha.
You caught me in a bit of an awkward position here...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Naughty Chacha...eavesdropping...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
That's right. I was summoned to be His Highness Taikou's servant right from the beginning.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Now that you're here, I'm going to send you back to the castle.

 
**Chacha:**
Taikou... H-His Highness is in the castle!?

 
**Chacha:**
Th-that's impossible! His Highness is gone!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Oh, so you know.
Death hasn't stopped either of us, has it?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
That's because this is THAT kind of world...

 
**Chacha:**
N-no, no, no, no, no!!!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
I've lost... I wasn't productive enough...
Next time, I will try for 36-hour workdays...

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
(Sigh) War is truly terrible. All that work,
and we even got help from Ms. Blavatsky...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Whew. It's finally done.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Yes! Now that we're all done, I'll put on a private production of my favorite play, Atsumori, back at the temple for everyone!

 
**Okita:**
Master! Nobbu! I'm glad you're both safe. We finished mopping up the enemy forces on our end as well.

 
**Nobunaga:**
To hell with all that!
This operation's success was pretty much all me!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Ugh, it's so hard being me... That useless man-slayers club means I have to do ten times the work!

 
**Okita:**
Whoa, those are fighting words.

 
**Okita:**
And you, Master!
Why didn't you come with us!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
All your bigheaded nonsense ends here, Big Sister!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu! You again!? What the heck!?
Is it your life's work to be an annoying obstruction!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Oh of course not. I am only doing what the true head of the Oda clan should be doing.

 
**Nobunaga:**
I see... The head of the Oda clan, you say.
I will not permit such talk, even from my own brother!

 
**Nobunaga:**
I hope you know what you're getting into.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
U-uh, ahh! No, wait...! I'm a remarkably different person this time around! Can you still be so arrogant, even in the face of THIS!?

 
**Chacha:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh no!
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Chacha!? Is she unconscious?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu... How could you stoop so low!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
And my true master is within that castle!
The Great Gold Demon Taikou, Toyotomi Hideyoshi!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Toyotomi Hideyoshi...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Is it really Monkey!?

 
**Okita:**
Wow...so sparkly...
That is a seriously garish castle...

 
**Okita:**
Wait, that's probably not what matters now...
What are you going to do with Chacha!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I shall see you at the castle, Big Sister!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Or rather, “Big Fool of Owari”!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Stop!!!

 
**Nobunaga:**
...Nobukatsu. Damn you...

 
## End Section: The Key to Victory is Shinsengumi!
 
**Hijikata:**
Now! Draw your swords and attack!
Destroy them all!

 
**Okita:**
Death to SatChou! Special attack:
Mugen Sandanzuki (AOE Noble Phantasm version)!

 
**Nobbu UFO:**
 
Nono, bubbuu!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Amazing, Shinsengumi!
 
**Hijikata:**
Quit dozing off, newbie!
Push forward until we reach their general!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Eh? AOE Noble Phantasm?
 
**Okita:**
Oh, that was just a figure of speech. Anyway, I am in top shape right now! I'm feeling so strong, I might even start shooting beams today!

 
**Okita:**
Eh? I can't? Oh dear...

 

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
How could Choushu Industries' superweapon, the Nobbu UFO, be defeated by a bunch of common, low-tech troops?

 
**Okita:**
With Master and me working together, this is a cakewalk!

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata, don't you think Master deserves a promotion to captain?

 
**Hijikata:**
Hmph...don't lose focus.
The battle's not over yet!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Wh-what the heck? That man-slayer rabble is too strong! Cannons and light beams aren't hitting them at all!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
N-no, maybe it's because of that...whatsitsname...Fujimaru?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Is [♂ he /♀ she] helping them...?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Fine. Change of plans!

 
**Chacha:**
Awww. So in the end, those dorks win... I got worried for nothing. Huh... I wonder if she took her medicine.

 
**Chacha:**
Sheesh. Leaving Chacha behind like that to go fight? Rude! Why are warriors and adults all like that?

 
**Chacha:**
Hm? Isn't that...Uncle Nobukatsu?
Where's he running off to...?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...Yes, I see... All we have to do is take out that Fujimaru [♂ guy /♀ girl]...

 
**Chacha:**
...Who is he talking to?
Shoot, I can't hear that well...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Yes, that's right. If we can take care of that, Chacha can return to our great Taikou...

 
**Chacha:**
...!? T-Taikou...!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Who's there!? ...Oh, it's you, Chacha.
You caught me in a bit of an awkward position here...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Naughty Chacha...eavesdropping...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
That's right. I was summoned to be His Highness Taikou's servant right from the beginning.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Now that you're here, I'm going to send you back to the castle.

 
**Chacha:**
Taikou... H-His Highness is in the castle!?

 
**Chacha:**
Th-that's impossible! His Highness is gone!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Oh, so you know.
Death hasn't stopped either of us, has it?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
That's because this is THAT kind of world...

 
**Chacha:**
N-no, no, no, no, no!!!

 
**Saigou Edimori:**
I've lost... I wasn't productive enough...
Next time, I will try for 36-hour workdays...

 
**Katsura Tesla:**
(Sigh) War is truly terrible. All that work,
and we even got help from Ms. Blavatsky...

 
**Hijikata:**
It's finally done. That took longer than expected. Okita! Collect the men. Shinsengumi, return!

 
**Okita:**
Understood! Thank you as well, Master! Thanks to you,
I only had three bloody coughing fits this time!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You overexerted yourself...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So that wasn't a C. Star collection skill?
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Oh? I'm surprised you were able to defeat the enemy on your own.

 
**Nobunaga:**
And you, Fujimaru!
Why didn't you back ME up!?

 
**Okita:**
That's our line! The sound of gunfire stopped halfway through the battle. What were you doing, Nobbu?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Well, you know, it started to rain,
and our matchlocks got wet...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nothing I can do about that, right?

 
**Okita:**
Sheesh... Well, now Nobbu can finally appreciate the true strength of the Shinsengumi.

 
**Okita:**
This victory doesn't belong to me alone, but to all of the Shinsengumi!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
That is enough of your ridiculous arrogance, murderers club!

 
**Hijikata:**
You are...the clown from the Oda side...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Who are you calling a clown!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Well, I suppose a lowly jumped-up farmer couldn't be expected to appreciate my noble attire!

 
**Hijikata:**
What did you say? Come, say that to my face.
Who did you call a jumped-up farmer...!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Ah-ack!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
U-uh, ahh! No, wait...! I'm a remarkably different person this time around! Can you still be so arrogant, even in the face of THIS!?

 
**Chacha:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh no!
 

 
**Okita:**
Chacha!? Is she unconscious?
Nobukatsu...why...?

 
**Okita:**
Chacha is part of your family!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu... How could you stoop so low!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
And my true master is within that castle!
The Great Gold Demon Taikou, Toyotomi Hideyoshi!

 
**Okita:**
Toyotomi Hideyoshi...?
One of the Three Unifiers of Japan?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Whoa... What the heck is that castle...? Yeah...that's definitely gaudy enough to be Monkey's castle...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Okay, that's probably not important now...
What are you going to do with Chacha!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I shall see you at the castle, Big Sister!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Or rather, “Big Fool of Owari”!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Stop!!!

 
**Nobunaga:**
...Nobukatsu. Damn you...

 
## Section 5: The Secret Emiyamaru
 
**A：???:**
Chacha...Chacha... Come back...
Come back to me...Chacha...

 
**Chacha:**
N-no! Chacha won't go back there!

 
**Chacha:**
There's nothing left there...!

 
**A：???:**
Your children are here too... Tsurumatsu and Hideyori... Come back... Everything you desire is here...

 
**Chacha:**
N-no...!

 
**Chacha:**
I don't wanna!!!

 
**Nobunaga:**
That Nobukatsu...
I never imagined he'd do something so stupid...

 
**Okita:**
I'm worried about Chacha...
Let's hurry, Master!

 
**Okita:**
...?

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata?

 
**Okita:**
What's with the scowl?
I mean, you do always look like that, but still...

 
**Hijikata:**
Demon Taikou... That voice I heard...

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata...? Hello!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's so friendly with him...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whoa, she's smacking Hijikata upside the head.
 

 
**Okita:**
Eh? Oh, Mr. Hijikata, Mr. Kondou, and I go way back.
We're like family.

 
**Okita:**
When we were young, I used to make him cry all the time!

 
**Okita:**
...So what is it, Mr. Hijikata?

 
**Hijikata:**
No...never mind.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Welcome, my elites of the Toyotomi Bakufu!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
To be able to command so many generals is something only the great Gold Demon Taikou, Lord Hideyoshi, could do!

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
Hey, I have to deal with you guys again?

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Shut up. I could say the same to you!
And why am I this Mouri character again!?

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Eh? This Mouri is completely different from the Mouri who ruled the Chugoku region? I don't care! I don't need to know inconsequential Warring States trivia!

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Hmph...the red-armored Sanada. I see that you and I are not unrelated. I do have a bit of sympathy for his story.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
His title&ndash;“The Land of the Rising Sun's greatest warrior”&ndash;may be a bit much for me, though.

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
You seem a little...overenthusiastic about this...and what's with that mask?

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Are you asking about my Rokumonsen? These are to pay the ferryman of the River Styx, which represents a Sanada warrior's resolve to&mdash;

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
I see. Thank you for that oh-sooo-interesting tidbit!
But no more useless trivia!

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
We have assembled because we heard there is a Spring Saber Annihilation Festival being held to thin out the overpopulated Sabers!

 
**Akashi Ex:**
...And I suggest we ignore anything this silly girl says. Please, pay her no mind.

 
**Akashi Ex:**
... (Nom nom)
(These Akashiyaki dumplings are delicious.)

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
I see we have two new faces!

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Oh, but that girl in the black outfit is cute.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Now then, Sun Fortress Five! I'm leaving this place in your hands! I'm off to offer Chacha to Lord Taikou!

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
...Um, are we good with this?
The little lady will die...

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
She was so cute too...
It's unfortunate, but there's nothing we can do.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Ah...we Servants have no choice but to obey the one who summons us. And that man...

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
No, but still...
Wait, more importantly, what's “Chousokabe”?

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
Hey. The enemy's here... My heart's really not in this, but I guess we don't have a choice...

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
Time to show you the fighting prowess of this so-called reincarnation of Marici!

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
...I still don't know why I'm the only one with a childhood name, but whatever...

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Hee hee... They'd better not underestimate the power of the Servants who got their animation updates!

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
When it comes to breathtakingly beautiful
☆3 Casters, I am the very best!

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Not holding back with my Hekate Graeae will be wonderful stress relief!

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
I'm not really sure about this... Huh!? I'm detecting a crudely made, overproduced, inferior unit born of mass production Saber response!

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
How come Sakura Saber gets to be a ☆5 Saber and I'm stuck as an Assass&ndash;(Cough, cough)

 
**Akashi Ex:**
(Huff, huff) (This shiruko is good, too.) Japanese sweets are wonderful... They fill my heart with sugary goodness.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Hm...the enemy is coming from the front, while the castle that we must protect is behind us. We all know what to do.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Hey everyone. Back away a bit.
I'm doing this&mdash;

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
...I am the bone of my sword.

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
Hey, what the hell are you doing!? Whoa!

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
Th-this power...!?

 
**Nobunaga:**
The more I look at it, the more absurdly overwrought this castle looks! As their former boss, I am embarrassed for them! They lack wabi! They lack saaabiii!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Even the great Rikyu is spinning in his grave.

 
**Okita:**
We've almost reached the Sun Fortress, or whatever it's called. That's where they're keeping Chacha.

 
**Okita:**
Fortunately, it's situated on level terrain. Easy to attack, difficult to defend. This will be an easy win, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, actually...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that...
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm? What's that sound? An earthquake?

 
**Okita:**
Ehhhhhh!? Th-that's!?

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
This is Sanada's pride and joy: Super Fortress...

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
...Emiyamaru!

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
I have no intention of losing!

 
**Nobunaga:**
What the actual hell is that!? Well, taking the castle's position into consideration, the fort's placement is tactically sound...

 
**Nobunaga:**
That red-masked weirdo...
He's not one to be taken lightly!

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Ha. Such praise from the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven is an honor!

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Eh? Don't tell me you're a Warring States buff?

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
No, but the Heroic Spirit that has fused with me is shouting within me. Shouting that I must protect that castle.

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
Yeah, I actually agree with you. I wonder why... This feeling... It's not really regret... It's almost like a sense of pride bubbling up...

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
I hate things like that! Things like pride and romanticizing warfare... Men are so dumb!

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Although... Was I Mouri Medinaga?
I do feel like I need to try my best here for some reason.

 
**Okita:**
Mouri? Does that mean you're Choushu...?

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Oh! Are we doing that bit now!?

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
No, I may be Mouri, but apparently I'm not THAT Mouri! Honestly, I don't really know the details.

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
...Hee hee... This place will be the death of you!

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
The amazing Warring States Space Battlemaiden, Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X, shall punish the counterfeit Saber!

 
**Okita:**
Chousokabe...? Which means...Tosa...?

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
Eh? Is that not my style? Am I not someone who says stuff like “KILL SABER” and that kinda thing?

 
**Akashi Ex:**
...X...just stop.

 
**Okita:**
It doesn't matter! SatChou and Tosa must die!
There will be no mercy!

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
I'm so glad we get to stay out of this for a change.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Uh, I'm not sure if that's true.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Anyway, you will all experience the true terror...

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
...of my Emiyamaru!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
...Sheesh. This went just like last time...

 
**Gotou Sétanta:**
Oh, well. Nothing for it. Hey, next time can I at least go by something other than my childhood name?

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
Eh? Some say that it was Mouri, not Sanada, who was the true master of strategy in the Osaka battle?

 
**Mouri Medinaga:**
I said I don't care!

 
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**
I can't believe some phony Saber defeated my Meteor Sword... It was all because we didn't make any decisions...

 
**Akashi Ex:**
For my payment of Japanese sweets, I think I did good... (Nom nom) (Maybe I'll try out okonomiyaki on my way back?)

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
Heh... I knew this would happen.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
I suppose we lost because I compromised the citadel's walls by driving spears through them to look cool...

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
...Hurry. You are the only ones who can save that girl.

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
It seems the Heroic Spirit who has fused with me also wants that.

 
**Okita:**
Sanada Emimura&ndash;no, Sanada Yukimura&ndash;is Chacha's...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Eh? Who is this guy? Is he famous? Sanada?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Oh, Sanada, the former retainer of Takeda? Now that you mention it, I think he left me his horse right before I died...

 
**Nobunaga:**
I don't remember much but... Eh? His son?

 
**Sanada Emimura:**
You've messed everything up. It's your fault that I had to go through hell... That's what the Heroic Spirit within me seems to think...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was a tough battle...in many ways!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sanada Emimura... “Greatest warrior” indeed.
 

 
**Okita:**
A-anyway, all that's left is that Sun Fortress!
Let's hurry, Master!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Sheesh... The Sun Fortress Five wasn't good for anything except buying a little time. Now I have to deal with Big Sister and the Shinsengumi...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
No, wait! The real threat is you, Fujimaru! You're the one who unified the two groups!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu! How dare you continue to scurry around causing mischief!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Hah! Unfortunately for you, the stalling was effective! Chacha has already been sacrificed and the Great Gold Demon Taikou has revived!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Now, behold! The paradise of death!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Radiant Demon Fortress of the Sun!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Wh-what the...? Is space shifting?

 
**Okita:**
...Wh-what's going on!?

 
## Section 6: GUDAGUDA Final Battle, Fortress of the Sun
 
**Nobunaga:**
Is there...a huge amount of magical energy pouring out of Monkey's castle?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Whoa!? That tasteless, shiny castle is getting even worse!

 
**Okita:**
Wh-what is going on?

 
**Hijikata:**
We saw this last time... Which means...

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, we figured it out!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash!? Eh? Are you calling from Chaldea?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, when did you...!?
 

 
**Mash:**
There were a few things I wanted to look into, so I returned to Chaldea to analyze them with Da Vinci.

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry to have left you without telling you.
But please forgive me, in the Guda Guda way...!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Explain later!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Let me get right to the point! There is a Demon God Pillar at the core of that demonic castle!

 
**Nobunaga:**
A Demon God Pillar!?
Weren't those things completely destroyed?

 
**Okita:**
As in THOSE Demon God Pillars!?
What does that mean...?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Do you know why, Da Vinci!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Thanks for that to-be-expected reaction.
Of course, I am a genius, after all.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So what is there, to be blunt,
is the corpse of a Demon God Pillar.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Specifically, the carcass of the Demon God Pillar that died in that Singularity somehow ended up there, and somehow carved that space out of time itself.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Or maybe it fled while it was near death, and ultimately made it there.

 
**Mash:**
Whichever the case, we haven't been able to determine why it meddled with space-time there.

 
**Mash:**
We do know that it is somewhat different than the ones we encountered before, so please be careful, Senpai!

 
**Gold Demon Taikou Hideyoshi:**
I am Hideyoshi, the Gold Demon Taikou!
An eternal golden paradise shall be created here!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...Do you see, Big Sister!? A new almighty savior has been born from the Demon God Pillar's remnants!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
And within this space, the Great Gold Demon Taikou is going to grant the blessing of eternity to mortals everywhere, and so save them all!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Big Sister, this will allow you to be free of the obligations that come with being an Oda, and you can go back to the carefree life you lived before!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu... Did you...do all this for me...?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Why, of course!
Nobukatsu always has Big Sister's back!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Those dumb chief retainers of the Oda clan knew nothing!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Not acknowledging Big Sister because you were a woman!? Unforgivable! That's why I did all of this!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
And as a result, you purged them all, and they became...that!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
You're brilliant! You were the obvious successor of the Oda clan! There is no way I could have fulfilled that role!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...Because I was incompetent!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu...

 
**Okita:**
Nobukatsu...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Now, everyone must die, and then eternity will be all that remains. The bonds of the Oda will be pointless!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
There will be no need to think of the future!
You just have to retain your current happiness!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
If you don't eliminate neighboring states, your own state will be destroyed... We're forced to fight needless battles just for the sake of territory!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
There's no need to return to that crazy era anymore!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Big Sister! Let us stay in this enclosed space and live our carefree childhood lives forever!

 
**Hijikata:**
...

 
**Nobunaga:**
...I'm sorry, Nobukatsu.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...Eh?

 
**Nobunaga:**
I drove you into a corner that time...

 
**Nobunaga:**
If only I had made a decision sooner, I could have sent you to a temple where you may not have lost your life.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Wh-why...why are you apologizing? There should have been no question that the only one worthy to take over leadership of the clan was you, gifted as you are.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Father forced everything upon you! He is to blame!
This is how it should be, Big Sister! You can be free now!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Guess it can't be helped!
Nobukatsu, I'm gonna have to put you in the ground.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...What do you mean? I am trying to create a world where we can enjoy our lives like in our childhood...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I guess I have no choice but to convince Big Sister of the value of what I'm doing...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
You can reflect on that while you're crushed in wave after wave of infinite carcasses! We have all the time we need!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Sorry, Fujimaru, would you do something about all these flunkies?

 
**Nobunaga:**
I'm gonna deal with my little brother personally.

 
**Okita:**
Hey! Wait! Don't forget about me!

 
**Okita:**
Whatever weirdness you're up to is none of my business, Nobbu. But maybe we can still save Chacha!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Idiot... Hey, Hijikata of the Shinsengumi, was it?
I'll leave you in charge here. You can handle this, right?

 
**Hijikata:**
...Hmph, shut your trap. You talk too much. No matter who we face, if they stand in the way of the Shinsengumi...

 
**Hijikata:**
...we will cut them to ribbons!

 
**Nobunaga:**
No matter what the opponent, huh? Fine!
I'm counting on you, Fujimaru!

 
**Nobunaga:**
To hell with an eternal world for the Toyotomi Bakufu! Foolish! Listen up, Nobukatsu!

 
**Nobunaga:**
A man's life is but fifty years...
It is but a dream... in the great order of things.

 
**Nobunaga:**
What makes humans so awesome is that they shine brilliantly in their short lives! Burn this image into your eyes, and your mind!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Bear witness to how Oda Nobunaga, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, lives!

 
## Section 7: Farewell, Loving GUDAGUDA World
 
**Nobunaga:**
...We're finally here.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Ugh, they didn't hold back when it came to making more Mini Nobus.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...I guess I was no match for Big Sister...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Why must I always fail so hard...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I'm so bad, sometimes I question whether I'm really related to Big Sister.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hey, don't say that. If there's anything to blame, it's the era we lived in. It's nobody's fault. It was just the times!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I suppose...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
But I will accept any punishment Big Sister has for me.
It is only right. Just do it quickly. I don't like pain...

 
**Nobunaga:**
...Very well. Goodbye, Nobukatsu.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait a minute!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stay, Nobbu!
 

 
**Okita:**
Nobbu...!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Eh? Huh?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...Big Sister?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Geez. I really am a softie when it comes to family.
Just who I am, I guess.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nobbu...I knew you'd do the right thing.
 

 
**Nobukatsu:**
BIIIIIIG SIIISSSTEEERRR...!
I...I...! (Cling)

 
**Nobunaga:**
Arrgh! Don't touch me! That's disgusting!
Besides, we still have another boss fight to deal with!

 
**Okita:**
Oh yes... The remains of the Demon God Pillar&ndash;or rather, the Gold Demon Taikou!

 
**Gold Demon Taikou Hideyoshi:**
I am Hideyoshi, the Gold Demon Taikou...!
I offer eternal life...!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Shut up, demon trash! And come on, Chacha!
Take off that mask and wake up already!

 
**Nobunaga:**
You and I share the same noble Oda blood! No Oda could ever die so easily! This shouldn't phase you at all!

 
**Chacha:**
...A-Auntie?

 
**Okita:**
Chacha! What a relief!
She hasn't been completely consumed!

 
**Chacha:**
N-no, you don't understand, Auntie. This is all Chacha's fault. His Highness, Tsurumatsu, Hideyori...

 
**Chacha:**
Those who had tried to protect the Toyotomi family...

 
**Chacha:**
They are all blaming Chacha... Calling me the woman who destroyed Toyotomi... A horrible, wicked woman...! The obsession of a deranged Toyotomi!

 
**Chacha:**
Those words are boiling up from within me...
Just like that day...forever and ever!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Ah, so that's what Monkey thinks...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Listen, Chacha. I know Monkey very well. He was naive yet calculating, emotional yet unequivocal, and truly coldhearted.

 
**Nobunaga:**
A man who was unquestionably two-faced, and yet he shone with glory. He was a man like the sun itself.

 
**Nobunaga:**
It was only natural for him to succeed me as ruler.

 
**Nobunaga:**
But there is one thing he couldn't do!
And Chacha, you know very well what that is.

 
**Nobunaga:**
And that is:

 
**Nobunaga:**
He couldn't say no to the woman he fell for!

 
**Chacha:**
Auntie...

 
**Chacha:**
Th-that's right! His Highness was always kind to Chacha! Always and only to Chacha!

 
**Chacha:**
So that voice I hear coming from the pillar is...!?

 
**Gold Demon Taikou Hideyoshi:**
Why... Why do you refuse... Toyotomi... Your children... They can live on forever...

 
**Nobunaga:**
And now our eyes are open to the tru&ndash;AHHH SO MANY EYES!!!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Whatever. It's just a stupid jerk that tried to deceive and devour Chacha.

 
**Okita:**
Huh, what do you mean?

 
**Nobunaga:**
That thing really is the carcass of a Demon God Pillar.

 
**Nobunaga:**
During the battle with Solomon, it must have developed some self-awareness.

 
**Nobunaga:**
What happens when a living thing becomes aware of itself? Naturally, it begins to fear its eventual demise.

 
**Nobunaga:**
While the other Demon God Pillars stayed on the battlefield following orders, this one fled its post... Because it wanted to live.

 
**Nobunaga:**
However, weak as it was, it was unable to stave off death. And so it drew it last breath&ndash;here. Now, only its vindictive desires remain.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Wait, YOU figured this all out? I mean, you're right... That's basically the residual thought patterns of a Demon God Pillar that took shape.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It may just be a corpse that drifted here, but it's still a Demon God Pillar. Even that shell is a powerful magical tool.

 
**Da Vinci:**
The Demon God Pillar resonated with the powerful desire not to die, then fused with that very desire and materialized as something similar to a Grail.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It's like a nasty parasite. It can't maintain its existence without using the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit as a catalyst.

 
**Mash:**
So if we separate Chacha from it,
this realm will go back to normal!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Da Vinci, yes!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you, too, Mash!
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Let's put an end to this, Fujimaru!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Chacha, we'll get you out of that piece of trash soon!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just hang in there, okay?
 

 
**Chacha:**
Auntie... Fujimaru...

 
**Chacha:**
Okay! Chacha will wait!

 
**Chacha:**
Let. Go. Of. Chacha! Lemmego!

 
**Chacha:**
Oh, right! Chacha can shoot fire from her hands.
Wanna get burned?

 
**Hijikata:**
...Good. Sounds like the chitchat's done with.

 
**Hijikata:**
All we have to do is slice it up, right?

 
**Hijikata:**
THEN LET'S GET TO IT!!!

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata... It's always like this with you...

 
**Okita:**
Anyway, let's end this!

 
**Okita:**
To be honest, I'm running kinda low on HP myself...

 
**Okita:**
(Cough!?)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, everyone! Final boss battle time!
 
**Okita:**
Come, to the decisive battle!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Oda and Shinsengumi working together...We are the O-Shin Alliance!
 
**Nobunaga:**
Hm! It's gonna get a taste of our powers combined!

 

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
I...I don't want to die... I don't want to die...
I don't want to die here...like this...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
I just want to keep living...somewhere...
Alone in my own world...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
I don't need purpose. No ideals or conviction.
No subjugation or rule. No pursuit or development. No camaraderie or parting... None of it.

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
I just...wanted to relish this newfound sense of self...a bit longer.

 
**Chacha:**
Hm? Where am I...?

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha remembers getting enveloped in flames that day...

 
**Chacha:**
I see. So this is what hell's like...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
I don't want to die... I don't want to die...

 
**Chacha:**
Wh-what are you!? A D-Demon God Pillar!?
D-don't come near Chacha...!

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
Chacha...? This record... You destroyed Toyotomi...?
I see... You're going to die too...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
I will die soon... And so I...I understand how you feel. Give me your hand... If I fuse myself with you, then we'll...!

 
**Chacha:**
S-stop! Ch-Chacha is not the one who destroyed Toyotomi!

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha tried to save Hideyori...!

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
Ah...you were branded a liar, and a woman who brought destruction in later history... You are a fitting vessel for me to inhabit...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
O woman who denies destruction, as one who turns her back on it, you are truly fitting as my accomplice.

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
O infernal princess, your powerful sense of shame was the beacon that guided me through the sea of death.

 
**Chacha:**
N-no! Chacha isn't a destroyer! Or an infernal anything!

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha...Chacha just...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
...Disappear... She will disappear... The woman who rejected destruction will never accept eternity.

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
...I do not understand humans.
Life is incomprehensible. But...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
One thing has become clear to me. Biological activity without purpose is no true voyage; it is merely drifting...

 
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**
...And I...simply failed to properly order my goals and purposes in this brief existence...

 
**Chacha:**
Th-that was a close one, Fujimaru!

 
**Chacha:**
Good work saving Chacha!
Make Auntie give you a reward!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Cut the crap.

 
**Nobunaga:**
We wouldn't even BE in this mess if you hadn't gotten yourself captured by that Demon God Pillar...

 
**Okita:**
Now, now. All's well that ends well.
We should be happy that everyone's safe and sound.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Well, Big Sister, I think this is goodbye...

 
**Okita:**
Huh? Nobukatsu!? Why are you fading away!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Well, you know, I'm pretty insignificant,
so I don't exactly qualify as a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
It was only thanks to the Demon God Pillar that I was able to maintain my Spirit Origin.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
You all went to great lengths to save me,
but I think this is the end.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Nobukatsu...

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Oh come on, Big Sis.
I am not the sort of brother who should be missed.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
I'm the dumb little brother whose jealousy of his amazing Big Sister started this whole insurrection.

 
**Nobunaga:**
I see... You're right...

 
**Nobunaga:**
Okay, bye then!

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Oh come on! I'm disappearing forever and THAT'S the best you can manage!?

 
**Nobukatsu:**
Ah, Big Sister. Just one last thing.

 
**Nobunaga:**
...What is it? Come on, spit it out.

 
**Nobukatsu:**
...I leave THE REST to you, Big Sister.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Wh-what!? Don't give me that crap, you dummy!
Who uses the same last words TWICE!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nobbu...
 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry to cut into this...“touching” moment, but...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...the Demon God Pillar that created this realm has disappeared. We'd better get you all out of there.

 
**Mash:**
That's right! Please hurry, Senpai!
If you stay there, like last time, the space will...

 
**Mash:**
Oh? It's not collapsing...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Eh? You're right. Why's that? Could there still be a shard of the Demon God Pillar somewhere?

 
**Chacha:**
Eh!? Does Chacha still have a chunk of that weirdo thing on her, Fujimaru?

 
**Nobunaga:**
...No, that's not it.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Right, Shinsengumi!?

 
**Hijikata:**
...Hmph. Seems that way.

 
**Okita:**
Eh? M-Mr. Hiji...kata...!?

 
## Epilogue: Shinsengumi
 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata... Why...?

 
**Nobunaga:**
It's simple. That Hijikata Toshizo guy is also a Heroic Spirit that the Demon God Pillar summoned.

 
**Nobunaga:**
...Am I right?

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
...After hearing your conversation, it seems that way.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
On that fateful day, I was shot at Hakodate...and the next thing I knew, I was here. Does that mean the Demon God Pillar consumed me, too?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Not necessarily. That thing called out for those who share its desires, and maintained this space.

 
**Nobunaga:**
You're just one of the keystones that made this space, all the while being a Rogue Servant who didn't need the power of the Demon God Pillar.

 
**Nobunaga:**
If it had consumed you, I'm sure this place would have been a much more hellish battlefield.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Anyway! Your version of immortality doesn't seem to quite match up with the Demon God Pillar's.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Isn't that right, Hijikata? You're the epitome of stubborn refusal to back down. Besides, you're not the kind of wuss who'd let someone else control your Spirit Origin.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Heh. I suppose I should be honored to get a seal of approval from the lord of the Sengoku period.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Oh hey. Now that I've got a good look at you,
I can see you're quite a beauty.

 
**Okita:**
This is no time to joke around!

 
**Okita:**
Actually, if we can just talk Mr. Hijikata down, this'll sort itself out, and he'll come back to his senses, right?

 
**Nobunaga:**
That's not possible. Even the Demon God Pillar couldn't release the man from madness.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Hey, Hijikata... You didn't even realize you turned into a Heroic Spirit after you died, did you?

 
**Nobunaga:**
You wandered that strange battlefield, all that time projecting your desires toward the Grail&ndash;toward the Demon God Pillar.

 
**Nobunaga:**
The whole time, all you were thinking was:
“I can't die here. I won't be killed until I win.”

 
**Da Vinci:**
Probably. The Grail grants people's wishes. As the one who wished on it, his desire was what shaped that realm.

 
**Okita:**
That can't be... Does that mean Mr. Hijikata intended to continue living, to embody the Shinsengumi forever...?

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
I get it now... There was something...odd that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Now it's all clear.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
...In other words...

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
You're all trapped here until I die.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Am I right, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven?

 
**Nobunaga:**
...Yeah.

 
**Nobunaga:**
So what are you going to do, Okita?
If it's too hard for you, I can do it...

 
**Okita:**
Please be quiet, Nobbu!

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata! Why!?
Do you not realize that you've died!?

 
**Okita:**
That's not right! Because...
Because the Shinsengumi's already&mdash;

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Shut up, Okita!!!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Listen to me! The Shinsengumi will never end...

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Kondou...Nagakura...Saitou...
In the end, they were all gone.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
...But don't worry.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Me... As long as I'm around,
the Shinsengumi will never end...

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Right here...!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
I am...!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
...THE SHINSENGUMI!

 
**Okita:**
No...!

 
**Okita:**
You're... You're wrong...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, THIS is Okita's Shinsengumi...! Here with us!
 

 
**Okita:**
Master!?

 
**Okita:**
Wh-what do you mean...?

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Well, well... You've got guts, newbie.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Or rather, Fujimaru!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
You stand here, before ME, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi, Hijikata Toshizo...

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
...and YOU dare to tell ME where the Shinsengumi is!?

 
**Okita:**
Master...!

 
**Okita:**
That's right...!
Right now, I am Master's sword!

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata!

 
**Okita:**
My makoto&ndash;my sincerity&ndash;is right here!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Hey Okita, for someone who quit because she was sick, you're talking awfully big now.

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
So be it. If you're ready to live and die by that belief, then rest assured, you'll have no mercy from me!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Your banner or my Shinsengumi... We're going to decide which is the real Shinsengumi right here!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
Let's go!

 
**Hijikata Toshizo:**
SHINSENGUMI, ADVANCE!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Okita:**
... (Pant, pant, pant)

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
...Your sword is still as deadly as ever.

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
Ever since we were kids, I've always known the power of your sword...

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata...! I... I...!

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
I see... So, you've planted your banner at [♂ his /♀ her] side, then...

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
But no matter what happens...

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
...my Shinsengumi...will NEVER die!

 
**Okita:**
...!

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
I'll be seeing you, Okita...

 
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**
You keep that makoto banner of yours flying high, Okita. Always.

 
**Nobunaga:**
Sheesh. He didn't change one bit; not even at the end. Guy had some serious conviction, especially for a Berserker.

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata...

 
**Okita:**
Eh!?

 
**Okita:**
Wait a minute! Mr. Hijikata was a Berserker?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh? You didn't notice?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, that was pretty convincing.
 

 
**Okita:**
What? No! He was definitely a Saber, or even an Archer, right!? What kind of group would the Shinsengumi be if the vice commander were a Berserker!? Huh!?

 
**Chacha:**
Hellooo! Chacha's being completely left out of the loop! Don't you think that's bad? BAD???

 
**Chacha:**
No matter how you look at it, Chacha's obviously the real heroine here. So...really!?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, now that Hijikata has been defeated, the space around you is starting to collapse! Get back to Chaldea now!

 
**Nobunaga:**
Oh, I forgot! Everyone, follow me! If we all get back safe and sound, we'll have a barbecue at the temple!

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha wants to see Auntie's strange Atsumori play!

 
**Chacha:**
It's creepy, but Chacha loves it!!

 
**Okita:**
...

 
**Okita:**
...Mr. Hijikata...

 
**Okita:**
As long as my banner is still here...

 
**Okita:**
I'll... I'll keep on fighting!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go...!
 

 
**Okita:**
Yes, Master!

 
**Hijikata:**
...Well... I guess there's nothing left.

 
**Hijikata:**
I can't hear the sounds of the battlefield.
I can't even see the road that leads back to Hakodate.

 
**Hijikata:**
Damn. That idiot Okita claims I died...

 
**Hijikata:**
...I see. So it's true; I did die...

 
**Hijikata:**
I took off my haori, picked up a gun, and just...fought.

 
**Hijikata:**
But in the end, I was driven to the far north...and wound up like this.

 
**Hijikata:**
Pathetic. This feeling makes my stomach churn with rage so much, it feels like it might even be able to bring me back to life.

 
**Hijikata:**
I haven't failed my makoto, yet my body has failed me.
And that is...infuriating.

 
**Hijikata:**
...But not half as much as the fact that Okita,
idiot that she is, defeated me...

 
**Hijikata:**
Well, yeah...

 
**Hijikata:**
The stupid girl, who sat on the veranda that day just staring absently up at the sky, acts like such a big shot now.

 
**Hijikata:**
That's just how I remember her from Kondou's dojo... The girl we all laughed about because none of us ever thought we could beat her.

 
**Hijikata:**
I'm glad I could see her like that again.
Might as well steel myself and go... Hm?

 
**Demon God Andras:**
...Are you still here? This space is collapsing.
You should leave before you get stuck.

 
**Hijikata:**
You're a Demon God Pillar, right? I would have expected you to try and drag me down with you. But...are you concerned about me?

 
**Hijikata:**
If only I'd been more compatible with you, this world would've been better fortified and defended.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
Correct. That's nothing more than a regret now, though. But thanks to you, I did learn one thing.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
To die while lamenting the life that has been lost...

 
**Demon God Andras:**
That was the one saving grace I received as I gained self-awareness.

 
**Hijikata:**
...

 
**Demon God Andras:**
But you are different.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
I will disappear at the end of my drifting, while you will disappear at the end of your battle.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
That is the fate that was engraved onto your Spirit Origin. And so, it is not yet time for you to die.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
My beacon. My horizon. O Berserker soldier who witnessed the end of my drifting.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
Keep fighting. Fight for the sake of your makoto,
even though you know you cannot be saved.

 
**Demon God Andras:**
This shall be your punishment for redeeming my evil, even for a brief moment, and my final wish made in this life.

 
**Hijikata:**
...Hmph.

 
**Hijikata:**
...There's no need to point it out. No matter how much I get beaten down, I'm the sort of stubborn ox who will keep fighting until I win.

 
**Hijikata:**
I'm aware that the Shinsengumi may never win in history. I remained a Wolf of Mibu until the very end.

 
**Hijikata:**
But my&ndash;no, the Shinsengumi's&ndash;makoto will never fall. No matter what battlefield we find ourselves on, no matter what kind of hell it's in.

 
**Hijikata:**
...Fine. Dead or alive, I'll show them what it means to be a Berserker.

 
**Hijikata:**
Should a voice ever call out to me in a summoning,
I'll charge in and roar with all my might!

 
**Mash:**
You went through a lot this time around, Senpai.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. That was even worse than last time.
 

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, let's take a break until our next assignment. Why don't I make you some tea since we have a bit of time?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice. Let's have that food we got from Kyoto too.
 

 
**Mash:**
Wh-what is this...!?

 
**Chacha:**
Oh hey! Why, if it isn't Fujimaru!

 
**Chacha:**
Plain and boring rooms are not Chacha's style, so I tried reproducing that golden tea room from the other day. Chacha did good, huh?

 
**Nobunaga:**
Well...this is no good.
Needs more wabi-sabi.

 
**Mash:**
No, that's not what I mean...! First of all, why is everyone messing around in Master's room!?

 
**Okita:**
Well you see, I used up all my NP during our last battle...

 
**Okita:**
I can't go anywhere for a while, so please let me recuperate in Master's room.

 
**Okita:**
Oh, if you're going to be making tea, go light, please.
And some sweets would be nice.

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha too! Chacha too! U-um, cups, cups, cups...

 
**Chacha:**
Well, I guess this thing I stole from the Demon God Pillar right before we left might work...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh? Isn't that a Grail?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good work...!
 

 
**Chacha:**
What? You can have it if you want it.

 
**Chacha:**
That cup is not Chacha's style anyway.

 
**Chacha:**
So! Fujimaru! Now that Chacha's at this Chaldea place, you'll never be bored!

 
**Chacha:**
Now you have luxurious barbecued meals with Chacha every day to look forward to!

 
**Chacha:**
You're already looking forward to it, right? Right!?

 
**Chacha:**
...Sooo! Mash, or whoever you're supposedta be! Chacha is already bored! Entertain Chacha! Do something fun!

 
**Chacha:**
Vee-are? I hear there's something called Vee-are?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Please say something!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right...um...
 

 
**Nobunaga:**
Well, it can't be helped!
