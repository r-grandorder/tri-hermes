# Prisma Codes

## Prelude
 
**???:**
Hey, we can be friends forever and ever and ever and ever, right? Right?

 
**???:**
...Idiot. Are you stupid?

 
**???:**
You screamed, “I'm done with you!” at me yesterday. Did you already forget?

 
**???:**
Um, I forgot. Besides, it's okay!

 
**???:**
Magic. We have magic!
We are magical girls after all!

 
**???:**
Magical...girl? You call yourself that?
What's that? Don't you mean a witch?

 
**???:**
Don't you think it's embarrassing to admit your own immaturity? That's just a failure. Besides...

 
**???:**
I-I don't have any talent for magic...
I can read some spell tomes, but that's about it...

 
**???:**
Hey, what are you talking about? That's plenty talented! I can never do what you do! I get stuck right away!

 
**???:**
Don't write yourself off so quickly! You're such an idiot... Don't give up before you even start...

 
**???:**
If you want to use magic properly, you should start by studying runes&mdash;

 
**???:**
Study...? Oh, sorry, sorry. I'll try my best.

 
**???:**
What am I to do with you...

 
**???:**
Senpai. Senpai.
Get a hold of yourself.

 
**???:**
This is not the time to be sleeping. If you don't get up...
I will (censored) you. Is that okay with you?

 
**???:**
To do that, I must muster up all the courage in my body and put everything I have into it. There's no other way.

 
**???:**
Is that really okay?
I'm really going to (censored) you.

That's scary. I should get up.
 
**Mash:**
Good morning. A wonderful awakening, that's the Senpai I know.

 
**Mash:**
From the way you sleep to the way you rise up like a submarine making an emergency ascent...

 
**Mash:**
You have grown so much. I can't slack off anymore.

 
**Mash:**
I guess I have to ask Kiyohime to teach me the Hot Fire Wake Up Time technique next time.

Zzz... (Show me what you've got.)
 
**???:**
Hm? You're actually awake, aren't you, Senpai?

 
**???:**
When you sleep, your ears move back and forth like when Fou is dreaming, so I can tell.

 
**???:**
...Senpai?

 
**???:**
That was just a little joke. There is no point training your facial muscles now.

 
**???:**
In some way, I respect you for putting efforts in such trivial matters... But right now I need you to focus that effort somewhere else.

 
**Mash:**
...There you go. Finally.

**Mash:**
It seems like another unexpected Rayshift.
Although it seems like just... the two of us.

 
**Mash:**
I've never seen such a place before.

Yes. We've visited many different eras in world history, but this time I can't even tell if it's Earth or not...

This is like a different world. I feel uneasy.

Let's take a look around.
 
**Mash:**
I agree. Let's explore with caution.

 
**Mash:**
Never mind the Servants.
I'm concerned if Fou might have been involved.

I already tried... But I am not getting any response...

 
**Mash:**
Do they realize that we've disappeared from Chaldea? Even so...

**B：???:**
Aaaaah!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I hear something over there. Could it be Fou?
...No, it sounded more cheerful...

 
**B：???:**
Aaaaah! Move out of the way!

 
**Mash:**
Master, watch out!!

 
**Mash:**
Ouch!

I'm being chased by a very scary person!
We were fighting and I got blown sky-high!

Fighting!? This place seems so peaceful, yet there are enemies here? ...And who exactly are you, anyway?

Ooooh, you want to know, hmm?
Are you infatuated by my devilish charm?

...Wait!

Oh my, it's just the stick.
You're still alive?

Wow, another new guest? But...this Master and its familiar seem pretty boring.

**C：???:**
Oh, you know who I am? That makes me a little happy. But you're a little off the mark.

 
**Mash:**
It's true... Something feels off about her.
That tiara seems more sparkly than usual...

 


---
 
**C：???:**
Fine, I shall tell you the name of the queen who will be ruling you from today.

 
**C：???:**
I'll say it only once, so listen carefully. If I have to repeat myself, I'll feed you to my guard dog♡

Men's hopes of servitude and dreams of enslavement are my energy source! I'm the greatest magical girl of all!

**Medb:**
Girl! Magical Girl! Why are you being so specific?

 
**Medb:**
Sure, I know I barely qualify as a girl anymore.
But just go along with it, okay!?

 


---
 
**Medb:**
ANYWAY! My chariot brought me here with a spectacular entrance as ever.

 
**Medb:**
Nowadays I'm the queen who rules the Land of Snow and Honey. That's me. Got it?

 
**Medb:**
Now, hand me that magical stick&ndash; “Ruby” or whatever it was&ndash;right this minute!

Nooooo! There is only one Master to whom I have sworn my heart!

I will never be yours!

**Ruby:**
Umm, it's hard for me to judge those things.

 
**Ruby:**
But her “it's my land, so anything goes” attitude really makes me mad!

 
**Ruby:**
If you were my Master, I wouldn't allow it!
You'd get a punishment BIG TIME!

**Ruby:**
Whoa, is it confession time already?

 
**Ruby:**
...She's a very normal girl!

 
**Ruby:**
But she can be crazy strong sometimes!
Oh, and she's compassionate! And hardworking!

 
**Ruby:**
...I suppose like any other girl she gets swayed easily once her desire switch kicks in, but still...

 
**Ruby:**
Kind of scary, huh, how even the brightest among us can become rampaging monsters... Wouldn't you agree?

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai? Why are you staring at me? Are you trying to make eye contact?

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, let's prepare for battle!
Focus on the monster in front of us for now!

Yes, Master!

 
**Medb:**
Oh, are you pigs challenging me?
Fine, I'll make you squeal.

 
**Medb:**
Go, Reindeer Man! Snowman! Let's show them the Land of Snow and Honey's power!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Medb:**
Oh, we lost? Really.
You guys are pretty strong.

 
**Medb:**
In this neutral zone, it seems my soldiers can't fight at 100%. Lesson learned.

 
**Medb:**
But the games have just begun, piggies.

 
**Medb:**
I am Queen Medb. I can create as many soldiers as I want.

Hehe. I know you want to touch me, but hold off on those measly hits, okay?

I told you it's useless. It looks like you don't understand the rules yet.

But this is nice, very nice. I like that desperate expression, the aura of an underdog!

I thought you might be a good snack for Mini Cú, but perhaps I should eat you instead?

But... if we retreat now, we'll be captured by Queen Medb!

Something tells me that won't turn out well, so...
I won't... give up so easily!

**Ruby:**
Sorry for all the trouble! I'm zipping right on over!

Hmm...

 
**Medb:**
She's not broken despite getting run over by my chariot. This new Magical Girl is quite feisty!

 
**Medb:**
You, tell me your name! I may invite you into my invincible army!

 
**???:**
Ugh, spouting nonsense again...

 
**Illya:**
My... My name is Illyasviel von Einzbern!

 
**Illya:**
I don't care about your invincible army!
Just give me back Miyu!

 
**Illya:**
Miyu is my... my very best friend!

 
**Illya:**
Ruby! Transform!

Certainly!

Kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya has arrived!

 
**Medb:**
Sorry, ignore my previous invitation. What is with that transformation? It's getting on my nerves.

 
**Medb:**
We don't need more of you here.
You're an eyesore, so I'll kill you for real.

 
**Illya:**
I wasn't ready before, that's all!
This time you won't have it so easy!

 
**Illya:**
Schneiden!

 
**Medb:**
You little brat...

 
**Mash:**
Wow... It's working! Her attacks are getting through to Medb, Master!

 
**Ruby:**
Her movement has slowed down!
Now's your chance!

 
**Illya:**
Yup, leave it to me!
Maximum convergence...

 
**Illya:**
Feuer!!

 
**Medb:**
You're such a brat, I tell you!
Don't you dare get carried awa&mdash;

 
**Medb:**
Mini Cú!?

 
**Illya:**
He took the blow for her!?

 
**Ruby:**
I'm guessing you must be her familiar?

 
**Mini Cú:**
Hey, Medb. You're getting carried away in someone else's kingdom.

 
**Mini Cú:**
If you're gonna go crazy on other people's turf, make sure you're prepared. Your magical barrier is full of holes already, idiot.

 
**Mini Cú:**
It's good you want to crush them. They're your enemies. However, only an idiot would drag on a fight on someone else's turf.

 
**Mini Cú:**
If you're gonna do it, do it quick. If you fail, return right away. That's basic stuff. Basic.

 
**Medb:**
Mini Cú...!
That advice is so flawless!

 
**Medb:**
But this is different!

 
**Medb:**
Don't you think this the perfect opportunity to show everyone how a magical girl's familiar should act? By sacrificing yourself in the most honorable way?

 
**Mini Cú:**
Shut up, don't make me throw codfish and cheese snacks at you. C'mon, we're leaving.

 
**Medb:**
Oh Mini Cú, kill me! I love you!

 
**Mash:**
Queen Medb and her mysterious familiar have withdrawn. A very bold retreat...

 
**Illya:**
Miyu... I need to save Miyu!
...What!?

 
**Illya:**
The transformation wore off!? What are you doing, Ruby!? I can't go after that person like this!

 
**Ruby:**
Huh? For some reason the magical energy feed isn't stabilizing...

 
**Ruby:**
The reception seems strangely poor... Hmm...

 
**Ruby:**
Well, if you just walk around, maybe you'll get a bar soon.

 
**Illya:**
Like a cell phone!?

 
**Illya:**
I'm Illyasviel von Einzbern. I am a 5th year student at Homurahara Academy Elementary School.

 
**Illya:**
A-And, uh, I'm... I'm a... I've been forced into the role of a... a m-magical girl...

 
**Illya:**
Ahhh! This is really embarrassing when you say it aloud!

 
**Illya:**
Um, thank you so much for finding and protecting Ruby! (Bowing)

 
**Illya:**
Um, Ms. Kyrielight?

 
**Mash:**
Please call me Mash, Miss Einzbern.

 
**Illya:**
Oh, me too then! Call me Illya!

**Illya:**
Well, that's a little too, er... I'd still be hesitant to do that...

 
**Ruby:**
She says that because Illya has an all-purpose husbando big brother who she absolutely adores.

 
**Ruby:**
Although, having another person to silently adore when they aren't paying attention wouldn't be so bad. Pretty naughty if you ask me...

Crying!? What are you crying for??

 
**Ruby:**
Your Magical Girl Power has notably increased lately. Maybe it's time to pass out meet and greet tickets?

 
**Mash:**
I didn't know Senpai was that knowledgeable in a specific field of magecraft...

Please give me a lesson on it soon, if that's&mdash;Hmm?
I need to first binge-watch the entire box set? ...What's a box set?

U-Um... Then is it okay for me to just call you...

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru?

**Illya:**
A-And! Um...

 
**Illya:**
I know this is strange to say, but... the aura Mash gives off is kind of similar to my own family's...

 
**Illya:**
It's a bit of a relief, considering I don't even know where I am now.

 
**Mash:**
Is that... so? I'm glad to hear it.

 
**Ruby:**
Ho ho! If by “similar” you mean in terms of their curvaceous figures, then yes, there is one particular failed maid back at the house, isn't there!

 
**Illya:**
That's not what I'm talking about!

 
**Mash:**
Haha...

 
**Mash:**
So let me get your story straight, Illya...

 
**Mash:**
While trying to get from your own world to the neighboring “Mirror World,” you and the others ran into some trouble, the cause of which is unknown.

 
**Mash:**
After getting caught up in the mix, you and this “Miyu Edelfelt,” another magical girl, wound up here, in this different dimension.

 
**Mash:**
Immediately afterward, Miyu was kidnapped by a magical creature,

 
**Mash:**
and that's when Queen Medb appeared proclaiming herself as a magical girl, and attacked without question... is that correct?

 
**Illya:**
Yes. We've just arrived, and we know nothing about this strange world.

 
**Mash:**
We're in the same boat, since we just came from Chaldea too. Still, one thing's for sure...

 
**Mash:**
They came here from a parallel world that's different than our Earth.

 
**Illya:**
Oh! By the way, I may not look it, but I'm Japanese.
You have a Japan where you're from, right?

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru, Mash, what's your Earth like?

 
**Mash:**
...

**Illya:**
Oh, that's right. I need to hurry and go save Miyu!

 
**Illya:**
But please! I'd like to hear about it!
About that Chaldea place!

**Ruby:**
Earlier when we slammed into each other, I took the liberty of analyzing you. Force of habit, see.

 
**Ruby:**
Mash, you have a very rare class of Heroic Spirit installed, don't you?

 
**Mash:**
...Y-Yes. It's Shielder. But I'm not really sure what you mean by “installed,” I'm a...

 
**Illya:**
Yes, that! That's it! I just noticed a moment ago!

 
**Illya:**
I can't install the class card, Ruby! What should I do?

 
**Illya:**
Then Miyu can't either... Oh, I'm sorry.
Mash was in the middle of saying something.

 
**Mash:**
No, it's all right. But a spell to let a Heroic Spirit temporarily into your body is very unusual.

 
**Mash:**
There are cases as Pseudo-Servants, but they are an exception only used during the Grand Order...

 
**Mash:**
Maybe you yourself are special, Illya.
If Miyu uses the same kind of magecraft...

 
**Mash:**
There may be a connection to why Miyu was captured.

 
**Mash:**
Wouldn't that be a possibility, Master?

Right... Wait, what!? Me?
A magical girl...?

 
**Ruby:**
Very perceptive, my friend! I can smell magical girl talents just pouring out of Mash!

 
**Ruby:**
That means I must've sought help from an unknown magical girl when I was blown away☆

I guess that's my instinct as a magical stick?

I'll never forget how you ditched me in the middle of that fight, you know...

**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru! Mash! I've finally got hold of you two! Are you okay!?

 
**Illya:**
Whoa, whoa! A hologram?

 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Yes, we're fine!
There's no need to be afraid, Illya.

 
**Mash:**
This is Doctor Roman, chief of medical at Chaldea.

 
**Mash:**
He's a trustworthy ally who provides support during our missions.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh? Oooohh? I think I sense an incredibly cute and pure magical energy response nearby...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, glance to the right.
Do you see a wonderful Servant in front of you?

 
**Illya:**
Oh, um...? Are you perhaps talking about me?

 
**Mash:**
Doctor. Illya will get a really bad impression of you, so please restrain yourself.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup, that's what I thought.
Don't worry, I'll act like a good, responsible adult!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So, putting that aside, I have news for you.
Please don't be alarmed, but you're&mdash;

But they're draining away all my power...

No, Miyu! But then...!

What's a Reality Marble again?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, I've gotta explain it from there?
Right, I guess I do.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Reality Marble is one of the deepest secrets of magecraft.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Basically, it's magecraft that manifests the interior world of the caster, and paints over reality with what's inside their heart.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's one of the most forbidden of all techniques and just a step below True Magic. Like Unlimited Blade something-or-other.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But of course, under normal circumstances, something that crazy could never last.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Reality Marble is a stain on reality. The world itself detects that foreign body, that inconsistency, and moves to fix it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So unfortunately, a Reality Marble usually only lasts a few minutes.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did that make sense to you, Fujimaru?
And you, cute little lady?

 
**Illya:**
Umm... so basically, this entire world is just someone's creation?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup. I've never heard of a Reality Marble of this size, though.

 
**Illya:**
...I-I see...

 
**Illya:**
When I jumped to this world, for an instant I saw what looked like many castles and kingdoms...

 
**Illya:**
They were all very clearly visible, and very large.
And there was an area surrounded by a black wall...

 
**Illya:**
And all of that was a single spell...
A world that someone made...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup yup. It's so satisfying to see the surprised look on your face.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru seems to have gotten used to things lately, mostly just reacting with “Eh, it'll work out” and the like.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way... (Grin)
I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? (Big grin)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am Romani Archaman.
Call me Dr. Roman.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Cute little lady, what's your name? Who represents you? And what are your hobbies?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You have a Spirit Origin like a Servant, but you're quite clearly human.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're not a Demi-Servant or a Pseudo-Servant.
And this powerful magical energy...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Could you be the owner of the Reality Marble?
And would you finally tell me your name?

 
**Illya:**
N-No! I-I'm just a magical girl!
Th-Though I don't know if that's much better!

 
**Illya:**
Also, sorry for not introducing myself!
I'm Illyasviel von Einzbern.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you for the polite introduction!
Sorry for rushing you!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But... Einzbern... Einzbern, huh...?
I guess that got shot down before it even started...

 
**Illya:**
Hmm? Dr. Roman, do you know the Einzbern fam&ndash;
I mean, do you know my mom?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I've just seen that name before.
But looking at you, I assume you're a different person.

Doctor, can you get us back to Chaldea?

**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. If Mash is with you, it should be fine.
You'll be able to come back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I hope you do ASAP. Who knows what effects that space will have on you.

 
**Mash:**
Can you let Illya take refuge in Chaldea too?
Just temporarily?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm... Sorry, but that's impossible. Given the way the Rayshift works, it just can't happen.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Only Fujimaru and Mash can come back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We might be able to if she were one of Fujimaru's contracted Servants...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And, hypothetically, even if it were possible...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That would go against our goal of guarding humanity. This is why we've spent so much effort trying not to intervene in other eras.

 
**Mash:**
No, Doctor. Listen. She's from a parallel world, different than our own.

 
**Mash:**
And if this is all inside a Reality Marble, there should be no danger of us interfering.

 
**Mash:**
Can't you ask Da Vinci for help and just&mdash;

 
**Illya:**
Mash, Mash. Um... I'm fine.

 
**Illya:**
Thank you. (Bowing)But it's okay.

 
**Illya:**
I have to save Miyu. I can't go escape someplace safe on my own.

 
**Illya:**
So I'll do my best, even if I'm all by myself.

 
**Mash:**
Illya...

Fou, fou!

Kyuuuu...

**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, Da Vinci!? You can't just&ndash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
I've been listening to your conversation.
I'll give you all the help I can offer.

 
**Da Vinci:**
From the values I'm seeing, Mash isn't currently able to use her full power.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I think it's because the Reality Marble is deciding that she doesn't fully meet its conditions.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That world has its own rules, and its own unique Mystic Codes.

 
**Da Vinci:**
A lot of good could come from adapting to it, learning from it, and putting all that into practice.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It should be a good experience, both for Mash, and for Chaldea.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Aside from rescuing this captured magical girl or whatever.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Man, you're cold... Oooohh, fine!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We'll continue to monitor that world and the Rayshifts.
If it's just you two, you should be able to go back and forth. I promise that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So come back to Chaldea temporarily so we can regroup. That's an order.

It starts with you taking a nap here in the Command Room.

And then Mash comes by, spots you, and tries to wake you up.

“Senpai? Oh my. You're sleeping in a place like this again?”

“Senpai...”

That above all else, you're a member of Chaldea, and the one Master who can bring about the preservation of humanity.

If you say so, then I must be!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's have a tea party to celebrate the umpteenth time I have encountered someone new!

 


---
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Nursery Rhyme is a magical girl.
Tom Thumb's cute little picture book.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You, a magical girl who fled after completing her duty... And me, broken.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'll make your wishes come true.

 
**Mash:**
Uh...Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, I thought you'd forgotten about me.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mm, yes, she's definitely a Servant. Although it seems she is not the owner of the giant Reality Marble.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But at the same time, she's apparently also a Master. I suppose that's only natural, given her ability to control such magical beings.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If she's a Caster-class, this is worth investigating.
As such, be very careful!

 
**Mash:**
Right, roger that. Ah! Illya!? Master, you too!?

 
**Ruby:**
Just enjoying the tea party?
Not a hint of anxiety?

 
**Ruby:**
That's my Illya. What a big shot!

 
**Illya:**
Whew, I'm so glad we were able to have a nice chat.

 
**Illya:**
I'm Illya. Illyasviel von Einzbern.

 
**Illya:**
Nursery Rhyme, you're not just a magical girl, but also the Queen of the Land of Sweets?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's right. I'm a big deal.
I can command anything.

 
**Illya:**
Th-Then, Your Highness, I have a special favor to ask of you!

 
**Illya:**
Can you please tell me if you or the people of the Land of Sweets know anything about a friend who came to this world with me?

 
**Illya:**
Anything will do!
If there's anything, then&mdash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Sure. If you play with me, I'll tell you.

 
**Illya:**
...Huh?

Are there any other magical girls besides you?


---
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
If you play with me, I'll tell you the answer to that too.

 
**Illya:**
Ugh... Look, Nursery, can't we just play later?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
No! (Shaking head)

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I mean, I'm bored. I'm in a rut.
My only playmate is a black sheep.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Say, have you seen it? It's a very cute sheep.

 
**Illya:**
A black... sheep? I-I can't say I have, no.
M-Meeeh meeeh. Hee hee, just kidding.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tee hee hee! Nothing like that, Illya!
That was terrible!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
A black sheep sounds like this:
Baaaa, baaa.

 
**Illya:**
Oh yeah, that was the Japanese sound.
Um, b-baaa, baaa?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yes, you've got it!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Now, let's all call for it together.
Baaaa, baaa.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
♪Baa, baa, Glasya-Labolas, have you any blood?
♪One of the 72 Spirits, President of Hell!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
♪Baa, baa, Black Goat, have you any young?
♪Iä, Iä, Shub-Niggurath, Glasya-Labolas!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Come to me, come to me! My cute black sheep!

 
**Illya:**
!!!

 
**Illya:**
Eeep! Y-Y-Y-Yikes! That isn't part of the rhyme!

 
**Mash:**
Uh, what!? That's...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'm just so tired of the sweets people. They break straight away, making it impossible to play with them.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Although they were originally humans, so I can't blame them.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
But my black sheep is kinder than anyone.
It'll play with me forever and ever.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Now, let's play together.

No choice but to go all out, it seems...
 
**Illya:**
Her way of playing is really different than mine... (Crying)

 
**Ruby:**
That's what queens are like.
They're always hungry for excitement.

 
**Illya:**
This is too much excitement, don't you think!?

## World End Match: Nursery☆Rhyme
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Ah, that was so much fun!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Huh? What, you're looking for someone? If it's something that simple, you should've told me from the start.

 
**Illya:**
I did!!

 
**Illya:**
She has black hair, she's a little taller than me, and she's a magical girl like me!

 
**Ruby:**
Wait a moment! If we are talking about Miyu's appearance...

 
**Ruby:**
I shall project a number of curated photos and videos from your prized collection, Illya!

 
**Illya:**
Wait, I don't know what you're talking about!
That can't be good, so stop!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Magical girl? Your friend is a magical girl?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I see...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Then I don't know anything about her.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I think you should just give up. Too bad.

What's that supposed to mean?


---
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You know what this world is?
A merry party hall where magical girls gather.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
When they get tired of playing, they disappear, one after the other.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's the rule. There's no getting around it.

 
**Mash:**
So there are magical girls other than Queen Medb?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
As far as I know.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
And magical girls who did their best make their own playground.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
My Land of Sweets is one of them.
Let me see... What else is there...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
There's the Land of Dragons and Sea, the Land of Dead Bookshelves...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Hmm, what else?
...Oh, the Land of Snow and Honey!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Those are the kingdoms I've heard of, but I don't know what kind of magical girls live there.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh, and also...

 
**Illya:**
...Also?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Nothing. Never mind.
Ah, here. Take this.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
This is to thank you for playing with me and my black sheep. I had fun.

 
**Illya:**
...A j-jewel!? I-It's a diamond!
A big, beautiful diamond!

 
**Ruby:**
We got an important item! I feel a sense of affinity!

 
**Illya:**
I-I can't accept this!
It's too valuable!

 
**Illya:**
I'm sure Rin would be pleased, but giving it to me...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's fine. I'm a magical girl, remember?
And that... That is my special twinkling star.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That jewel may help you find your friend.

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru, what should we do?

**Illya:**
O-Okay. Maybe it would be rude not to...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yep, it would be rude.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'm a queen, so I have no regrets. Ahahaha.

**Mash:**
I agree with Master.

 
**Mash:**
If it can help us in finding Miyu, then I think we should just give in and borrow it.

 
**Illya:**
R-Right. Then we'll take it.
We'll give it back to you later, Nursery.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...

**Ruby:**
You did it, Illya! Let's keep going like this and gather more jewels!

 
**Illya:**
Um, Ruby, have you lost sight of our goal?

We don't even know how this jewel will come in handy yet.

By the way, Mash, have you noticed?


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Are you talking about that last battle?

 
**Mash:**
My attack on Nursery Rhyme actually had an effect on her&ndash;albeit not completely.

 
**Mash:**
Perhaps she and Queen Medb possess different traits, even though they're both magical girls?

 
**Mash:**
...Or perhaps I myself have changed in some way?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't detect any significant changes in Mash's status from here.

 
**Ruby:**
That's not true. Mash's MG Power is skyrocketing!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
MG Power? The magical systems in other worlds sure are original...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Talking Mystic Codes alone are unusual,

 
**Dr. Roman:**
but that personality is so unique that it goes beyond rare and into the realm of junk...

 
**Illya:**
My apologies for all the trouble.
Please ignore 90% of whatever Ruby says.

 
**Illya:**
...Ah! The jewel! This light... It's so bright!

 
**Mash:**
Nursery Rhyme's jewel is clearly pointing us in a fixed direction.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. And the direction is...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Going by topography inside the Reality Marble that we've already identified, it's toward a group of islands situated in an ocean.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm guessing this is the “Land of Dragons and Sea” that Nursery Rhyme mentioned?

 
**Illya:**
The Land of Dragons and Sea...

All right, let's check it out!


---
 
**Mash:**
...So we're not going to the Land of Snow and Honey, where Queen Medb is?

 
**Mash:**
“When in magical lands, do as the mages do,” is it? I see. That might be the case here.

 
**Mash:**
I'll follow your instincts, Master.

 
**Illya:**
Yes, I think that's a good idea.
We don't know enough about this world.

 
**Illya:**
At this rate, we could end up going in circles... or even worse, fall prey to a terrible trap!

 
**Illya:**
But if the decision's been made, then come on!
Mash, Fujimaru, let's hurry!

 
## 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea I
 
**Miyu:**
(Huff... puff...)

 
**Miyu:**
...!

 
**A：???:**
Miyu.

 
**Miyu:**
...

 
**A：???:**
Answer me, Miyu. Miyu Edelfelt.
You still refuse to be mine?

 
**Miyu:**
Don't...touch me. Undo these restraints!

 
**A：???:**
...That magical energy of yours, flowing through that Voile de Deuil, is simply wonderful.

 
**A：???:**
But it's not just about the magical energy.
Your very existence is functioning as a superb vessel.

 
**A：???:**
Just a little more and it will reach the outside world.
Just one more step and I'll be able to fulfill my dream.

 
**Miyu:**
I refuse to negotiate with someone who won't show her face!

 
**First Lady:**
Heh-heh. I'm the First Lady.
That's what they call me.

 
**First Lady:**
As long as all of you are magical girls, you can't resist me.

 
**Miyu:**
Sto...Mm, nghh...

 
**First Lady:**
Tsk. You bit my lip.

 
**First Lady:**
You look submissive, but you're a stubborn one, aren't you?

 
**First Lady:**
I don't mind that.

 
**Miyu:**
...Hmm? The First... Are you...?

 
**First Lady:**
Heh. Those restraints, the Voile de Deuil, are alive.

 
**First Lady:**
Will the spell that continues to eat away at your magical circuits reach your subconscious mind first...

 
**First Lady:**
...or will your precious Illyasviel arrive here first?
I wonder which it will be.

 
**First Lady:**
Either way, I will accomplish it.
The dream of abandoned girls...

 
**Miyu:**
Unh...

 
**Miyu:**
Illya...

 
## 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea II
 
**Illya:**
Wow, it's the ocean! I can see a dolphin swimming over there, too!

 
**Illya:**
I still can't believe that this is someone's imaginary world.

 
**Mash:**
Me neither. The scale of it is as large as a Holy Grail phenomenon.

 
**Mash:**
Speaking of which, we were lucky that Ruby was equipped with a navigation mode.

 
**Mash:**
You truly are all-purpose. Sailing wouldn't have been possible had we been on our own.

 
**Illya:**
I'm surprised to see Ruby is actually helpful.

 
**Ruby:**
Aw, you're praising me too much! (Embarrassed)
...Hey! I'm always helpful!

 
**Ruby:**
I have up to 24 secret functions!
I can pretty much do anything, you know!

**Mash:**
That's a good idea.
Oh, are these bento boxes from Chaldea?

 
**Mash:**
Can we each choose our own?
...I can hardly decide. Illya, which one would you like?

Yay! I'm actually starving! Eeny, meeny, miney, mo...

**Illya:**
Eep, it's hot! Is this freshly made!?

 
**Mash:**
What? Senpai, did you cook this yourself?

 
**Mash:**
A chef in a red overcoat taught you how? With ingredients the doctor provided? When did you...?

 
**Illya:**
This mapo tofu is amazing! I can actually eat it! It's not a dangerous-looking color! It's a little bit spicy, yet slightly sweet!

 
**Illya:**
Awww, I never imagined such safe mapo tofu existed in this world!

 
**Ruby:**
Is that supposed to be your review of the dish?

 
**Mash:**
It's so tasty, it's comforting.
But I'm not sure if it's good enough to make you cry.

 
**Mash:**
Um, take your time, Illya.
Mapo will never attack you, I think.

 
**Illya:**
(Om nom nom) This is so good.

P-Pickled mushrooms!? In a one-kilogram jar!?

 
**Mash:**
Wh-Who supplied this to us?

 
**Mash:**
Leonidas? He succeeded in growing mushrooms in Chaldea?

 
**Mash:**
I didn't know he had such a hobby. I'm impressed. (Adjusts glasses)

 
**Mash:**
There's even warm rice and everything. Very well then. Don't mind if I do.

 
**Mash:**
(Sniff, sniff... Lick) ... (Om nom nom)
... Oh, actually, this is good.

 
**Illya:**
It's delicious! (Om nom nom)
I feel it will help me vigorously speed up my mundane work!

**Dr. Roman:**
Hi, are you still eating?
No need to stop, but just listen.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are some things I need to confirm with Illya.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You mentioned that you magical girls faced some trouble when you tried to move to the Mirror World.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
How do you return to the real world you originally came from? Do you have any idea?

 
**Illya:**
I...

 
**Illya:**
I wasn't thinking about it at all!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow, I'm amazed. That might be the secret to the power of magical girls.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So going back is difficult after all...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, Ruby? What is your view on this?

 
**Ruby:**
Yes? Let me see...

 
**Ruby:**
Neither Illya nor Miyu can use spells that advanced.

 
**Ruby:**
To be more exact, even if they somehow cast a spell, they wouldn't have the skill and knowledge to precisely select the location to return to.

 
**Ruby:**
I need them to figure it out themselves.
After all, I'm just a stick.

 
**Ruby:**
Actually, I have no problem with the way it is now, you know?

 
**Illya:**
No! It's a big problem! You're not being useful at all, Ruby!

 
**Illya:**
But... you're right. I was too busy thinking about Miyu...

 
**Illya:**
I was forgetting about many things.

 
**Mash:**
I understand. You have your family and friends in the original world, Illya.

 
**Illya:**
Yes... Rin and Luvia...

 
**Illya:**
Sella, Leysritt, my big brother... Everyone at school... They might be worried about me...

 
**Illya:**
(Gasp!)

 
**Ruby:**
What's wrong? You look very pale.
Like the pale blue sea! (Smug)

 
**Illya:**
Oh my gosh... I forgot something very important...

 
**E：Illya:**
Chloe...! I left Chloe behind in the real world!

 
**Ruby:**
Well, that may be true, but I have a feeling that Chloe is doing okay without you.

 
**Ruby:**
Knowing Chloe, instead of worrying about you, she's probably happy to keep Shirou all to herself. She'd be all, “Whoo hoo! Heh heh heh!”

 
**Ruby:**
That tanned little devil is probably turning on her devilish charm and gloating right now!

 
**Illya:**
You should be worried about other things!
Like... Like th-that!! Remember THAT!?

 
**Ruby:**
Huh? What is it? Can you please explain with words, with that mouth of yours?

 
**Illya:**
Morals!

**Illya:**
I'm sorry. It's a rather long story.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sounds pretty complicated.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, I can't make empty promises, but I will do all I can.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The fact that your world and our world connected in some sort of magical way...

**--BATTLE--**
 
**A：???:**
Lord Jason, intruders have broken through the wyverns' defenses and are now approaching.

 
**Mini Jason:**
You don't have to report every little thing to me.
I can see that myself!

 
**Mini Jason:**
A lovely pink magical girl and a black magical girl who looks both sturdy and squishy.

 
**Mini Jason:**
If you ask me, the former's more gorgeous than you, and the latter's more endowed.

 
**Mini Jason:**
A crushing loss on your part! For a match to be decided before it's even begun... Jeez! Not even funny!

 
**A：???:**
Lord Jason, Lord Jason. Please provide an accurate comparison of the enemies once again.

 
**B：Burnt Jason:**
Yes. I will rephrase my analysis.

 
**B：Burnt Jason:**
The former's not as flowery (read: callous) as you, and the latter's not as sexy (read: crazy).

 
**B：Burnt Jason:**
Now what do you think?

 
**A：???:**
Oh, my... Lord Jason, what embarrassing compliments you brazenly give me.

 
**A：???:**
But lying is no good.

 
**A：???:**
The pink one's not as physically developed as I am, and the black one's clad in colder, more impersonal colors.

 
**Mini Jason:**
(Did she just ignore me? And so effortlessly!)

 
**Mini Jason:**
Whatever. In any event, I successfully got around your unreasonable demands!

 
**Mini Jason:**
You always make things a deadly venture, even in casual conversation!

 
**A：Medea Lily:**
Yes. I love peace, but I have no sympathy for intruders.

 
**A：Medea Lily:**
I shall punish thieves.

 
**A：Medea Lily:**
Sister Circe said that you can ask them what their circumstances are after their punishment ends.

 
**Mini Jason:**
She's totally right. The Land of Dragons and Sea isn't as sweet and as smart as, well, me.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Everyone here is gentle, the people are happy, they all worship me&ndash;or so it seems.

 
**Mini Jason:**
But in actuality, there's a crazy queen who turns any bad kiddies into piggies, no matter how small their crimes!

 
**Mini Jason:**
That's the reality of this oceanic dictatorship, this Medea Psycho Land! Hahahaha, help me!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Lord Jason. Did you say something?

 
**Mini Jason:**
Nothing important.
I was just giving a speech.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Anyway, it's a war. We're fighting a war, Medea.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Seems the girls took the wyverns down without a hitch. In my great wisdom I expected as much.

 
**Medea Lily:**
What? So you weren't actually bringing out the big guns with those wyverns? Lord Jason, what on earth are you planning?

 
**Mini Jason:**
Humph. What do you think the best weapon to defeat your enemy in battle is?

 
**Mini Jason:**
It's not a powerful Noble Phantasm or natural disaster. It's carelessness. It's being careless, Medea.

 
**Mini Jason:**
A relaxed mentality is the poison that kills humans.
I'll secretly make them realize that later!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Hahaha! They'll be very proud of themselves after defeating those wyverns, and I'll be the one to break that pride!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Of course, I will destroy them, ship and all! Remember, magical girls are as stubborn as they come!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Just when you think you've defeated them, just when you breathe a sigh of relief, there they are the next day!

 
**Mini Jason:**
“Rise and shine, Lord Jason,” they'll say. “It's morning♡” they'll say!

 
**Mini Jason:**
That's my waking nightmare, so that is the horror I will inflict upon them!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Understood. So we'll make them deader than dead.
Got it.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Come on, Magical Ship in a Bottle, release!

 
**Medea Lily:**
But... please forgive me. I didn't know how much to prepare for the ship...

 
**Medea Lily:**
All I managed was five dozen Dragon Tooth Warriors and a ram bearing a curse that decays the enemy's keel.

 
**Medea Lily:**
That's all I have on hand.
My apologies.

 
**Mini Jason:**
...So you always carry all that around? How terrifying. I'm curious as to what your definition of a peace-loving heart is.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes! I'm not good in battle, but I'll do my best!
All right everyone, charge!

 
**Mini Jason:**
...Okaaaay, so you're not listening at all, but that's awesome! My wife is the best of the best!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
M-Master! Now there's a galley charging at us!

 
**Illya:**
What? There's more? They don't have any intention of talking at all!

 
**Mash:**
Even if we were the ones who trespassed into their territory first, they're still so aggressive!

We're winning, but they won't let up!
They're closing in on us!

 
**Mash:**
Is it this kingdom's magical girl?
She's a very cautious and well-prepared opponent.

 
**Illya:**
Yup, I can feel them getting closer.
We have Nursery's stone to thank for that.

 
**Illya:**
Wah! That's them! That's...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Greetings, visitors from another world.
I am Medea...

 
**Medea Lily:**
The Magical Girl of Love and Healing, Medical☆Medea.
A pleasure to meet you.

 
**Mini Jason:**
...

 
**Illya:**
Th-That outfit...! Ruby, is she...!

 
**Ruby:**
Yup! It's a liiittle different, but that formal-yet-naughty slit is definitely Caster!

 
**Ruby:**
Caster, the mage Servant! Illya's first real opponent!

 
**Illya:**
Yes, that's right!

 
**Illya:**
I'm sorry about what happened!
I'm Illya! Illyasviel!

 
**Mash:**
Illya, do you know her?

 
**Illya:**
Yes, but she may not know me...
Oh, but who's that handsome doll?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Are we acquaintances?
Oh my...

 
**Medea Lily:**
I wouldn't have been so rough if I'd known. I'm sorry.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I don't dwell on the past... So even if we were friends...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Why don't we forget about it and focus on the present? It's easier to forget the bad things that happened in the past, right?

 
**Illya:**
Huh...?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. So let's forget about our battle just now.
We can just chalk it up to a mistake on both sides.

 
**Mash:**
...She lowered her staff... Whatever the case, I'm glad the fight's over.

 
**Mash:**
I think we can resolve this by talking, like magical girls are supposed to!

If we can actually talk to her...
 


---
 
**Medea Lily:**
Talking? That's a wonderful idea.

 
**Medea Lily:**
If you could take an opponent's life just through conversation, that's better than fighting.

 
**Medea Lily:**
That's how you obtained that jewel, isn't it?
That jewel covered in the blood of its former owner?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Which kingdom's magical girl did you kill?
I'm sure it was a very difficult fight.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Would you tell me how you did it?
I'd like to know... just for reference, of course.

 
**Illya:**
Th-That's not how it happened, Medea!

 
**Illya:**
I did end up battling a magical girl, but...

 
**Illya:**
We didn't try to kill each other.
Nursery gave this to me.

 
**Medea Lily:**
...

 
**Mini Jason:**
...

 
**Medea Lily:**
I see. I understand. So you came from Nursery Rhyme's kingdom.

 
**Medea Lily:**
And now you've come to take my jewel.
Hehe. How energetic and strong-minded you are!

 
**Medea Lily:**
As a magical girl, you're not someone I can welcome, but as a queen, you're not someone I can ignore either!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Am I right, Lord Jason?
They say they're gathering jewels.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I would like to praise you for your bravery and recklessness. Everyone, would you come to my castle?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Tell me of your travels on the way. It's been centuries since I've been able to talk to a magical girl!

 
## 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea III
 
**Medea Lily:**
This castle belongs to me and Lord Jason.
Please come inside.

 
**Illya:**
(Psst... “Lord Jason”? Does she mean that doll?)

 
**Mash:**
(I think so...)

Can I ask you a question?
 


---
 
**Medea Lily:**
Anything you like, as long as it's something I remember. Oh, but I already know what you're going to ask.

 
**Medea Lily:**
You're thinking I might be Medea, the Heroic Spirit of the Princess of Colchis. Correct?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Well, hehe, you're wrong. It's true that I was born from Princess Medea, yes...

 
**Medea Lily:**
But I'm not the Servant you think I am.
Even if she exists in your world, it's a different person.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I was merely modeled after Princess Medea.
I am but a young girl's fantasy.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I act like Medea, I get sad like her, laugh like her, and I live happily in the tiny world I was given.

 
**Medea Lily:**
The Servant System is an active summoning system, but we are passive, and born from the unconscious.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Our purpose was different from the start.

 
**Mash:**
A different purpose? You didn't come here because you were summoned?

 
**Medea Lily:**
That's right. I was wished to be this way.

 
**Medea Lily:**
And there is no final goal in this wish.

 
**Medea Lily:**
There's only a sudden end. Even if we saved the world, we weren't able to end.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Because as long as we were sought, the next story would soon begin.

 
**Medea Lily:**
But that's all in the past, now that I've found myself here.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I see. I understand your situation.

 
**Medea Lily:**
So unlike Illya, you wandered here from a different world, did you, Fujimaru?

 
**Medea Lily:**
To find oneself in a strange land, and not know what to do... That helpless feeling is something I know well.

 
**Medea Lily:**
So I won't just turn you into a pig. To tell you the truth, that was my original intention when I invited you here.

 
**Ruby:**
Oh, I knew it. I knew this castle reeked of ash.

 
**Ruby:**
Probably has all the walls ready to scatter special caustic lime.

 
**Ruby:**
Stuff that would turn you all into little piglets.

 
**Ruby:**
As expected from a priestess from the Age of Gods, her magecraft is on a different level than ours.

 
**Illya:**
Hyah!? Ruby, you should've said that earlier!

 
**Illya:**
Oh, but, but... if you're going to leave Fujimaru be, then you can do the same for me...

 
**Medea Lily:**
No. You're different. You're a magical girl.
I'm very cruel to magical girls.

 
**Mini Jason:**
...

 
**Medea Lily:**
What? But I don't want to be betrayed anymore.
That girl won't betray me? I should trust your eyes?

 
**Mash:**
She's talking to Jason again...
We can't hear him though...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Very well... This is what Lord Jason says:

 
**Medea Lily:**
“That magical girl isn't smart enough to lie. Her heart is as free of deceit as her chest is of breasts.”

 
**Illya:**
Excuse me, but can I karate-chop him?

 
**Medea Lily:**
What? No! I'm the only one who can have my way with Lord Jason, so please don't.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Anyway, Lord Jason is being gentlemanly for once.

 
**Medea Lily:**
He's saying to call off the sneak attack and talk with you instead.

 
**Illya:**
Oh, uh... That's what we were planning from the start, so we can talk all you want.

 
**Medea Lily:**
No, I'm not interested in your problems.
I don't care about other magical girls.

 
**Medea Lily:**
What I'm going to offer you is a peaceful trade.

 
**Medea Lily:**
This island and this castle remind me of Corinth.
I simply want to continue my tranquil life here.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Whatever you do outside this land, I promise I won't interfere.

That's fine with me. Does everyone agree?


---
 
**Illya:**
Yup, of course! If we weren't just attacked out of nowhere like that, we wouldn't have...

 
**Illya:**
Right, Mash?

 
**Mash:**
But what about the jewel's guidance?
And what did you mean by “trade”?

 
**Medea Lily:**
I meant that, just as I won't interfere with your business, you won't interfere with mine.

 
**Medea Lily:**
And no, no matter how much you want it, you can't have this jewel. I've named it the “Tomoi Stone.”

 
**Medea Lily:**
This stone is what supports this oceanic kingdom, and gives me my power.

 
**Medea Lily:**
This world is big, but it's also tightly closed.
There were once many more magical girls here.

 
**Medea Lily:**
They all wanted a kingdom of their own, and so fought with and stole from each other.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I was one of those girls.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I am a healer. A medical magical girl.
I have barely any means of attacking.

 
**Medea Lily:**
The most I have is mental offense and divine punishment&ndash;things like pig transformation, tiny world confinement, and so on.

 
**Medea Lily:**
The battle was very difficult. I was a relatively weak magical girl, after all.

 
**Illya:**
Ugh... It's like hearing an amazing swimmer say,
“But I don't know how to fly.”

 
**Mini Jason:**
...

 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure, but I think Jason is saying,
“There's nobody as scary as you!”

 
**Medea Lily:**
Silence, you barbarians, you who specialize in destruction! ...Speaking of which, I want to try a Buster Noble Phantasm too!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Ahem. Excuse me. I'll get back on topic.

 
**Medea Lily:**
The magical girls fought each other in pursuit of their own ideals for peace and order. It was a clash of values and worldviews.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I tried to run from the fierce combat, but it was impossible.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Each time an enemy came I would just stab, stab, and stab some more...

Master, it's probably best to ignore that.
Who knows when Rule Breaker might show up?

**Medea Lily:**
Before long, this stone that appeared in my hand grew in weight and shone brighter each time I fought.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I can tell. This stone is the catalyst that supports this fantasy.

What of the area outside the kingdoms' jurisdiction?
 


---
 
**Medea Lily:**
You must be talking about the areas where the magical girls' influence doesn't reach.

 
**Medea Lily:**
That's the neutral zone: a buffer zone born from the balance of power that all the fighting gave rise to.

 
**Medea Lily:**
You cannot receive the blessings of your power there.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Do you understand? This jewel is the only small hope I have left.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Taking this from me would be equivalent to my death.

 
**Medea Lily:**
So the only thing I can give you is a promise to leave you alone. Illya, I won't try to steal your jewel.

 
**Medea Lily:**
So please leave. With that jewel you can create whatever land you want.

 
**Medea Lily:**
If you want something, use your stone to get it instead.
If you want friends, make a land of friends.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I'm sure it'll be wonderful. A place where everyone who visits becomes your friend.

 
**Illya:**
That isn't right.

 
**Illya:**
I don't want more friends.
I want to be with one I already have.

 
**Illya:**
We go to school together... We laugh together...

 
**Illya:**
Sometimes we fight and go our separate ways, but even then, before long our desire to see each other again becomes too great.

 
**Illya:**
I was able to meet someone like that, someone as important to me as myself.

 
**Illya:**
So I don't need anything else.

 
**Illya:**
Compared to you and your wish to just live in peace,
I know it's a very greedy and selfish goal, but...

 
**Illya:**
I'm sorry! Please! I came here to save my friend!

 
**Illya:**
I'm not here to steal your jewel!
I don't even really know what they do!

 
**Illya:**
You know a lot about this world.
If you could just give us some clues...

 
**Medea Lily:**
...A way to get out?

 
**Medea Lily:**
It may seem cruel, Illya, but you cannot leave this world now.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Not only can you not save your friend, there's no exit for you either. As long as you're a magical girl.

 
**Medea Lily:**
No, you won't even have the will to leave...
That's how desperate this place is.

 
**Medea Lily:**
In the end, you will always be a weak magic user, a weak magical girl...

 
**Medea Lily:**
One who could only make miracles happen for the sake of her friends.

 
**Medea Lily:**
So in the end, you will definitely come to rely on the power of that jewel.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Just like we did, burning each other to ash as we clung to that tiny hope...

 
**Illya:**
In the end, I'm going to rely on this jewel?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Give up on this Miyu girl. If you want to know how to make friends, I'll happily teach you.

 
**Medea Lily:**
That is the one thing I can do for Nursery Rhyme, the girl who gave you that jewel and disappeared.

 
**Illya:**
Huh? Wait, what does that&mdash;

 
**Medea Lily:**
The jewels are where our wishes dwell.
They are the last light that keeps us alive...

 
**Medea Lily:**
When Nursery Rhyme let hers go, she quickly vanished into nothingness.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Of course, there's no need for you to be sad.
That was her choice.

 
**Medea Lily:**
And even without waiting for her destruction...

 
**Medea Lily:**
That greedy Medb, Queen of the Land of Snow and Honey, would never ignore her.

 
**Medea Lily:**
The Land of Sweets will fall to Medb's forces sooner or later.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Perhaps Nursery let you escape from Medb's clutches.

 
**Illya:**
No...

 
**Illya:**
No... I'm sorry...

 
**Illya:**
I didn't know... I'm sorry, Nursery...

 
**Illya:**
But I...! I have to... I have to save Miyu no matter what...!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh dear. It was probably your stubbornness that drove Nursery to action.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Or maybe she'd given up herself, and was on the verge of disappearing.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Even if she could not do it, she entrusted her hope to someone promising who still&mdash;
Aargh! Geez!

 
**Medea Lily:**
It's so stupid! That's the problem with sugar-brained magical girls who come from fairy tales!

 
**Mash:**
Medea!? What is this dangerous aura around her?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Half-assed hope! How many times do you have to get betrayed before they're satisfied?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Wake up, Lord Jason! Let me hear some of those nasty little comments you always make!

She's finally shown her true self!

**Mini Jason:**
Ha! This is great! The type of person Medea wants to see least in the world has come to visit her.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Someone who keeps going, even towards uncertainty. Someone who tries hard, even if they don't know how.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Someone who does their best no matter how battered and bruised they get! Someone who doesn't even think about compensation!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Medea! Just like you when you were in the temple, before you joined me!

 
**Mini Jason:**
That's why you're showing your true self!

 
**Mini Jason:**
What you feel isn't anger born of hatred.
It's righteous rage, born of sorrow!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Don't tell me that, after all this, you're feeling sorry for yourself and wishing you'd tried a little harder!

 
**Medea Lily:**
N-No! I wasn't... I didn't...

 
**Medea Lily:**
I am the Queen of the Land of Dragons and Sea!
A priestess of the goddess Hecate!

 
**Medea Lily:**
You were never able to become king, no matter what you did, so I built a kingdom for you and settled down!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Yes, that's right. That's right. You couldn't even kill yourself. So that's what's right for you.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Which means now, you must follow your own fate!

 
**Mini Jason:**
You can work, work hard, or work even harder! A magical girl is all about doing things all the way! Right?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh, um... Th-That's... That's right!
I'll do it! I'll get to work!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Good answer! Let's see, to start with...

 
**Mini Jason:**
The Spartoi Family's “Adventure on Siren Island” diorama has a long ways to go!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Right, Lord Jason!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Plus that 1/48th scale Argo kit and the Supermobile DX Talos are still in their boxes!

 
**Mini Jason:**
You're not going to call yourself Greece's greatest builder without completing those two, are you? Aren't you embarrassed?

 
**Medea Lily:**
I'm sorry, Lord Jason! But I gave Talos to Europa...

The God Nipper that Hephaestus forged for you is crying!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes, Ultimate! You're right, Lord Jason!

 


---
 
**Mini Jason:**
All right, you're finally fired up! It was worth making you talk to those people, even if it was a pain!

 
**Mini Jason:**
That non-aggression pact is useless now! We're dang lucky a jewel came to us before Medb arrived!

 
**Mini Jason:**
You lost the will to fight, so this is truly your last chance!

 
**Mini Jason:**
All you can do is heal? Don't be stupid, ignoramuses!
I think you're great!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Right, my pretty little Medea?

 
**Mini Jason:**
Show me once more how violent it is to not be able to die in battle!

 
**Medea Lily:**
R-Right! Thank you! I will! I will!

 
**Ruby:**
...Um.

 
**Ruby:**
It looks like she couldn't handle her guilty conscience as a healing-type magical girl, and pushed all her will to fight onto her familiar.

 
**Ruby:**
It's common for magical girls in puberty to be dependent like that.

 
**Illya:**
I didn't want to know that! And Medea looks like she really wants to fight!

 
**Illya:**
Oh, Mash... Are you going to transform!?

 
**Mash:**
Medea won't be an easy opponent!

Whew, I guess healing alone wasn't enough, but I already knew that! Hahahaha!

 
**Mini Jason:**
By the way, you hot magical girls over there!

Look out, Lord Jason!

Oof!

Heh-heh... Even as words of concern spilled from your mouth, you specifically went for a head shot...

Is that you telling me you haven't given in yet, my Medea? Maybe you still have another card up your sleeve?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Of course! It's natural for magical girls to have two stages of transformation!

 
**Medea Lily:**
I don't want to, but I have no choice but to unleash my forbidden power! To be specific, I will no longer be Lily!

 
**Mini Jason:**
Hey, whoa, wait. Let's slow down.
If you're not going to be Lily, you're going to be THAT?

 
**Mini Jason:**
It's that form that burned down the castle in Corinth. That's bad. That's really bad! It's too monstrous!

 
**Mini Jason:**
We're having a magical girl party, so if a magical old hag appears, I'll be sued for false advertising!

 
**Mini Jason:**
And believe me, you would be the one who gets hurt if that happened!

 
**Mini Jason:**
I'm telling you this for your own good. I'd much rather become an indescribable pillar-like thing than have that happen! Oof!

Quiet, Lord Jason!
Medea is serious, Master!

I wouldn't get hurt at all!
And I won't be an “old hag” 10 years from now!

I'm sure I will be a lovely, elegant adult woman!

But I at least understand that you have something you hold dear! Something you've been fighting for!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Illya... Um, that...is very moving, but...

 
**Mini Jason:**
Medea fights for no special reason.
It's not for the sake of something she “holds dear.”

 
**Medea Lily:**
Lord Jason!?

 
**Mini Jason:**
She created this land because she felt indebted to me. And she's been protecting the jewel out of fear of other magical girls.

 
**Mini Jason:**
She made an excuse to live a quiet life because she believed that would keep her from becoming a menacing witch.

 
**Mini Jason:**
I tell you, she's frivolous about everything. The only time she gets serious is when she's building models.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I...admit that. But it was you, Lord Jason, who commanded me to confine myself here.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Well, of course. If you leave your own land, you'll become a witch. That's your fate.

 
**Mini Jason:**
And if you become a witch, you turn into just another Echo. That's why I advised against going to other lands.

 
**Mash:**
(Echo?)

 
**Mini Jason:**
But you don't need to worry anymore. Here, young lady. You want this, don't you? Take it.

 
**Illya:**
A-Are you sure!? After all, without this, um, lots of things...

 
**Mini Jason:**
Spare me the details.

 
**Mini Jason:**
If we beat you, then I win.
But if we lose, then Medea loses... Get it?

 
**Mini Jason:**
I'm twisted that way. I wouldn't give that stone away to anyone who wants it.

 
**Mini Jason:**
I will, however, push it into the hands of a noble fool who says they don't. Whether they like it or not.

 
**Mini Jason:**
That's okay with you, isn't it, Medea?
Either way, we'd lose if we went to war against Medb.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Before that happens, it feels better to pass it all on to a fool who is a lot like you in the past.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I... don't mind. But are you sure about this, Lord Jason?

 
**Mini Jason:**
I'm not happy, but I'm used to it.
Fading away while indulging in past glories...

 
**Mini Jason:**
But not becoming a witch is more important than that. Even if your dreams are dashed, it's better to pass on as a girl.

 
**Mini Jason:**
Isn't that right, my Medea?

 
**Mini Jason:**
And I think of this as my life coming to a close at one final stop in an unknown land before returning to my home.

 
**Medea Lily:**
...

 
**Medea Lily:**
I understand. As it is Lord Jason's wish, I will give her the jewel.

 
**Medea Lily:**
However, I won't tell you anything.
If I talk, it will only bring back sad memories.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Like all of the girls I have slain, my fate will end here.

 
**Illya:**
Medea. Um, you're going to disappear here, too?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. But even without “hope,” I still have
“lingering attachments,” so it will take a while.

 
**Medea Lily:**
After all, I still have 287,000 plastic models to finish.

 
**Medea Lily:**
At three models a day, it'll take me 250 years!
Go, go, Medea!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. So Princess Medea's magecraft was what interfered with the transmissions.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So what happened? Were you able to get any new information?

We learned about the hidden side of Medea Lily.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. That Medea and the Heroic Spirit Medea have separate existences, but plenty of things in common.

 
**Mash:**
I think what we got a glimpse of in battle this time applies roughly to both Medeas.

We got the jewel.
 
**Mash:**
Illya obtained the second jewel.
But that's all.

 
**Mash:**
Medea said we'd better investigate the basics of this world on our own.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm... From what I'm hearing, it sounds like Princess Medea knows everything, but kept her silence.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Was that a dig against Illya, or was it out of thoughtfulness?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Either way, I'm glad no one was hurt.
Huh? Where is Illya? I don't see her.

 
**Mash:**
Illya said it was too windy here, so she went to the stern. Ruby is with her.

 
**Illya:**
Um, Ruby...

 
**Ruby:**
Yo ho! You called?

 
**Ruby:**
What's this? You seem down in the dumps.
Even after a major victory of a sort.

 
**Illya:**
That was no major victory.
Medea wasn't going all-out to begin with.

 
**Illya:**
She fought because she had to, because we muscled our way into her land.

 
**Illya:**
...And in the end, I took that jewel away from her...

 
**Ruby:**
I think you're looking at it the wrong way.

 
**Ruby:**
Sometimes people have no use for something, but can't throw it away because that would be a waste.

 
**Ruby:**
I think that's what this jewel was to Medea.

 
**Ruby:**
She's a very powerful magical girl, you know.

 
**Ruby:**
Even without the jewel, she would've been able to create her own land.

 
**Illya:**
...Yeah. But despite her power, Medea was glum and haunted by dark memories.

 
**Illya:**
She said I wouldn't be able to escape from this world... so long as I'm a magical girl.

 
**Illya:**
I wonder if that's true...

 
**Ruby:**
Well, I can't say for sure either.
But what will you do if it is?

 
**Ruby:**
When you get Miyu back, want to create the Land of Squee-Squee-Hee-Hee Love or something for the two of you?

 
**Ruby:**
I'll be willing to cooperate, heeheehee!

 
**Illya:**
Hey! What are you talking about, Ruby!? Sheesh...

 
**Illya:**
Ahhh, I wish Chloe were here at a time like this!

 
**Illya:**
...This is a weird world. It's cute on the surface, but I think there's more to it.

 
**Illya:**
We have to hurry up and find the owner of the Reality Marble. If we can do that, we should be able to find a clue as to Miyu's whereabouts.

 
## 3rei!! The Land of Dead Bookshelves I

**???:**
It can't be... Why... ?

 
**???:**
What... are you going on about...?

 
**???:**
Becoming a magical girl, one who makes everyone happy, was... your... dream... wasn't it?

 
**???:**
That's why... this was destined... to happen to me sooner or later...

 
**???:**
You musn't cry about it.

 
**???:**
But Mila... Without you, there's no way I can be... a magical girl!

Mila... Please... Don't die...

## 3rei!! The Land of Dead Bookshelves II
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We've finally made it to the next kingdom.
You're about to arrive at...

 
**Illya:**
I think it's the Land of Dead Bookshelves.
The two jewels keep showing this direction.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm... I'm not seeing any signs of life.
I guess the area lives up to its name.

 
**Mash:**
It's so quiet. It's not like the other lands we've been to.

 
**Mash:**
It's empty, but unlike the neutral zones, there's a sternness to it.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Illya, look. There's a huge black wall over there...

That appears to be a completely different area next to the Land of Dead Bookshelves.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It worries me that that I can't get any readings from beyond the wall.

That's strange. It feels deliberate, doesn't it?

Could there really be a magical girl in a place like this?

Roger. It doesn't seem like it wants to hurt us.

It left without doing anything. It seems to have headed for the black wall.

Looks like it was just wandering...

 
**Illya:**
Whew. That was scary.

But thanks, Mash.
For not hurting the ghost.

Illya...

 
**Mash:**
No, thank Senpai instead of me. Hehe.

 
**Mash:**
Are you worried about that ghost?

 
**Illya:**
Yeah. It was really scary... but it also seemed kind of sad.

 
**Mash:**
We're almost to the center of the ruins.
There's still nobody here.

I'll fly a little and look down from above!

A leyline directly linked to a parallel world?

So that's it. She found a foothold out to the outside world.

**Dr. Roman:**
(Whispering) I've never seen anything so bizarre.
No wonder I couldn't search inside...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, Mash, every book on that shelf is a grimoire.

 
**Mash:**
All of them!?

 
**Helena:**
Yes. For many years these ruins have been called the Land of Dead Bookshelves.

 
**Helena:**
I'll tell you why.

 
**Helena:**
The ghosts outside, as well as all the books in this room, they were once magical girls.

 
**Helena:**
This is the graveyard of those poor girls who were plunged into this world. They're called “Echoes.”

 
**Mash:**
Echoes... You mean the echoes of magical girls.
Jason used that word too.

 
**Helena:**
Jason? Of the Land of Dragons and Sea?
You're more adventurous than you look.

 
**Helena:**
Wasn't that place dangerous?
But don't worry, everyone here is peaceful.

 
**Helena:**
They just sleep here, in the form of grimoires.
Many magical girls liked to read.

 
**Helena:**
The Echoes who attacked you outside wanted someone to join them...

 
**Helena:**
Or perhaps they wanted to match spells with a rival, as they once did.

 
**Helena:**
The reason the Echoes don't attack me is because my role here is to serve guests.

 
**Helena:**
And I have the jewel that's a symbol of my role.
That's all.

Are you the owner of the Reality Marble?


---
 
**Helena:**
Me? No, that's not me. I don't own the Reality Marble.

 
**Helena:**
Then you're already aware that this world is inside a vast Reality Marble.

 
**Helena:**
This world was created by a single magical girl.
She's called the First Lady.

 
**Helena:**
That's what the Echoes whisper to me.
I've never met her myself.

 
**Helena:**
It's said that the First Lady is in a sealed space at the center of this world, beyond the black wall.

 
**Helena:**
No magic can destroy that black wall, and there's no way to know what's inside.

 
**Illya:**
Wait, then what about Medb?
The one from the Land of Snow and Honey?

 
**Helena:**
Medb is a magical girl. A very powerful one.
But she's not the First Lady.

 
**Helena:**
Illya, right? Tell me the rest of your story.
Why are you so focused on Medb?

 
**Helena:**
Don't tell me you're asking if it's okay to defeat her...

 
**Illya:**
N-No!
Actually...

 
**Helena:**
I see. A fellow magical girl was kidnapped.
That's a shame.

 
**Helena:**
But that's strange. Is that possible?

 
**Helena:**
I thought Medb wasn't interested in anything but the jewels. Did changes in the First Lady have an effect on Medb too?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'd like to ask a question too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You seem to know an awful lot about parallel worlds.

 
**Helena:**
Of course I do. Part of it is my knowledge of theosophy, but...

 
**Helena:**
We magical girls were originally invited here from many different parallel worlds.

 
**Helena:**
We were girls who, for various reasons, couldn't be magical girls in our own worlds anymore.

 
**Helena:**
We had no choice but to come here. We had nowhere else to go. Here, we could continue being magical girls.

 
**Helena:**
This is, in a sense, our paradise.
And it's the final stop on our journey.

The Throne of Heroic Spirits that's said to be a hall of records within the void? Unfortunately, it's nothing so noble and innocent as that.

They pathetically clung to being magical girls and fought until they ended up as mere ideas... as Echoes.

**Helena:**
It doesn't matter. At some point, Medb will come.

 
**Helena:**
I'm not a magical girl anymore. Just a gravekeeper.
I don't care about the power of the stone.

 
**Illya:**
But...

 
**Helena:**
There's no need to hesitate. After all, you will eventually meet the same fate.

 
**Helena:**
The time will come when the world will abandon you, Illya. When you lose your wish.

 
**Helena:**
I'll tell you the most important thing.
It's about your friend, Miyu Edelfelt.

 
**Helena:**
This is a guess, but I don't think it was Medb who kidnapped her. It was the First Lady.

 
**Helena:**
I've always assumed that she was silently monitoring this world from beyond the black wall...

 
**Helena:**
... by transforming her familiars to blend in with those of the other magical girls.

 
**Helena:**
If you ask Medb, you'll get closer to the truth.
That is, if she allows you to survive.

 
**Illya:**
Thank you Helena. Miyu was who I wanted to know about most!

 
**Illya:**
But I don't need the jewel.

 
**Helena:**
Even if you needed all the jewels to get beyond the black wall?

 
**Illya:**
What? All of them?

All the jewels?

**Dr. Roman:**
Wait. Are you saying we need to take the stones from all the magical girls, including Medb's?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The jewels have enough power to alter the First Lady's Reality Marble?

 
**Helena:**
Yes. The Echoes whispered to me...

 
**Helena:**
The jewels are crystallized emotions that grant wishes. They should be able to cross the wall, and even reach the outside world.

 
**Helena:**
But that may be part of what the First Lady wants, too. Even so, there's only one way to find out: get all the jewels.

 
**Ruby:**
See? It's just like I said.

 
**Ruby:**
Well, if my theory's right, the First Lady's familiars are capable of crossing the black wall.

 
**Ruby:**
I can't imagine her being dumb enough to let someone else take control of them, though.

 
**Illya:**
That means the First Lady is deliberately making the magical girls fight!

 
**Illya:**
That's awful! We have to stop her!
But how?

 
**Mash:**
I agree. We are a part of this fight, even if we didn't intend to be...

Yeah. It looks like the balance of the bounded field is collapsing.

Helena. What kind of magical girl is Connacht☆Medb?


---
 
**Helena:**
An intense woman.
She's a magical girl of blazing ice.

 
**Helena:**
Fierce and merciless. A giant mass of possessiveness. Her rigid nature is like a castle that molds her.

 
**Helena:**
She holds the reins of all kinds of contradictions, tightly knotted together.

If the root of a magical girl's power lies in her strength to believe in herself, she must be the strongest one.

Does that mean...she's almost insane?


---
 
**Helena:**
Medb? Of course not. Her sanity is beyond doubt.
She's absolutely in her right mind.

 
**Helena:**
Perhaps she was the only decent one among the rest of us.

 
**Helena:**
In this warped world, she was probably the only person who managed to keep being herself till the end.

 
**Helena:**
She had been in this world since before I arrived.
There was a time when we journeyed together...

 
**Helena:**
But I put some distance between us when she became obsessed with her lust for control.

 
**Helena:**
After that, she dialed up on her madness.
Or maybe I'm just flattering myself thinking that.

 
**Helena:**
Most likely, she hadn't changed.
Not at all.

 
**Illya:**
Helena...

 
**Illya:**
Medb said she was ready to accept me as a member of her invincible army.

 
**Illya:**
That's why I mistakenly thought Miyu had been abducted by her.

 
**Helena:**
The formation of Little Witch Codes to rebel against the First Lady's rule. That was her idea.

So she hasn't given up on that ambition yet.

Yes, they are! Those are the snowfield-specialized hostiles!

That's impossible. We're still on constant alert here. Maybe there was a change in the surrounding environment?

They're coming straight toward us!
Doesn't look like talking would do any good... (Gulp)

I'm sorry, but I'm not going to fight.

I may be with you guys, that doesn't make me want to directly stand up against Medb.

Unfortunately, it's too soon to be relieved.
Chaldea has been attacked.

It is happening. Using our Leyline connection, they sent several hostiles over!

That's right. We were apparently hacked.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The disconnection you experienced a short while ago was intentional.

We barely managed to deal with the enemies that attacked us thanks to some on-call Servants, but we can't keep this up.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, Mash, I need you both to return immediately.

 
**Mash:**
So that means...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That said, knowing Mash and Fujimaru,

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure you two won't say yes so easily.
I know that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I still need you to understand this is an urgent matter.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
For now, I'll cut the connection again, to prevent any effects from your side.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I will contact you again in five minutes.
Make a decision by then.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...

 
**Illya:**
Oh...

 
**Illya:**
It's snow. It's starting to snow.

 
**Helena:**
From what I observed of Medb's familiars and of our surroundings during battle...

 
**Helena:**
I can tell that Medb has started to unleash considerable forces to attack surrounding lands.

 
**Mash:**
I can't believe we've endangered Chaldea... I don't know what to say...

 
**Ruby:**
Sorry to interrupt your pity-party, Mash, but you should probably deactivate your transformation.

 
**Mash:**
What? Why, Ruby? We've just finished a battle.
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

 
**Ruby:**
The magical energy that you're using to be a Demi-Servant is completely dependent on your Master at the moment.

 
**Ruby:**
We don't know what will happen from here on, so I think you should be in energy-saving mode as much as you can.

 
**Ruby:**
If we need to act fast against something, Illya and I can handle it.

 
**Illya:**
Yeah. That's right, Ruby. You do have something useful to say sometimes.

 
**Illya:**
You can trust us, Mash!

 
**Mash:**
That's true. So this is what happens... when the connection with Chaldea is shut down.

 
**Mash:**

**Mash:**

**Helena:**
As the longest inhabitant of this world, I agree with Fujimaru's opinion.

 
**Helena:**
Running back to your parallel world as it is now will not fundamentally solve this issue.

 
**Helena:**
The threat will not go away on its own.
This irregular state of danger will continue.

 
**Mash:**
And with Chaldea at risk, it certainly sounds like we need to resolve this.

 
**Mash:**
But are you really okay with that, Senpai? That means that we're going to continue accompanying Illya, right?

 
**Mash:**
Well, I mean, I'm not complaining at all!
I am also happy to help you, Illya.

 
**Illya:**
I... Um, I... Fujimaru, Mash...

 
**Illya:**

**Dr. Roman:**
All right, let me hear your decision.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's going on there? Mash, your face's all red.
Oh, are you mad?

 
**Helena:**
Guess what? They were making a big deal discussing a primitive way to charge magical energy.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm? A magical energy recharge method with the contractor?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The contract made between Mash and Fujimaru was an irregular case, but...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
As always, no special ceremony should be necessary. If you consume an extreme amount of magical energy, just use a Command Spell.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But don't we have something much more crucial to discuss right now? Pertaining to the survival of Chaldea?

 
## 4ier!!! The Land of Snow and Honey III
 
**Illya:**
Dr. Romani looked disappointed.

 
**Illya:**
This is all our fault. I'm sorry.

 
**Mash:**
No, there's no need for you to be sorry. Romani Archaman is Chaldea's current commander in charge.

 
**Mash:**
If he felt there was real danger, he would have forced us to transport back.

 
**Mash:**
He didn't do that, which means the doctor understands how important this matter is as well.

Anyway, until the next planned contact, we will have no method of communicating with Chaldea.

Gentle Bite Coinchenn!

 
**Mini Cú:**
No hard feelings, little girl.
Medb wanted you for her army.

The more you desire, the more thirsty you become.
That's greed. Now, sorry, but...

Illya! Ruby! I'm sorry I'm late!

**Ruby:**
Good timing, Sapphire! Make a temporary contract with Mash over there!

 
**Sapphire:**
She must be Illya's ally. Understood.

 
**Sapphire:**
Please excuse me.

 
**Mash:**
My! I feel kind of strange.

 
**Mini Cú:**
Hm. You've become a lot like a magical girl all of a sudden.

 
**Mini Cú:**
That means my fun ends here.
I guess I'll retreat.

 
**Helena:**
You do that, Cú. And go tell Medb...

 
**Helena:**
That Illya already has two of the jewels.

 
**Mini Cú:**
Yeah, I could tell by the smell.
There's one in your pocket too.

 
**Mini Cú:**
Got it. Sounds like a sweet situation Medb would be happy about.

 
**Sapphire:**
First, please see this. It's a message from Miyu.

 
**Miyu:**
(Panting)

 
**Illya:**
Miyu!

 
**Ruby:**
Ohh! (Sob) Miyu, what a humiliating position you are in!

 
**Ruby:**
However, this bondage thing is somewhat sexy, like...
Ack! Ow, ow, ow, I give up! I give up!

 
**Miyu:**
Illya. Or to anyone who knows of Illya.

 
**Miyu:**
I am Miyu... Edelfelt.
I am a m-magical girl...

 
**Illya:**
(I guess Miyu is a little embarrassed too.)

 
**Miyu:**
I came to this world with Illya.

 
**Miyu:**
I am a prisoner of the First Lady.
It was she who created this Reality Marble.

 
**Miyu:**
Inside the black wall, located in the center of the Reality Marble, is the First Lady's castle.

 
**Miyu:**
Only one of her familiars can pass through the black wall.

 
**Miyu:**
Medb, the woman who attacked me and Illya, was also unable to penetrate the wall.

 
**Mash:**
Queen Medb was eyeing Miyu from the beginning, too.

 
**Miyu:**
The First Lady is probably the reason why we've been lured into this world.

 
**Miyu:**
She seems to have found technology that could interfere with parallel universes.

 
**Miyu:**
I don't think it's for a peaceful purpose.
There must be a connection with why I'm held captive.

 
**Miyu:**
We must do something. We must stop her plan.

 
**Miyu:**
This castle is like a labyrinth of mirrors.
The familiars have established a solid defense as well.

 
**Miyu:**
Still, I believe Sapphire will be able to escape and guide you here.

 
**Miyu:**
But... if... it's you, Illya...

 
**Miyu:**
Illya, you musn't come. Find someone to help you.
Have them come instead.

 
**Illya:**
What!? What are you saying, Miyu!?
Why do you always...

 
**Helena:**
Now, now. It's just a recording.
Calm down.

 
**Miyu:**
The patrolling familiar is back!

 
**Miyu:**
Sapphire, go now! And please be safe!

 
**Illya:**
... (Gloomy)

 
**Mash:**
Oh no, Illya is extremely depressed...

 
**Sapphire:**
Illya. Miyu is waiting for you.

 
**Sapphire:**
Please don't be upset. I shall help as well.

 
**Illya:**
Yeah, you're right. Thank you, Sapphire.
I'm glad to see you again safe and sound.

 
**Sapphire:**
Yes. I should be with Miyu at all times, yet I returned alone. I truly regret this!

 
**Sapphire:**
And the ones from Chaldea. I don't know how to thank you for protecting Illya.

 
**Sapphire:**
Please, I beg you... Save Miyu!

 
**Ruby:**
According to Sapphire, who sneaked inside the castle...

 
**Ruby:**
Even though Sapphire is away from Miyu, Miyu's transformation never lifted.

 
**Ruby:**
The First Lady must have special powers over magical girls.

 
**Ruby:**
This is dangerous! I am worried about Miyu too!

Sister. No further.

 
**Illya:**
Wait, what are you talking about?

 


---
 
**Illya:**
But... Hey, Sapphire... Why did Miyu say something like that?

 
**Illya:**
That I shouldn't come...

 
**Sapphire:**
I do not know either.

 
**Sapphire:**
However, it seems that Miyu noticed something regarding the First Lady's true identity.

 
**Sapphire:**
That was probably why she worried for you, Illya.

The First Lady's true identity?

Do you know anything about it, Helena?


---
 
**Helena:**
...We've made a few guesses.

 
**Helena:**
The First Lady... The owner of this entire magical girl Reality Marble.

 
**Helena:**
She is said to be the very first magical girl.

 
**Helena:**
Just as the King of Heroes originates the existences of the many other heroes who illuminate human history...

 
**Helena:**
...so too was there someone who first defined the concept of “magical girl.”

 
**Helena:**
I have spoken with Medb about such things in the past.

 
**Illya:**
Huh? Do you know, Ruby?

 
**Ruby:**
Uhhhhh... I just know that this is a dangerous topic!

 
**Ruby:**
By that logic, we are just imitations that have been continuously copied...

 
**Ruby:**
...so we would be at a great disadvantage in magecraft and the like!

 
**Ruby:**
Hehehehe, Ruby is getting fired up!

 
**Sapphire:**
That's my sister.

 
**Illya:**
Haha. That's heartening, but I'm still worried.

 
**Mash:**
However...

 
**Mash:**
Is that the real reason Miyu tried to keep Illya away?

 
## 4ier!!! The Land of Snow and Honey IV
 
**Helena:**
I'm staying here.

 
**Helena:**
She knows we're coming, so Medb will be waiting with everything she's got.

 
**Illya:**
Helena.

 
**Helena:**
There's no making peace or compromising with Medb.

 
**Helena:**
Defeat or be defeated, that's all there is with Medb.

 
**Helena:**
I just... I don't want to see any more magical girls fall.

 
**Illya:**
I understand!

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru, are you okay with that?

**Helena:**
You're already the owner.
If you don't need it, bring it back to me.

 
**Helena:**
I may have guided you here, but... you know.

 
**Helena:**
I may not look it, but I care about my friends.

Yeah. I know that, of course!

And the Chaldea Master and Servant, too.
That's you, right?

It was only for a moment, but I took a peek inside your world through the familiar I sent.

It was so boring! So boring!

And that's where you're wrong. You're arrogant enough to think you can save the world all by yourselves.

You just want an excuse. You just want to say that you tried to fight back. You'll never really rule your own fate.

**Medb:**
It's fine. In the end, you're just fake magical girls.
You're not worthy of my army.

 
**Medb:**
The one I really want is you, Illya!
Are you ready to join me?

 
**Medb:**
Those two are probably secretly trying to take over your world.

 
**Illya:**
Medb... No.
They're not like you!

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru would never do that!

 
**Medb:**
Are you sure?

 
**Medb:**
They seem very interested in knowing what they could use you for.

 
**Illya:**
Uhhhngh!

 
**Medb:**
Heheh...

 
**Medb:**
You want to save your friend, right?
Miyu, was it?

 
**Medb:**
Fine. I'll help you.

 
**Medb:**
But I want you and Miyu to both join me. We'll make this Chaldea pair our slaves.

 
**Mini Cú:**
It's fine to be greedy about things that don't matter.
But don't get too greedy when it counts, Medb.

 
**Mini Cú:**
Kill them. They're worthless to be slaves. They may not look it, but they're no different than Spartacus.

 
**Medb:**
Oh, Mini Cú! Even shrunken down you're still so cold and cruel!♡

 
**Medb:**
But I'm not going to listen to you.
I'm the queen. I decide who lives and who dies.

 
**Illya:**
But Medb, aren't you obeying the First Lady?

 
**Mash:**
Illya?

 
**Medb:**
Oh? I'm interested where you got that idea.
I want you even more now.

 
**Medb:**
Yes, that's right. I was. But things are different now.

 
**Medb:**
The First Lady's dream is my wish.
Her pain is my suffering.

 
**Medb:**
The First Lady. The first one to fall into this world.
The first curse.

 
**Medb:**
The black queen who brought light and guidance to this chaotic world. But she can't leave her castle. She can't leave this world.

 
**Medb:**
She's all alone... The poor little queen of black.

 
**Medb:**
But I no longer feel respect nor pity!

You're the one who's pink!

 
**Mini Cú:**
...Sheesh. You lost because you wasted time on cheesy jokes, idiot.

 
**Mini Cú:**
It's not like you to be careful and orderly with your invasions. Normally you would've just dove right into the main dish from the get-go.

 
**Mini Cú:**
You had just a little bit of sympathy for the fates of your fellow magical girls, and that's why you lost, Medb.

 
**Medb:**
Tch! Don't be stupid! That's too much, even coming from you, my lovely Mini Cú...!

 
**Mini Cú:**
Huh? Normally I'm your enemy. Our relationship was as that we'd hang out together as enemies.

I mean, your mean-spiritness was always so cool!

Right, whatever. You're weird.

 
**Medb:**
Anyway, take back what you said a minute ago!
I'm a queen! I don't care about the other magical girls!

 
**Medb:**
I get saved, I get satisfied, I'm cute, and I'm the most important!

What's with that look? Like you're seeing something strange... Who do you think you are!?

 
**Illya:**
No, um... What you said just surprised me.

 
**Illya:**
But I think that Mr. Mini Cú is right.
Medb must have been a great queen.

 
**Medb:**
Huh? What did you say?

 
**Illya:**
Because of what you just said.

 
**Illya:**
“I get saved, I get satisfied, I'm cute, and I'm the most important!”

 
**Illya:**
I think that's also what Nursery and Medea wanted.

 
**Illya:**

Huh? That's...!

 
**Helena:**
I feel a great flow of magical energy...

 
**Helena:**
The magical energy that filled this world is gathering where the First Lady is.

 
**Helena:**
Does she have a vessel capable of holding all that magical power?

Master, if we're on schedule, then now...

**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, you're all looking good!
I was worried, but I'm glad you're safe!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Where's Illya and Ruby?
D-Don't tell me...

 
**Mash:**
They're both fine. We also met up with Ruby's little sister, Sapphire.

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, tell us what is happening there!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Little sister? A Mystic Code has a little sister?
No, I can't think about it now. We're in a hurry.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I had a meeting with Da Vinci and we came up with an engineering solution.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That world is very dangerous.
But we've become very involved with it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
At this point, we're a part of this too.
We can't just ignore it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And personally, I can't just leave Illya when she needs help.

 
**Mash:**
Does that mean Chaldea is going to provide us full operational support?

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's right!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course, personally I'm extremely interested in that grotesque... I mean, strange world.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That space should normally be... hmm... I guess you could call it a dumping ground for thoughts and feelings.

 
**Helena:**
You don't need to be so careful with your words. Yes. This place is purgatory itself.

 
**Helena:**
This is a dumping ground for magical girls who dreamed an endless dream, and failed to reach it!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Brava! All right, no need to explain!

 
**Mash:**
It's not wonderful! Nothing is all right!

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, this is good! It's very good!
A magical girl is an extremely unstable being.

 
**Da Vinci:**
They have overwhelming magical energy, and sometimes can use magecraft intuitively, and without the proper rituals.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But for those who lose their possibilities and give in to despair, their obsession becomes a flow of unformed magical energy.

 
**Da Vinci:**
A stagnant pool forming in a chaotic waste dump.

 
**Da Vinci:**
The First Lady became the locus of those chaotic thoughts and feelings, and the Reality Marble formed mostly on its own.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I assume that's about what happened.

 
**Helena:**
Are you... a genius?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course I am. I apologize.
I should've told you so earlier.

 
**Mash:**
Then that means...

**Da Vinci:**
That's right! That's what I'm after, you see!
It's the best way to solve the root problem here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But I don't know what that active magical girl with you will think. Or the residents of that world.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Man, you can be harsh. Though that may be the most realistic solution.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But let me say one thing.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You guys have done all kinds of things that I thought were impossible.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You can't make a miracle happen if you're worried about safety, efficiency, or a plan B.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you've made it this far, you should do what you want to do.

Yes. That's what the Doctor and Da Vinci said.

So they cut off all normal communications and are on standby for our request to return home.

What do you mean, “come home!?” It's so smooth that it's hard to run!

 
**Illya:**
That being said, if we flew, we'd be easy pickings for her familiars!

True☆ And down here, the twinkling ground acts like a mirror, so good job!

 
**Illya:**
Hey, d-don't look!

 
**Sapphire:**
Illya, Ruby, this is no time for fooling around.
Miyu is waiting for us.

 
**Illya:**
T-That's right! (Sweat)
That must be the First Lady's castle!

 
**Helena:**
As we get closer to the castle, the sticks are shifting form... The familiars are getting stronger!

 
**Mash:**
The First Lady is reacting to our presence, trying to keep us from coming closer.

Yes. It has something to do with the jewels we've been gathering. That's my guess.

 
**Mash:**
You mean it was the First Lady herself who disengaged the black wall? Not the power of the four jewels?

 
**Mash:**
Does that mean she has been intentionally pitting the magical girls against each other from this isolated space?

It's contradictory. As if two wills are at war with each other.

Either way, to learn her true motive, we'll just have to ask the First Lady herself.

Though you did see through my lie at the neutral zone. That's right. Right now, I have my own stone, so I can fight to some extent.

Still, I'm not your Servant.
I'm here as a magical girl and that's all.

I'm surprised by how much spirit you've shown.
Before, I looked down on you as a fake magical girl.

Tradition, experience, knowledge... It's far from those secrets of magecraft, but I realize again just how much power you have.

I'm a half-baked magical girl who couldn't become someone's hope, or even an Echo.

Therefore, like you said, at least let me have the spotlight for this scene.

I finally managed to drive them off.

 
**Helena:**
Oh, I forgot to tell them. Well, to be honest, I didn't want to tell them.

 
**Helena:**
For Illya and the others to return to their original world, they need the jewels.

I'm not going to give them my stone, but as long as Illya and Miyu have two, it should be plenty.

Medb accidentally proved that. I finally understand the meaning of that accursed stone...

Are you talking to yourself?
Or is that a prayer, Helena?

Al. I didn't intend to summon you.

Not to mention, your prized DC is thoroughly rusty.

Don't compare me with any AC stuff! DC is eternal!

 
**Mini Edison:**
My role is to support your activities, invest in you, and be happy about it! Now is the time to open your mystic grimoire!

I was actually with you.

You two were in a hurry to get something there, so it seems you didn't notice my presence.

Flustered, I did a little tuning and jumped into the Reality Marble. In retrospect, that probably wasn't a good idea.

The next thing I knew, I was in this world.
And all alone.

 
**Illya:**
You were here... before us?
In this world?

 
**Chloe:**
That's right. Ever since, I've been alone here.
Like a time warp from the unstable jump?

 
**Chloe:**
When I looked out over this world, I saw magical girls at war with each other, and I didn't know which were allies.

 
**Chloe:**
Even just concealing my presence consumed more and more of my magical energy.

It got to the point where I almost disappeared.

Because I was hoping that Rin or Luvia would come and save us.

But since they didn't notice I was gone in the first place, of course they didn't come to save me.

But...that wasn't it. My appearance in this world was inevitable.

The First Lady told me something. She was brutally honest. It was like a knife sliding through my ribs.

“Is the meaning of your life to be an accessory to Illya? You're like a wildcat that's been declawed.” That's what she said.

Tanned skin and pale eyes are great charm points!
 
**Chloe:**
Wha... Huh!?

 
**Illya:**
T-That's right! Beautiful tanned...
That's not the point!

 
**Illya:**
Chloe, I'm the one who idolizes you! You're strong and have your act together infinitely more than me!

 
**Chloe:**
That's not what I'm talking about. I don't think you'll ever be able to understand it, Illya.

**Chloe:**
But even I have a wish that I want to come true.

 
**Chloe:**
For my sake alone. My own wish that would reach the world.

 
**Illya:**
Chloe is... projecting a weapon!

 
**Ruby:**
Oh my. This is definitely battle mode, isn't it?

 
**Illya:**
Oh, Chloe, how could you!?

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru, Mash, and Sapphire too, please!

 
**Illya:**
Please give me just a little time!

**Mash:**
A full throttle magic combat with the sisters' supremacy on the line... I'm kind of captiva... N-No!

 
**Mash:**
If it becomes dangerous, I'm going to stop you both!

**Illya:**
Thank you.
Ruby!

 
**Ruby:**
Yes☆ Can I punch the mischievous Chloe once?

 
**Sapphire:**
Come on, there's not a moment to lose.
Let's just use my brainwashing device...

 
**Illya:**
No! I'm going to turn off the switch that made her weird!

 
**Ruby:**
Yeah, yeah☆ Beat her with your conviction, right?
I know full well what you're going to do!

 
**Ruby:**
But I also think you should apologize to her later for neglecting her.

 
**Illya:**
Ulp...
Any way, get away from Miyu, Chloe!

 
**Chloe:**
Forget it! Miyu is mine now!

 
## World End Match: First Lady
 
**Chloe:**
(Panting)

 
**Chloe:**
I guess it's hard for us to have a decisive showdown, Illya...

 
**Chloe:**
There's a limit to how much I can bear my shared pain with you.

 
**Illya:**
Chloe!? What's wrong? Your body...!

 
**Chloe:**
Isn't it obvious? It's the First Lady.

 
**Chloe:**
She doesn't just want Miyu. She wants you, too.
Who knew there was someone greedier than me.

 
**Illya:**
W-What are you talking about, Chloe!?

 
**Mash:**
Chloe. It was the First Lady's idea to abduct Miyu, wasn't it?

 
**Chloe:**
I'm not...sure about that...

 
**Illya:**
Chloe? Chloe!?

 
**Chloe:**
Unhhh... Wait, not yet... Stop... it...!

 
**E：???:**
As promised... I waited until after your duel with Illya, Chloe.

 
**E：???:**
As a vessel, you are impeccable.
However, it seems you fall short of Illya's heart.

 
**Mash:**
Chloe's body... Even her voice has changed completely!

The First Lady...!?


---
 
**E：First Lady:**
That's right. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I am the First Lady. The first magical girl.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Shall I introduce myself further? Perhaps in an amiable, courteous way, as befits a magical girl?

 
**E：First Lady:**
I was born in the Demon World, but raised in the human world.

 
**E：First Lady:**
I hid my identity and fought for people. But because of that, I lost my homeland and was forgotten by both humans and my brethren in the Demon World.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Now no one knows who I am. There is no longer anyone around who will call my name.

 
**E：First Lady:**
But I didn't hate humans or my brethren. I definitely didn't sink to the level of becoming a witch.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Right now, my only desire is to keep making girls' wishes come true.

 
**E：First Lady:**
I want to spread the magic of magical girls... of love and hope... throughout the world.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Those feelings attracted Echoes to this Reality Marble.

Are you an Echo?
 
**E：First Lady:**
Yes. Until Chloe came here, I suppose my existence was ephemeral like that.

 
**E：First Lady:**
To form and sustain this Reality Marble, I needed to have an invisible presence.

 
**E：First Lady:**
I gave the girls temporary bodies and magical energy to act as materials for them to create towns, castles, and kingdoms in this world.

 
**E：First Lady:**
But it wasn't the same. To really make my wish come true, I needed a real magical girl. That's where Chloe came in.

Why did you set the magical girls on each other?
 
**E：First Lady:**
Ah... I regret that.

 
**E：First Lady:**
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
It's too late now, though.

 
**E：First Lady:**
There's not enough space! This Reality Marble isn't big enough for all of us.

 
**E：First Lady:**
That's why I won't let you interfere.
We need another world!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Why did you need Chloe?

 
**E：First Lady:**
Why did Chloe appear before me?

 
**E：First Lady:**
It doesn't matter. That's not the issue. I have no intention of letting this opportunity get away from me.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Yes Mash, that's why I reached out to you as well, an employee of Chaldea.

 
**E：First Lady:**
With Miyu, I can do it. I can give all of the Echoes new incarnations.

 
**E：First Lady:**
And not inside this empty cage that is this Reality Marble, but in the real world.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Infinite parallel worlds host infinite crises. That's where you'll find real enemies who need to be defeated.

 
**E：First Lady:**
There are miserable people who sincerely need magical girls!!

 
**E：First Lady:**
Hence the Little Witch Codes... Nay, Prisma Codes!

 
**E：First Lady:**
We'll race to even the farthest parallel worlds!
Because my wish will come true!

 
**Illya:**
This is...

 
**Illya:**
Just like Medb... No, this is different... It's more evil... Darker...

 
**Ruby:**
Exactly. And she still tells herself that the means justify the end.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Illya... You would deny me my one and only, non-negotiable wish.

 
**E：First Lady:**
After seeing the way you behaved towards the magical girls of this world, I finally realized that.

 
**E：First Lady:**
I will allow no interference.
Soon, I will absorb Miyu.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Miyu is a stubborn one. And Chloe, who's already a part of me, resists assimilation even now. She is a truly disobedient girl.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Even so, it's only a matter of time.

 
**Illya:**
Ms. Lady...

 
**Illya:**
I can tell that you believe in the magical girls.
But there's one thing I know.

 
**Illya:**
No wish is worth sacrificing Miyu!

 
**Illya:**
And not only Miyu! Chloe, too.
Chloe is my precious other half!

---
 
**E：First Lady:**
Is it because I'm an Echo? Nothing more than an echo that doesn't resonate within anyone's heart?

Deep down, everyone has their own magical girl.
 
**Illya:**
How could you say a crazy line like that with a straight face!?

 
**Mash:**
B-but that sounds a little... like you are trying to cheer up the First Lady!

 


---
 
**Illya:**
Ms. Lady, you are my Senpai as a magical girl, and a major Senpai at that.

 
**Illya:**
But that's even more reason for not being able to overlook this. If you're making a mistake, I have to tell you so.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Heeheeheehee.

 
**E：First Lady:**
The same thing. Chloe told me the same thing.
And now you too!

 
**E：First Lady:**
Do you really want to consign me to the past that badly?

 
**E：First Lady:**
When I can save the world... When I can become queen...

 
**E：First Lady:**
Illya, eventually, so could you.

 
**Illya:**
Listen to me, First Lady! Your wish would only turn into a curse!

 
**Illya:**
We magical girls are always getting involved in half-baked, outrageous trouble.

 
**Illya:**
But even so, there are good things...
Wait? ...Were there good things? Um...

 
**Ruby:**
Excuse me, Illya? At this point, you should be completely candid.

 
**Illya:**
Ah, t-that's right! There are moments where I thought it was a good thing!

 
**Illya:**
I got to meet Miyu, whom I just love. And with Chloe,
I got a sassy yet dependable little sister.

 
**Illya:**
With Ruby, Sapphire, Rin, and Luvia, I had reservations at first...

 
**Illya:**
...but they've become dear friends for whom I could give up everything.

 
**Illya:**
That's the best treasure of all, isn't it?

 
**E：First Lady:**
I had friends, too. But the world abandoned me.

 
**Illya:**
Huh?

 
**E：First Lady:**
Fujimaru, what about you?

 
**E：First Lady:**
I suspect you actually want to be forgotten. Perhaps that's the kind of person you are.

 
**E：First Lady:**
But... what would you do if you could save the world?

 
**E：First Lady:**
Right now, it's tougher and more painful than ever before and you want to run away, but you're still alive, right?

 
**E：First Lady:**
The moment you save the world, you would die.

 
**E：First Lady:**
And Mash Kyrielight, what about you?

 
**E：First Lady:**
Will your bond with Fujimaru last forever?
Really?

 
**E：First Lady:**
Would you be able to endure if you were abandoned?

 
**E：First Lady:**
If you could be with your Master for eternity, would you cling to that hope?

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
No. That isn't hope.

 
**Mash:**
Ms. Lady, you're very hurt.
No one was able to heal or protect you.

 
**Mash:**
You've fought cruel destiny all this time, haven't you?
I respect you. I definitely don't pity you.

 
**Mash:**
It's a miracle that you and I met. I won't forget you.
Even if you forget me.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Ah... You... lie... That's ...a lie!

 
**Miyu:**
... Ill... ya...

 
**Illya:**
Miyu! You've come to!

 
**Sapphire:**
Miyu!

 
**Miyu:**
Help... The First Lady... Help Chloe...

 
**Miyu:**
Her words... are false... She's hiding a wish... that won't come true deep in her heart...

 
**Miyu:**
Please... She's crying on the inside. Take her hand... Just as Illya... Just as you did for me...

 
**Illya:**
Okay. Hold on just a little longer, Miyu!

 
**Miyu:**
Also... um...

 
**Illya:**
Huh? W-What?

 
**Miyu:**
Being with Chloe all this time... It's been awkward...

 
**Miyu:**
I mean, not knowing what to talk about... But silence is... painful...

 
**Illya:**
Huh?

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Excuse me, what was that!? When I'm doing everything I can in here to fight her!!

 
**Illya:**
Oh, Chloe's back.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
I tried to be on my best behavior with you! So if you've got something to say about me, say it to my face! Oh, you're such a pain!

 
**Mash:**
D-Don't, Chloe!
If you show hatred towards Miyu.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Oh, shoot...! Come on... Illya, do something!

 
**Miyu:**
Ah... I'm... sorry...

 
**E：First Lady:**
Heh... Heh-heh...

 
**E：First Lady:**
By seeking out Miyu, Chloe and I have become one.

 
**E：First Lady:**
Thanks to that, I've broken through Chloe's mental wall. Now I can fight with all my might in this body!

 
**E：First Lady:**
Once I defeat all of you in front of Miyu, her last emotional support will crumble, and I will reach infinite worlds!

 
**Illya:**
And then, when you get to those worlds, what are you going to sacrifice next?

 
**Illya:**
After all, Miyu's fighting you.
And I can't lose!

 
**Illya:**
Because the magical girls of Kaleid are two people in one!

 
**Ruby:**
That's right! Now I'm moved, too!

 
**Sapphire:**
Illya, everyone, please!

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru! Mash!

 
**Illya:**
Please, just one more time! Let's fight together!

Despite wielding amazing power and beset by their own despair, they refused to walk away.

With magical girls, I'm sure they don't get all of their strength from using magic!

What!? W-Wait a second, Ms. Lady!

Just hang in there a little more!

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Don't say it like it's nothing... It's not that easy...

If you don't finish me off... You won't win.

 
**First Lady:**
I'll never give up... I can't give up...

 
**Illya:**
It's not about winning or losing, Ms. Lady.

 
**Miyu:**
That's right. It's not.

 
**Miyu:**
What you're doing isn't about obsession, or ideals.
It's about atonement.

 
**Miyu:**
First Lady, you just can't accept it.
What you have is different from Illya's pure feelings.

 
**Illya:**
M-Miyu...

 
**Miyu:**
Illya, tell her how you feel.

 
**Illya:**
What? Me!?

 
**Miyu:**
Yes. Tell her everything. Honestly.
So that it will reach her heart.

 
**Illya:**
Got it, Miyu.

 
**First Lady:**
...

 
**Illya:**
Ms. Lady... I-I...

 
**Illya:**
I'm always so busy dealing with what's going on around me... So I've never thought about saving the world...

 
**Illya:**
No, to be honest, I forced myself to think it had nothing to do with me because things were far away.

 
**Illya:**
But if I was in your place, Ms. Lady...

 
**Illya:**
If I had such an incredible power that it became my duty to help people who relied on me...

 
**Illya:**
I wouldn't know what I'd do... Or who I would chose.

 
**First Lady:**
...I see.

 
**Illya:**
But, if my friends and family that I love were in danger, I'd use my magic without hesitation.

 
**Illya:**
I'd use my magic to protect everyone's smiles.

 
**First Lady:**
Even if it meant that you yourself had to cry?

 
**Illya:**
...(Nod)

 
**First Lady:**
Illya... I'm jealous of you.

 
**First Lady:**
But at the same time, I think you're foolish.
It's like looking at the old me.

 
**First Lady:**
I couldn't save... the friend I cared about...

 
**First Lady:**
I had to choose between her and the world and I chose...the world.

 
**First Lady:**
I couldn't save... my best... friend...

 
**Mash:**
That's...

 
**Miyu:**
...

 
**Illya:**
You sacrificed... your friend?
Was she a magical girl, too?

 
**First Lady:**
...No.

 
**First Lady:**
She refused to be a magical girl. She became an enemy of the world, and brought despair to everyone.

 
**First Lady:**
That's why I... I had to stop her... myself...

 
**First Lady:**
I'll never see her again... I couldn't tell her... that I was sorry!

 
**Illya:**
...

 
**Helena:**
I don't know about that.

 
**Mash:**
...!?

 
**Illya:**
Helena!?

 
**Illya:**
Helena! And Mr. Lion, too!?

 
**Helena:**
Yes. I unfortunately survived. Just like the First Lady? No, that's not right.

 
**Helena:**
Not only did I fail to become something, I failed to die, too. I really fail at everything, don't I?

 
**Mini Edison:**
Don't worry, self-deprecation is a habit of hers.
Just ignore her.

 
**Helena:**
Al...! Keep your mouth shut...

 
**Helena:**
When your battle started for real, the First Lady's familiars ceased to be a threat.

 
**Helena:**
It was tough just getting to this throne room.
The barriers on this castle are too strong, and she can't get in.

 
**Helena:**
If Miyu's okay, let's take the First Lady and go outside.

 
**Helena:**
While we move, can you tell me about the girl the First Lady is possessing?

 
**Mash:**
Of course, but who is “she”?

 
**Illya:**
Eeee...!

 
**Illya:**
Are you that ghost from before?

 
**Mash:**
What are you doing here?

 
**Helena:**
This Echo is probably the one that was often wandering around the black wall.

 
**Helena:**
After the wall fell, I found her heading for the castle.

 
**Helena:**
Wait a minute, First Lady, do you know her?

 
**Helena:**
She looks like she wants to say something to you.

 
**First Lady:**
...

 
**Echo:**
...!

 
**Illya:**
It looks like she's really mad.

 
**Illya:**
She trying to tell the First Lady something?
But I don't know what she's saying!

 
**Illya:**
Ruby, can't you do something?

 
**Ruby:**
Just leave it to me! Try my special ghost medium potion! Here! (Stab)  
 
**Illya:**
Oooh!

 
**Mash:**
She didn't even ask for permission!

 
**Helena:**
Did the ghost really posess her? That was easy. I know it's redundant to say it, but that Mystic Code has some crazy functions.

 
**Miyu:**
Well... Illya? I mean, Ghost?

 
**First Lady:**
...

 
**???:**
...ou...

 
**???:**
...You...

 
**???:**
You... dummy!

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Oww...She just hit me! What was that for...?

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Ow! That really hurt...!

 
**Ruby:**
Oh-ho? The defensive response brought Chloe halfway back.

Were you here the whole time, Mila?
And I just didn't notice?

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
That's right. I'm just a shadowy Echo.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Without borrowing Illya's body, I can't maintain my consciousness.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
But I always felt your presence, because this world is the manifestation of your regrets.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
That's why I always wished I could go beyond the black wall, so that I could bring peace to your heart.

 
**Helena:**
...!?

 
**Helena:**
Mila, you were the one who opened a Leyline outside the Reality Marble!

 
**Helena:**
It wasn't a coincidence that summoned Chloe to this world. Mila, it was your wish.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
I'm not aware of that, but... If I did, I apologize.
I caused you a lot of trouble.

 
**Mash:**
T-Then what about my sleepwalking at Chaldea?

That was probably Medb.

Yes. That was her doing.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
For a very brief moment, Medb's power rivaled mine.

Was that the First Lady's doing too?
 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
No, that was Medb.

 


---
 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Medb used her vast magical energy to open up a Leyline.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
I just tried to use that opened Leyline.

 
**Mash:**
I see.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
The pressure from the First Lady feels like it's about to disappear...

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
At this rate, no matter how much I hold back, she's going to be pushed out.

 
**Miyu:**
Helena, how are you doing?

 
**Helena:**
I don't feel a change yet.

 
**Helena:**
But something's already happening in the Land of Dead Bookshelves. I can feel it through the jewel.

 
**Helena:**
The collapse is probably starting at the lands furthest from the First Lady's castle.

 
**Mash:**
So the Reality Marble can't sustain itself after all...

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Illya, Chloe, Miyu. I'm sorry for getting you caught up in the collapse of the Reality Marble.

 
**Miyu:**
There has to be something we can do...!

 
**Miyu:**
No, I don't care what happens to me.
But...

 
**Helena:**
First Lady, may I take over the Reality Marble from you?

 
**Miyu:**
The Reality Marble? Is that possible?

 
**Helena:**
Unfortunately, I'm serious.

 
**Helena:**
This world is needed as a place for wounded magical girls to go.

 
**Helena:**
It's not a nice way to say it, but it's the same way you need a soldier's home for wounded soldiers.

 
**Helena:**
No, forget that example. It makes me think a dangerous antibacterial magical girl might show up.

 
**Helena:**
Anyway. First Lady, in order to stop more girls from ending up like you...

 
**Helena:**
...would you let me start over with your first wish?

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
...

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Helena. Magical Girl of Wisdom and Mystics.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
Yes. If that is your true wish, then... I will grant it!

 
**Helena:**
Thank you, First Lady. I'll do it right this time.

 
**Sapphire:**
The First Lady's magical energy is fading.
So is Mila's...

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Oh no... Mila's going to disappear.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Listen, First Lady.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
You were abandoned and forgotten by the world.
And you feel terribly betrayed.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Magical girls aren't witches.
And they aren't queens.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
They don't seek rewards for their miracles.
They don't use magic for themselves.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
They just put the feelings that well up in their hearts into spells, for people that they will never know.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Otherwise, their impossible wishes become curses.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
Their emotions get trapped in the gaps between worlds and turn into purgatory.

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
I still... And Mila, you...

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
No, First Lady.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
You've cast enough spells. You cast them until your throat went hoarse.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
You read the book of magic all the way to the last page.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
It's true that new dangers and new enemies will never stop threatening the people.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
But even so... That's why new magical girls, like Illya, are born.

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
They're still incomplete magical girls, and maybe you can't totally rely on them...

 
**A：Mila/Illya:**
But that's why, in their hands...

 
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**
...the future lies within them!

 
**Mash:**
A new jewel appeared in Helena's hand...

 
**Chloe:**
...

 
**Illya:**
...

 
**Ruby:**
Oh-ho? They're holding hands like lovers.

 
**Ruby:**
But now you're both back to normal.

 
**Illya:**
Y-Yeah. I'm fine. What about you, Chloe?

 
**Chloe:**
Ugh... where am I... who am I...?

 
**Chloe:**
I don't know... I can't remember any of the wicked things I've done... So you can't ask me to be responsible for them...

 
**Chloe:**
I think I forced Miyu to give me magical energy in a way that violated FCC standards, but it was consensual so that doesn't count.

 
**Chloe:**
And no one knows that I used the First Lady's power to make a world where I was the star...

 
**Chloe:**
...and lived a lovey-dovey life with my brother, but then I was accused by the ESRB army of justice, and I turned evil, and was defeated...

 
**Chloe:**
Anyway, a lot's happened, but well done, Illya!
That's my heroic magical girl! I believed in you!

 
**Illya:**
Whoa... I know it's not Chloe's fault, but I think she should be a little more repentant...

 
**Sapphire:**
In a sense, she has the same MG Power as Illya, that lets her never doubt herself. Her alignment's chaotic, though.

 
**Ruby:**
Chloe, that's why you can never be the main character.

 
**Chloe:**
Hey! This is where you're supposed to say, “It must've been so hard for you, but you're still lovely”!

 
**Chloe:**
I worked hard too!

 
**Chloe:**
Don't you understand that it was only my iron-clad self-control that kept the First Lady in check?

 
**Miyu:**
That's... true. Chloe and the First Lady had a very high compatibility.

 
**Miyu:**
It was only thanks to Chloe's strong mind that she was able to stop the First Lady from assimilating her completely.

 
**Chloe:**
Right? Right? My heart of justice isn't so bad, is it?♪

 
**Chloe:**
I like fun things, mischief, my brother, and also being mean to the weak.

 
**Chloe:**
But I hate sadness more than anything. That was the one thing the First Lady and I couldn't agree on.

 
**Miyu:**
(Yeah. I understand how the First Lady feels.
If she had possessed me...)

 
**Miyu:**
(I wouldn't have thought to hear someone out like that... She acts wicked, but Chloe had the same heart as Illya.)

 
**Miyu:**
(That's why it was Mila and Illya who saved her.
And also Chloe, who played with her...)

 
**Chloe:**
Am I imagining it, or is there a gentle look in Miyu's eyes? What? Do you see me in a new light or something?

 
**Miyu:**
Not at all. I'm going to be billing you for the psychological pain I suffered, Edelfelt-style.

 
**Chloe:**
That just means you want money!
You Edelfelts really are obsessed with money!

 
**Sapphire:**
That's only Luvia and Rin. Miyu has pure and proper ideas about finances.

 
**Helena:**
Done making up? Then let's finish this.

 
**Helena:**
I have the First Lady's jewel now.
If I use it for myself, nothing would change, but...

 
**Helena:**
If I make a world where wishes can circulate, instead of a closed world for just one person...

 
**Illya:**
I get it! So you just have to use the jewels for someone else's sake, huh?

 
**Helena:**
Yes, that's right. You pick this stuff up fast.

 
**Ruby:**
If you add in Nursery's and Medea's jewels, and the one from Mash, that's three of them!

 
**Ruby:**
The magical energy is flowing through them equally, and now we can go back to our old world!

 
**Chloe:**
Um... Does that mean we each take a jewel?

 
**Chloe:**
Illya uses one for Miyu, Miyu uses one for me, and I use one for Illya.

 
**Chloe:**
We all face the other person and wish that they'll be able to go home?

 
**Miyu:**
Is it that easy? That seems too easy...

 
**Illya:**
Don't think about it too hard!
Let's just focus on going home, Miyu!

 
**Miyu:**
Y-Yeah...
If you say so, Illya...

**Mash:**
You're going to take the First Lady's place, and serve as host to the magical girls who come here?

 
**Helena:**
Yes. I'll work to be the best I can.

 
**Helena:**
I'm sure I can find Medb and Nursery's Echoes as well.

 
**Helena:**
Also, Medea. If she'd stop being depressed and cheer up, she'd be good to have around.

 
**Mini Edison:**
Indeed. When you say you'll work at something, I know you're going to commit youself to it your whole life.

 
**Mini Edison:**
But this world is unstable.
It will probably fall apart eventually.

 
**Helena:**
Maybe. The end will come someday.

 
**Helena:**
And when it does, I'll go to some out-of-the-way world and live in a haunted house with the Echoes.

 
**Mash:**
That... Hehe. That sounds kind of fun.
Good luck.

 
**Helena:**
Of course, Mash Kyrielight.
Become a great magical girl, okay?

 
**Mash:**
I'm a Demi-Servant!

 
**Illya:**
Hahaha...

 
**Illya:**
Fujimaru, Mash.

 
**Illya:**
You are very nice people, so I was scared to bring it up, but...

 
**Illya:**
You've been fighting for your world for a long time now. And risking your life.

 
**Illya:**
I could tell from your conversation with Mr. Romani.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Illya:**
You have a far more important tasks than I do, but you saved me, Chloe, and Miyu anyway.

 
**Illya:**
That's not something you could do on a whim.
Look, Fujimaru is smiling like it's a joke again, though.

 
**Illya:**
You're suffering more than anyone, but you can still offer help to others. That's a miracle that no magic could create.

 
**Illya:**
Only someone like that can save the world.

 
**Illya:**
Come on, Chloe. You've got something to say too, right?

 
**Chloe:**
I'm sorry for causing you trouble,
Mash, Fujimaru.

 
**Chloe:**
You guys have it rough, but don't stress out too much.

 
**Illya:**
You could be more polite, Chloe!
Jeez...

 
**Miyu:**
Fujimaru. I'm really grateful.

 
**Miyu:**
I... I can't even imagine what kind of strong will you need to try and save the world.

 
**Miyu:**
But you did all this for us anyway.
I can really feel your warmth.

 
**Miyu:**
You can work so hard to fight for others...
I'm sure seeing you do that is what saves people.

 
**Miyu:**
I'm sure that that's what gave this world meaning. That's... what I think.

I'm useless without Sapphire.

I don't care if you're a child or a grown-up.

I thought to myself that your missions at Chaldea sounded kind of fun.

 
**Chloe:**
And when I heard that I'd lose the chance to peek at what was going on here, I didn't want to miss it.

 
**Chloe:**
This might be a little trick played by the First Lady. Maybe it's her way of paying me back for the use of my body? Something like that?

Wait a minute. Isn't this detour up to Fujimaru?

**Fake Astolfo:**
Whoa, you actually came!
You guys look like monsters!

 
**Fake Astolfo:**
You have to deal with me now!
Alright, I'll strum you a song on my horn!

 
**Illya:**
She popped in pleasantly, but...
Why did she say “strum” to play a horn...?

 
**Fake Astolfo:**
Oh, just watch how I play it! (Rustling)

 
**Mash:**
You don't have to show off your brand-new Noble Phantasm right here! Do you hear me, Fake-stolfo!?

 
**Fake Astolfo:**
Uh, yeah, I do have to!

 
**Fake Astolfo:**
Since I've been summoned into the “Magical Girl” class, promoting toys is my most important duty!

 
**Fake Astolfo:**
I am the very model of a magical girl, you know?

 
**Illya:**
Y-Yes...you definitely are!
Although it annoys me to admit it...

 
**Illya:**
And you even have that boyishness going for you...
Altogether it's a little over the top...

Oh, why are you looking at me like that?
Did I say something wrong?

 
**Ruby:**
Um, Illya?

If you dig too deep, you'll get yourself in an embarrassing situation. Boyish girls sometimes...

I completely agree. You're a perfect magical girl.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai. I think it's courageous of you to speak with such conviction, but please be prudent now.

 
**Mash:**
Illya's breathing became harsher. Any further and she'll descend into a place of madness!

 
**Illya:**
Boyish... Magical Girl...

 
**Illya:**
Th...th...those two concepts seem to be completely unrelated to each other, but I've come up with an idea!

 
**Illya:**
Speaking of a boyish girl, what do you think would happen if Gil transformed!?

 
**Illya:**
 
I might want to give it a try! Though it has really nothing to do with the situation right now... (heavy breathing)

 
**Mash:**
It's too late!

**Fake Astolfo:**
My name has an unnecessary “Fake” stuck to it, but I don't care!

 
**Mash:**
Um, anyway, can I ask one thing?
Especially of you, Ruby.

 
**Ruby:**
Sure sure, what is it?

 
**Ruby:**
Have you changed your mind about becoming the ultimate Captain Magical Girl with your charming shield moves?

 
**Mash:**
No. I couldn't leave Mr. Leonidas behind...
No, that's not what I wanted to ask.

 
**Mash:**
Does Fake-stolfo have any basis for calling himself a magical girl? Besides his usual “I just feel like it” thing.

 
**Mash:**
To be specific, it makes me wonder if my attacks will be effective in this Reality Marble!

 
**Ruby:**
Now that you mention it, I can feel strong MG Power from Fake-stolfo.

 
**Ruby:**
But I predict that you are strong enough to confront him in your current state, Mash!

 
**Mash:**
That statement slightly increases my complicated hopes and fears!

 
**Fake Astolfo:**
Hey, are you ready yet? Can I take a nap?
C'mon, let's do it... I'm tired of waiting... Zzz...

 
**Illya:**
Oh, I'm so sorry!
You already look so sleepy!

I apologize, let's leave it at that. As long as I can be useful in the battle, I'll give it my best!

Oh don't say that. Others have their rules, and I have my own.

She may be a fake, but she's still strong!

 
**Illya:**
Even before you mentioned it, her bloodlust was pretty obvious!

 
**Illya:**
And the smell of alcohol is starting to make me dizzy!

 
**Illya:**
I can't drink alcohol, so would you mind if I just fill your cup?

 
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**
Hehehe... Don't be so cold, have some fun with me...

We'll get drunk and call each other's names, and soon you'll find yourself in heaven... or in my little gourd?

Who is she!?

Hah! Now, listen carefully!

Born as an oni, so I meet my end;

The madden'd roses bloom beneath my feet,
And crimson blossoms cover Kyoto's streets!!

 
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**
Magical Douji! I☆BARA☆KI has arrived!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!

 
**Illya:**
I☆BARA☆KI...(gulp) What a powerful impact...
It's like graffiti drawn under a bridge.

I-I am not doing this because I want to...

And I have responded to the call.
Take a good look, world! I am the MIBU WOLF!

Which means I have awakened to the magical girl vibes, becoming First Unit Captain of the Magical Shinsengumi.

What? A Shinsengumi Magical Girl!?
That's so old, it's new!

From a Nobu Reversal to a Nobu Attack! And I shall finish you with my Nobu Buster by throwing you off the cliffs of Okehazama!

Um, doesn't appear there are any plans for a second Noble Phantasm like that.

It doesn't sound like the history I studied either.

The character portrait cuts off at the waist, but the muscled thighs peeking out of his miniskirt make quite the impact.

 
**E：???:**
And me! Look upon me, as well!

 
**Phantom:**
A ruffled petticoat! Clinging pure-white tights!
A perfectly coordinated outfit!

 
**Fou:**
Fo, fou...

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What are you two, with your, um... unusual outfits, doing here?

 
**Blackbeard:**
Bwahaha, well, you see... (Approaching)
You see...! (Thrust)

 
**Blackbeard:**
The pain!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I'm sorry! I couldn't help it!
Your beard and skirt left too much of an impact.

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, you're a bad influence on Chloe, so please move further away!

 
**Mash:**
Otherwise, my shield will slice you thin!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Gnnuughhh! Your shield!?
...Wait, how do shields work again!?

 
**Chloe:**
Mash, you look like Liz, but you're closer to Sella personality-wise.

 
**Chloe:**
I'm fine. You don't need to be so sensitive.

 
**Chloe:**
There are some school nurses who don't wear underwear because “it's fashion, so it's not embarrassing.”

 
**Chloe:**
And it's kind of fun to see loser adults up close. Hehehe.

 
**Blackbeard:**
Chloe's kindness and her devilish smile are to die for!

 
**Blackbeard:**
But are you telling me the principles expressed through our wardrobe are incomprehensible?

We love magical girls every day of our lives, and worship them with all our hearts and souls!

Movies, merchandise, maidens' lovely voices in CDs!
But that's not enough!

We want to live with them, and become one with them... That's right! Together! To get HER!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Yes! We want to be with them as much as we can!

You never did tell us your reasoning behind those outfits, but let's put that thought aside.

Master, Chloe, have you noticed?
This world is somehow...

Yeah. It's changed a lot since we left.

 
**Chloe:**
The spatial connections and the presences of enemies lurking around are all surprisingly different.

 
**Chloe:**
And I don't see Helena anywhere, even though she stayed behind.

 
**Chloe:**
If this is a different Reality Marble, then Reality Marbles have become pretty cruddy.

It stopped being a farce the moment you said that!

A singing magical girl... Sounds great.
 
**Phantom:**
Indeed. A whisper is a primitive spell. But the beautiful voice of a songbird, one that stirs the heart? Now that's something truly bewitching.

 
**Phantom:**
Songs are true magic. Songs are true magic. A beautiful singing voice raises a girl's magic to its highest potential.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Actually, Master...

 
**Mash:**
I'm starting to think we have no reason to stop Phantom.

**Chloe:**
Let me ask you a question. What would you do with a little bird that stopped singing?

 
**Phantom:**
Wait for it to sing, whisper to it to help it sing, then kill it.

 
**Mash:**
Kill... What if it were a hummingbird that always had an unpleasant voice?

 
**Phantom:**
It should cut out its own tongue, jump into a furnace, and turn itself into grilled chicken. Or perhaps explode.

She must stay with me...

 
**Phantom:**

**Phantom:**
Until the moment when she dies, and her love is filled with the flames of hatred and the desire to kill!

Nonsense. But entertaining nonetheless.

## Blackbeard Gentleman - The Treachery
 
**Blackbeard:**
Shiver me timbers, you seriously followed me all the way here? I'm impressed, Fujimaru.

 
**Blackbeard:**
Feel free to beat me and take my spot in the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen, if you want! Pew pew pew!

 
**Mash:**
Blackbeard, let us confirm one thing...

 
**Mash:**
You are one of the people behind this, are you not?

 
**Mash:**
We need to know the truth, so we can put an end to this.

 
**Mash:**
If you are plotting something that will make innocent girls cry, even I cannot defend you. Keep that in mind!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Oh, so nice. You're still trying to believe in me...

 
**Blackbeard:**
Mash is so wonderful... So radiant...
That stuff really turns me on...

**Chloe:**
Wait, Mash.

Maybe this is his serious mode.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Is it?
I-I'm sorry...

 
**Blackbeard:**
Ahah. You really are a goddess, Chloe.
And Mash is an angel.

 
**Blackbeard:**
But you're girls, too. It might be worth listening to what I have to say!

 
**Blackbeard:**
You see, once a man's got a treasure, he loses interest in it.

 
**Blackbeard:**
But you know, I hate to work hard!
I don't want a girl who's way out of my league!

I want somebody close yet just out of reach.

That's what makes for good entertainment, right!? Playing it safe is boring!

Fanboys have their own set of rules, but the pirate's way compels him to break the rules and take what he wants.

Magic isn't the only miracle. A girl who embodies the miracles of God is also in the category of magical girls.

A magical girl who took mere tricks and elevated them to the realm of real magic.

 
**Gilles:**
Is there a problem with such enchanting magical girls existing? No, they must exist!

Compared to the other old guys, his extreme seriousness worries me a little.

**Diarmuid:**
Mash and that tanned maiden I haven't seen before...

 
**Diarmuid:**
I'm telling you this for your own good: never become an adult woman.

 
**Chloe:**
Wh-Whaaat? What kind of advice is that!?

 
**Mash:**
Not to mimic a certain iron nurse, but I also sense the necessity of medical treatment through heavy firepower!

**Diarmuid:**
There is no other path. I must humbly enter battle!


## Testament Prologue
 
**Chloe:**
Well, now we've defeated the self-proclaimed Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen! They certainly gave us enough trouble.

 
**Chloe:**
We still don't know what they were after...

 
**Chloe:**
But at least now this entire twisted world is finished, right!?

 
**Chloe:**
Let's go back...to Chaldea?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...?

 
**Mash:**
Something strange is happening! Again!

**Chloe:**
How nice of them to make it so clear for us.
Trap, right?

 
## Witness the Transformation
 
**Chloe:**
I need to ask...

 
**Chloe:**
Is there another perverted magical girl fanboy waiting for us? Like the leader of the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen?

 
**Mash:**
You mean the one that Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen have referred to?

 
**Mash:**
What's that...?

**D：???:**
That's right, it's me. Do you demons dare stand in the way of magical girls?

 
**Chloe:**
D-Demons!? Us?

 
**Fou:**
Fouuu!?

 
**Testament:**
My name is Testament, like the sign of my holy covenant with those gentlemen!

It's like how the First Lady took over Chloe...no, you look like Illya!

So Illya was the ideal magical girl?
 
**Testament:**
If that's what you think, then my form reflects it so.

 
**Chloe:**
I'm stunned. Instead of using my body this time, a form was created directly out of magical energy?

Don't call me a knockoff! You don't have any issues with my Cosmos design, right?

 
**Chloe:**
Though I admit this is getting confusing.

 


---
 
**Chloe:**
But, well, I am a bit relieved.

 
**Chloe:**
I was afraid Mama was going to appear. “Prisma☆Iri has descended in all of her splendor!” she'd say.

 
**Chloe:**
Turns out I was worried for nothing.

 
**Mash:**
I imagine that would have been quite the psychological blow...

What's the purpose of the Four Gentlemen?


---
 
**Testament:**
Phantom, Gilles de Rais, Diarmuid, and Blackbeard.

 
**Testament:**
Through their mighty wishes and noble sacrifices, I was able to form into a genuine existence. Heehee.

 
**Chloe:**
You can't just say “a genuine existence” and laugh like that so casually!

 
**Testament:**
It's true. I am the crystallization of their thoughts.
An idol created by sad gentlemen.

 
**Testament:**
Just as a girl's feelings become a magical girl's driving force, the wishes of those gentlemen gave me life and let me soar.

 
**Mash:**
You're the crystallization of their thoughts? No, I don't think so. And it wasn't so much their wishes as it was their obsession.

 
**Chloe:**
True. And instead of noble, let's go with pathetic.

 
**Chloe:**
I know I'm one to talk, considering I was involved heavily in the first half of the event, but you're really warped.

 
**Chloe:**
How many times do I have to say that it's meaningless to change the world with magic based on sacrifices?

 
**Chloe:**
More than anything, it's annoying to hear those words come out of someone who looks like Illya. So knock it off.

 
**Testament:**
Heehee, you have a problem with sacrifices?
They were happy to offer themselves to me.

 
**Testament:**
I will give them everything.
But I am not going to repay them.

 
**Testament:**
If that's what they wanted, there are plenty of women in the real world.

 
**Testament:**
All they need is to be captivated by my dancing during the ending credits.

 
**Testament:**
Just loop a recycled transformation sequence until it's burned into their retinas.

 
**Testament:**
The more the wishes of men are full of gloom and a hopeless sense of inferiority, the more brilliantly my dream shines!

 
**Chloe:**
What!? You got nasty all of a sudden!

I won't allow you to belittle magical girl fans!
 
**Testament:**
Identifying yourself as a “fan” out of some silly pride is just embarrassing.

 


---
 
**Testament:**
You know what it is?

 
**Testament:**
In the world of magical girls, filthy men are worse than demons. They're worthless scum.

 
**Testament:**
And you know what else?

 
**Testament:**
Magical girls should only fall in love with each other♡

Fou, fo, fouuuu. Fou, fou.

It seems Fou strongly objects to that remark.

 


---
 
**Testament:**
Heehee, but this is perfect.

 
**Testament:**
My tale has only just begun, so I'll leave you with a parting gift, demons!

 
**Testament:**
While gathering the wishes of men and turning them into despair, I'll leave them with minimum HP and inspire in them vain hope.

 
**Testament:**
So don't interfere with my journey of endlessly granting bittersweet heaven and hell!

Kyuu.

 


---
 
**Testament:**
Okay. That aside, it's hard to fight in this dress, so I'd better transform!

 
**Chloe:**
What!? I have a bad feeling about this!
Does she intend to use my body, too!?

 
**Testament:**
Heehee, that isn't necessary.

 
**Testament:**
I'll show you with this body what color suits a true magical girl!

Master, please calm down! Isn't that the kind of bold, brazen wish that spawned her in the first place?

That's right! Although...

I'm not against that kind of thing myself, but there's a time and place for everything!

## World End Match: Testament
 
**Testament:**
Ooohhh... Unghh...

 
**Chloe:**
Wh-What's wrong?
Did it really hurt that much?

 
**Testament:**
In the end...

 
**Testament:**
Of course no one could be the ideal and almighty magical girl for everybody!

 
**Testament:**
The very idea is ridiculous!

 
**Testament:**
A character that fulfills the requests of all gentlemen?
I'd be so bland I'd fade away into nothingness!

 
**Chloe:**
Now she's being brutally honest!

 
**Mash:**
Th-Then what about what we did?
Aren't you a victim now?

 
**Testament:**
No. This too is a result influenced by the wishes of those gentlemen... (Glance)

 
**Testament:**
Hiding one's goodness deep inside while being forced to do evil deeds is hot, right? It's kind of a staple, isn't it? (Glance)

 
**Chloe:**
Yeesh. This girl is beyond redemption.

 
**Testament:**
The power of the feelings from Blackbeard and the others is gone. It supported me well up to now. I must be grateful for that...

**Testament:**
You are guests.

 
**Testament:**
You were summoned to this world both as spectators to a magical girl's exploits and as demons.

 
**Testament:**
When my influence disappears, the alterations to this Reality Marble will also be undone.

 
**Testament:**
This world will return to the peaceful resting place of magical girls, managed by Helena.

 
**Testament:**
When that happens, you will be shot out.

 
**Testament:**
But you'll be able to return safely to Chaldea.
So rest assured.

 
**Mash:**
Testament...

 
**Testament:**
...

 
**Testament:**
If there is a magical girl who has reached perfection, like one that they were seeking, I wonder who will understand her misery...

 
**Testament:**
Who will save that girl?

 
**Testament:**
Who will show magic to a magical girl...?

 
**Chloe:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
She was self-centered, but also a sad person.

 
**Chloe:**
You think so? I'm sure that was all calculated, too.

 
**Chloe:**
Although maybe that was better than leaving us with a parting shot like, “There will be a second and third magical girl waiting for you!”

Be it magic or miracles, there's always equivalent exchange.
 
**Chloe:**
That... may be right.

 
**Chloe:**
But hardship and effort with no reward is also the way of the world.

 
**Chloe:**
So no matter who becomes happy, I can't find it in myself to blame them.

I can't tell if Chloe is pessimistic or optimistic.

Yes, don't take any weird lessons from this.
