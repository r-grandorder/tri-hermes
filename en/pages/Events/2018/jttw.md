# Sanzang Coming to the West

## Prologue: "Five Elements Mountain: The Buddha's Apprentice"
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, what is that?
...A roll of paper?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. It's an ancient manuscript, like an old book.
We call it a scroll.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, how I love the smell of old books.
They really have luster. (Sniff Sniff)

 
**Mash:**
Ah... So that's your fetish, is it...

 
**Mash:**
Excuse me. My questions were an invasion of privacy. From now on, I promise to ignore what I see.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I'm not some kind of bibliomaniac, okay!?
I was asked to bring it from the warehouse, so I did.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This was an item brought into Chaldea and kept there because it was thought to be a precious artifact affiliated with a certain person.

 
**Mash:**
That means it is a catalyst for summoning. You said you were asked. So, was it for some kind of experiment?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, this was an unreasonable favor from a certain painter at the workshop&mdash; Oh hi, Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai.
...You're dressed a bit flashy, aren't you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
The party is here, right?
 
**Mash:**
Party? ...Here?
I don't think any have been planned...

 
**Mash:**
You were probably given the wrong information.
...Let's interrogate Caesar later.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
In that case, what kind of smell do you like, Mash?
 
**Mash:**
Which part of the conversation did you hear!?

 
**Mash:**
Let me see... Although I am still young and inexperienced, there are still smells I love, or I want to fall in love with.

 
**Mash:**
The smell of soil, the smell of green pastures, the smell of fresh-baked bread. Fou, you smell a little like sunshine.

 
**Mash:**
And, well, when I'm in your room, Senpai...sometimes...
I feel dizzy...

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm? I'm sorry for interrupting your conversation, but something is off. Somehow the system started by itself...

 
**Mash:**
...? I assumed that you were making preparations for a summoning. But you're right, something is strange&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This setup is completely backwards&mdash; Leonardo! What kind of joke are you trying to pull off!? Stop the experiment now!

 
**Announcement:**
Unsummon Program, start. Due to an exception in processing, Coffin support is refused.

 
**Announcement:**
Spiritron Conversion, start. Rayshift starts in 6, 5, 4...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Get away from there, Mash!
You too, Fujimaru!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please come over here! It's dangerous!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's weird, Mash! For some reason, I can't move!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You really should have a good talk with Da Vinci sometime.
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
...
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Where am I?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm stuck...between these rocks... I can't move!
 

 
**A：???:**
Looks like you've regained consciousness.
Are you okay?

 
**A：???:**
Where is this, you ask? This place is north of Loulan, west of Hami. It lies at the border between the Great Tang Empire's realm and Gaochang.

 
**A：???:**
We are at the foot of the Five Elements Mountain, where the peaks seem to be able to reach heaven. And you are under some heavy-looking rocks.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Huh? Under the rocks!? Help me!
 
**A：???:**
Of course, I'll help you right away! ...But you seem surprisingly okay? Oops, spoke too soon... Why is your face turning pale?

 
**A：???:**
Oh. Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to tease you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Is this some sort of kinky play?
 
**A：???:**
Huh? ...Well, with composure like that, you're obviously no ordinary person. Still, you don't look like a demon to me either.

 
**A：???:**
...Yes! I need to make up my mind!

 

 
**A：???:**
I'm certain that you must be the one that I've been looking for. The Buddha must have brought us together!

 
**Sanzang:**
My name is Xuanzang Sanzang.
&mdash;What about you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm a Master from Chaldea Security Organization.
 
**Sanzang:**
Chaldea? Master? Hmmm...
And you say your name is Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Yo, I'm !
 
**Sanzang:**
I love energetic disciples!
...Oops, you're not my disciple yet.

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Okay, Fujimaru. First, let me get you out of there. Behold the blessing of the Buddha!

 
**Sanzang:**
aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...

 
**Sanzang:**
...Are you okay? Did you get hurt?
Do you want me to get you some bandages?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm perfectly fine.
 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;I see. I'm so glad! So?
I bet you see me in a different light now, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Everything is a bit foggy right now...
 
**Sanzang:**
That's concerning.
Okay, let's take a little break!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm sure you'll feel better while we talk.
Speaking of which, it's time for my preaching!

 

 
**Sanzang:**
All right! Now, let's start over.

 
**Sanzang:**
Let me introduce myself. I'm Xuanzang Sanzang. Despite how I look, I'm a monk. A proper monk that follows the teachings of the Buddha.

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm currently in the middle of a journey to the far western land, Tianzhu, under the decree of the emperor of the Tang Dynasty. As for my mission... Ummm...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
To get the precious scriptures?
 
**Sanzang:**
What, how do you know? Oh no, I guess I was showing too much of my virtuousness...

 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;That's right, just like you've said!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
To collect...seven...dragon orbs?
 
**Sanzang:**
You mean to materialize the wish granter that could fulfill any wish by offering the blood of those seeking it?

 
**Sanzang:**
Too bad, I won't be swayed by such an easy temptation. But, you're on the right track&mdash; Yes, I am collecting something.

 
**Sanzang:**
As for what I'm collecting...

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Scriptures! I have a duty to collect scriptures! Scriptures that can be found on the way to Tianzhu! But...

 
**Sanzang:**
The demon I've subdued to guide me ran... I mean got separated from me. And my horse got eaten... I mean I gave it a break.

 
**Sanzang:**
I've been lost... I mean fighting by myself for days and then... I ran into you! I was so scared...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I see. Very virtuous.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Maybe it was too soon for you to travel?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
What? You got a problem with a virtuous monk like me!?

 
**Sanzang:**
By. The. Way. Isn't it about time you tell me about yourself?

 
**Sanzang:**
...I see... Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Incinerated Earth... Singularities with Holy Grails... Guardians of Humanity...

 
**Sanzang:**
It's all rather grandiose and hard to believe, but... you're Fujimaru of Chaldea, which is from the future...

 
**Sanzang:**
I believe your story. This must be part of the Buddha's guidance... I'm sure.

 
**Sanzang:**
The Buddha exists beyond space and time. He could send a messenger from the future to the past.

 
**Sanzang:**
So, how do you go back to Chaldea?
Don't you have any tools to send an emergency signal?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Actually, no.
 
**Sanzang:**
You're lost! Oh my, so you're lost too!
Good, good, we're rather alike, you and I!

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ahem. I mean, uh, now I know the reason behind our encounter, Fujimaru.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm still not sure that I traveled to the past
 
**Sanzang:**
Then again, you can't pinpoint your exact coordinates right now. In that case, we're just wasting time sitting here arguing.

 

 
**Sanzang:**
When I become great, I will say this: Do good deeds, punish bad deeds, and listen to Sanzang.

 
**Sanzang:**
So, Fujimaru?
Become my disciple!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Why?
 
**Sanzang:**
Uh... I mean... I'm...still in the middle of the journey...
And I've got a long way to go...

 
**Sanzang:**
I've got no food... My tummy is beyond empty... But all worldly things are transitory... Anyway, I need a disciple!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
If you will make me your number one disciple.
 
**Sanzang:**
Of course! Easy peasy!
You are my number one disciple! Yay!

 

 
**Sanzang:**
...To tell the truth, I remember a little bit. I think I've experienced this journey to Tianzhu once before.

 
**Sanzang:**
But I can't remember the specifics.
Just like you don't know left from right here.

 
**Sanzang:**
It's very strange, but this must be some kind of meaningful fate for the both of us.

 
**Sanzang:**
This journey to the west is a trial from the Buddha.
So he won't give you an answer. He won't do anything.

 
**Sanzang:**
Most likely there's a reason for this.
To send you back to Chaldea&mdash;

 
**Sanzang:**
That's the challenge I was given.
For you, it's a gift from on high.

 
**Sanzang:**
So... From now on, you can call me “Master”!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
“Master” is taken, so... Mentor!
 
**Sanzang:**
Ugh, I feel like I've been called that before...
No, you must properly address me as Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Don't overdo it, Sanzang-chan.
 
**Sanzang:**
Ugh, just so you know, I won't take a rebellious pupil like you to nirvana!

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Anyway, scriptures won't just fall into our hands.
Come, let's head to the land in the far west, Tianzhu!
GO WEST! GO!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, Fujimaru! Are you here?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Master! Please answer me!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is not good. [♂ He /♀ She] must have moved.
It will be hard to figure out the exact coordinates again...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Can you at least send me to the coordinates where Senpai is!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm trying to figure out why [♂ he /♀ she] got transported right now. It would be so much easier if we knew.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll do my best, of course.
But I'm sorry, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...

 
## Volume 1: "Kingdom of Tartars: Along on the Journey"
 
**Sanzang:**
It's coming back to me now!
I had three disciples!

 
**Sanzang:**
Say, disciple! Do you happen to know about my past disciples?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Are they a monkey, a pig...and a kappa?
 
**Sanzang:**
A kappa? What's a kappa?
No idea what that is... Kapa, kapapa...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
A black panther, a puppy, and glasses.
 
**Sanzang:**
You mean, a dog, a monkey and a pheasant, right? Huh? Why do I know that...

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Anyway, speaking of monkeys... Sun... Sun Wukong!
My reliable number one disciple!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So you had pupils before?
 
**Sanzang:**
Oh... I'm sorry. I did say I was gonna make you my number one disciple, huh? My bad.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear anything.
 
**Sanzang:**
...Thank you for your thoughtfulness.
You're so kind, Fujimaru.

 
**Sanzang:**
But there's no need to worry! I'm sure I'll remember why I lost my disciples during our journey.

 

 
**Sanzang:**
But this is a problem. A huge problem, perhaps.

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm on a journey to Tianzhu, but I wonder why Sun Wukong isn't here.

 
**Sanzang:**
Not just Wukong... But the other two pupils too... That's right, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing are not here either...

 
**Sanzang:**
This must be a message from the Buddha, too.
I mean, journeys are always so mysterious!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
The new number one disciple will take care of it.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You have me now, right?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
...W-Wait a minute, what am I getting so flustered for!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm impressed that a new disciple like yourself can think like that! But that's prohibited here.

 
**Sanzang:**
As a disciple, you must follow the Buddha's teachings and worship him. Be careful not to brag too much.

 
**Sanzang:**
The law of the jungle applies to the journey to Tianzhu. If you are not careful, you will be eaten by demons.

 
**Sanzang:**
But... well... considering the hardships we're going to face, having another disciple or two would be reassuring...

 
**Sanzang:**
For example... Zhu Bajie...

 
**B：???:**
Oink, oink.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Oink?
 

 
**B：???:**
Oink, oink. Oink!

 
**Sanzang:**
...What is this!? I'm hearing the squeal of a poor piggy...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Could it be Zhu Bajie!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
It came from the other side of the rocks...
 

 
**B：???:**
I'm oink. Very oink!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Oh, David, it's YOU!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Yeah, he's a pig. Definitely.
 

 
**Sanzang:**
His name is... David? Just like Fujimaru, he was underneath a rock!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
No, no. I'm the cool Zhu Bajie. ...Well, here, at least. That's how things seem to have turned out.

 
**Sanzang:**
Fujimaru's friend?
Then he's a member of Chaldea, too?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
A pig? But you're a shepherd...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Just ignore him...
 

 
**Sanzang:**
No more indecisive attitude!
Anyway, I'll rescue you from there right now!

 
**Sanzang:**
aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I'm saved... Thank you! I couldn't do anything by myself. I thought I was going to become a monster's dinner.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Right, but the situation was about to get much worse.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I was starting to feel good about being squished.
Whew, that was a close one, oink.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Ah... You saved him...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
This guy can have fun anywhere, huh?
 

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
It was truly painful! I want to emphasize that part!
I mean, I can sue for damages later!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
No, let's refrain from talking about that now.
So you are Xuanzang Sanzang... As beautiful as rumored.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
That dress is so beautiful and perfect for a wedding. Were you expecting this chance meeting?

 
**Sanzang:**
Huh? This is an important kasaya given to me by the Buddha.

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ummm, don't confuse it with a wedding dress, okay?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Are you going to ignore the fact she's basically a nun?
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Why? There's no problem, right?
Anyway&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Too bad, but she's ordained. She's not Abishag.
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Not Abishag? NO?!
Such a waste! Well, anyway&mdash;

 

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
It's true her beauty makes me want to eat her up!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Hi, my name is Zhu Bajie David. Oh beautiful lady with long black hair, I will gladly become your disciple.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Actually, there's another one stuck under the rock who's fit to be your disciple. He got involved in the same fashion as me.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I guess calling out for help is just too much for his pride.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Jeez. Pride won't earn you a penny, oink.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You should have a little bit more pride...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Do you know the word “shameless”?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
We'll talk later! Show me where he is!
We don't want the rock to crush him!

 
**C：???:**
You have my gratitude for releasing me from this prison. My name is Li Shuwen, an assassin not worth mentioning.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
It seems here I will be known as the third disciple, Sha Wujing... You may refer to me as so from now on.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Master Li, are you sure?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Becoming a disciple that easily?
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Well, what's the difference between Servants and Chinese opera actors? It matters not.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
How am I supposed to refuse the wish of a highly respectable monk? That aside&mdash;

 
**Sha Wujing:**
It's such an honor to meet the Xuanzang Sanzang whom I grew so fond of from the fairy tales I read when I was young.

 
**Sanzang:**
You don't need to praise me like that... I'm the one who should thank you. I hear you are a renowned master of the spear. How reassuring!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Of course. I will behead as many enemies as you'd like and offer you their heads just to serve you well.

 
**Sanzang:**
...B-Behead!? Heads? No, no, no! That's so unsettling! Don't kill for no reason! It's prohibited!

 
**Sanzang:**
Oh no... We're surrounded!?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
It looks like the monsters we got rid of earlier have returned, oink. They brought their buddies to share their food they found in the wasteland.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
It's just been one thing after another.
But we can't let them eat us without a fight.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Is it all right, my master?
This is self-defense, not some unnecessary killing.

 
**Sanzang:**
Th-That's fine, go ahead, Sha Wujing!
But try to disperse them first...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Understood. And how interesting. You're more virtuous than the Xuanzang I've read about!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Sha Wujing:**
Now then. We can't let Master walk on this long, difficult journey. We disciples are one thing, but she's another.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Do you want to ride on my shoulders?
I don't have a ponytail, unfortunately, but... Oink.

 
**Sanzang:**
Uh, I wholeheartedly refuse. However, I do wish we had someone to carry our luggage... Hmm?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
There is something running wildly over there...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
That big red body... Is it a horse?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Red? Can it be...

 
**Sanzang:**
The Tartars of this land are known for breeding great horses! Can we bring one over here?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
If that's your wish!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanzang:**
...Let's go home.
There's nothing here. NO WEST.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
That's Lu Bu. Yup, Lu Bu.
So the fourth companion is that fierce warrior.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
I see, instead of the famed Red Hare, we get its rider instead. Well, it should not pose a problem for us. My master, please take a ride.

 
**Sanzang:**
No! I can't, I can't!
This horse is scary&mdash;!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Whoa there! Whoa!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
What's in his hand? A scroll...?
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...Hmm?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Despite your appearance, it seems you're quite meticulous. You're carefully guarding that, huh?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
[♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru?
Why don't you show that to the master?

 
**Sanzang:**
...Th-This is... the lost scripture!
You were protecting it by yourself in this wasteland?

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm so sorry that I screamed.
You are an amazing attendant, and an amazing horse!

 
**Sanzang:**
It's scary, but it's part of my training!
Oh magnificent red horse, lend me your shoulders!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
On his shoulders!?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Wait! There was an option to ride on my shoulders too, oink!

 
**Sanzang:**
Hey, actually, this is nice.
Are you used to letting people ride on your shoulders?

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I'm used to it, too!

 
**Sanzang:**
What? The monsters had this scripture?
And there must be more?

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]

 
**Sanzang:**
...Strange, very strange indeed.
Also, Zhu Bajie, you need to shut up.

 
**Sanzang:**
...My mind is clearing as I read this scripture...
Was that how they work? Oh well...

 
**Sanzang:**
Sun Wukong! Sha Wujing! Bad Bajie!
This is my commemorable first order!

 
**Sanzang:**
We, the Sanzang crew, will collect the scriptures on our way to Tianzhu!

 
**Sanzang:**
If you have any objections, I won't get mad, so come forward!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'll put this golden headband around your head and start preaching! I'll make you change your mind! No one shall go against me!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I guess refusal is not an option...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Is Sanzang possibly... a demon herself?
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Kaka! That's the great Sanzang I know!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
She defeats every evildoer that stands in her way... even those who have reformed! A flawless beauty that troubled even the heinous three!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Fujimaru, let it go. This is the real Sanzang.
You can't escape this fate.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
We have no choice but to accompany her on this journey. Well well, this is getting interesting!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So that's the kind of person she is!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Must collect... scriptures!
 

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I don't think this is interesting, oink!

 
## Volume 2: "Flat Peak Mountain: The Attractive Demon Sisters of the Lotus Cave"
 
**Golden Horn:**
Silver Horn, it seems like this fearless, pitiful Tang monk has stepped into our territory: the Lotus Cave.

 
**Silver Horn:**
Golden Horn, it seems like this cute and delicious-looking Tang monk was lured in by the aroma from the Flat Peak Mountain.

 
**Golden Horn:**
If it's a man, let's melt him all the way to the bone. Taunt him, torture him, and then swallow him. Isn't that right, Silver Horn?

 
**Silver Horn:**
Yes, Golden Horn. However, if it's a woman, let's welcome her warm-heartedly, play with her, befriend her, and then slowly drink her dry... Hehehe.

 
**Both:**
Ah, I'm aching with excitement...
I can hardly wait any longer.

 
**Both:**
...That aside, we sure are perfect for these roles, aren't we...

 
**Sanzang:**
Wasteland as far as the eye can see... I thought we would run into some kind of oasis if we followed caravan routes...

 
**Sanzang:**
Am I hallucinating!? But my throat is dry and my belly is empty... Oh, dear Buddha! Are you out shopping?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Are we in the past?
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Are you asking if we Rayshifted to the era when Sanzang was alive?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Well, I don't think that's the case,
[♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
We've spent many days here already, yet you didn't see that ring of light in the sky, right?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
However, a constant supply of magical energy is needed for us Servants to exist. That supply is coming from somewhere right now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Are we in the world of “Journey to the West”?
 
**Sha Wujing:**
Now, if you say you are being forced to play in the drama “Journey to the West,” then there is no place for us to be here.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
There should be the real Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing right next to our master. What's the point of recreating the play with her alone?

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ugh.

 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
My master. Do you have any ideas?
Didn't you feel something by getting the scripture?

 
**Sanzang:**
Yes... I remembered one thing.

 
**Sanzang:**
I don't know why, but... I dismissed my disciples,
Sun Wukong and the others.

 
**Sanzang:**
All three have left my side.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...I see.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Did you lay them all off when they fulfilled their terms? Restructuring, eh? How cold and unsentimental.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
But I won't denounce my master.
Because you can't be a manager unless you are realistic.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Well, I wouldn't let them leave if it were up to me!
They always say, “Make a pig fat, then eat it,” right!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That's true, oink.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
When are you getting fat then, oink?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Hmmm... You may be right...
That's why they're not with me right now...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Don't get so depressed.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm sure they'll be back again sometime.
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Do you really think so...

 
**Sanzang:**
...That aside, I'm not feeling good right now...
It feels like someone punched me in the stomach...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
No doubt because you haven't eaten anything. I guess we have no choice but to feed you a monster's flesh and blood.

 
**Sanzang:**
Not that... Please don't...

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
He's saying there is a cave up ahead!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Maybe there's water.
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Hey...Fujimaru, ...just one thing...

 
**Sanzang:**
Who is... Mash? You were calling that name when you were under the rock.

 
**Sanzang:**
Fujimaru, is she important to you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...A junior that's very important to me.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I feel like we are together even when we are apart.
 

 
**Sanzang:**
...I see...

 
**???:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
Something smells sweet... The smell of fruits...
This place, it must be a food storage!

 
**Sanzang:**
That's my number one disciple! You have a great nose,
I mean, intuition! Let's eat!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanzang:**
Uh, what? A trap?
That peach is rotten?

 
**Golden Horn:**
Oh. I thought you'd be the one to eat it first and turn into a carrot. I guess it won't be that easy.

 
**Golden Horn:**
Hehe, welcome to the Lotus Cave, Tang monk and her apprentices.

 
**Silver Horn:**
I am so tired of waiting. But that monkey there looks ready to eat, all dehydrated like that.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
The evil-looking Gorgon Sisters!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Wait a minute, they don't recognize us!?
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
The Lotus Cave, you said. That means they are the Golden Horned King and the Silver Horned King&mdash;

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
...They're so similar it's sad to even look.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
That's not good. It's not just they're way too into their roles, they're even turning back to being the goddesses that bring destruction upon humans.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
I see... It seems you are aware of the enemy's True Name&mdash;

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Fujimaru. I don't think I need to explain, but Golden Horn and Silver Horn will come with THOSE.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
If you answer to your name, that gourd will suck you in and melt you alive.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
The Purple Gold Red Gourd and the Suet Jade Flask.
I cannot see them.

 
**Silver Horn:**
There's no need for us to use Noble Phantasms. Once you're under our poison, you will call out our names and beg us.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I see. So this cave is like a gourd's reservoir, and we are flies that fell on the surface of the water.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Trying to fight the enemies in your own safe zone...
How unscrupulous! Shame on you, you wicked women!

 
**Golden Horn:**
It's not unscrupulous, it's negligent. But then, I can sense the same smell from you too, though.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Humph, I don't think so, lady.
Did you think I would get mad being provoked?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
If I'm in danger just by being here, then I will leave the fighting to the experts. I'm stepping back, oink.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Come on, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru!
Please take care of them!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Of course. The main feature of “Journey to the West” is the tales of demon huntings!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Looks like neither Golden Horn nor Silver Horn are trained. Lord Red Horse and myself will suffice&mdash;!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Golden Horn:**
Idiot. Sweet ladies like us wouldn't want to get blood blisters from spears or get the rusted metal smell of swords on us, would we?

 
**Silver Horn:**
There is a lot of food and water here.
And the scriptures you are seeking, too.

 
**Golden Horn:**
But we will consume everything.

 
**Both:**
Come! Melt them, unthaw them, dissolve them and drink them all up...

 
**Both:**
&mdash;Bronze Horn!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Bronze Horn&mdash;!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
That's the first I've heard of it!?
 

 
**Bronze Horn:**
Ummm... Right... I'm Bronze Horn...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Great! Bronze Horn is outside of my strike zone!
Don't hold back and defeat her!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...No. I am a warrior, not a demon. This bond between these sisters is too tragic, I cannot bear to witness it any longer...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Honestly, I have lost my will to fight.
My master, shouldn't we save Bronze Horn over there?

 
**Sanzang:**
No, we can't. I can tell this is just another one of their tricks.

 
**Sanzang:**
It's a conventional method to make us lower our guard. We can't buy into it.

 
**Sanzang:**
Besides, my stomach is at its limit!
We'll talk after we have taken their food!

 
**Sanzang:**
GO, Fujimaru!
Begin with that big girl first!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's to save my mentor, I have no choice!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Girl...?
 

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Sanzang:**
Well, I'm stuffed!

 
**Sanzang:**
Golden Horn and Silver Horn escaped, but they didn't really do anything bad, so let's turn a blind eye for now!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Wise decision. The spoils of war are more important right now. Oh, leave the management of the treasure to me. I'll make sure it's done right.

 
**Bronze Horn:**
...Victory is yours. Go ahead and do whatever you want with me. I don't care.

 
**Sanzang:**
How admirable. You're willing to give up your old ways even though you're a demon! ...But then again, you haven't done anything wrong, have you?

 
**Sanzang:**
Let's see, which should I have you do... 10,000 Hindu squats or copying the Heart Sutra 10,000 times...

 
**Sanzang:**
You look fit already, so maybe copying the Heart Sutra will be a good punishment.

 
**Bronze Horn:**
Well then, I will copy the sutra.
Yes, copying sounds good. I'm not good at that.

 
**Sanzang:**
Okay! Then I'll write you a recommendation letter to the librarian at Daci'en Temple! Study hard!

 
**Bronze Horn:**
Thank you so much.
Personally this is the best thing ever!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Bronze Horn... No, I shouldn't say anything now. It's better than being turned into some kind of demon king.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
My mentor. Here is the scripture.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Sanzang. The scripture.
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Um... Yes. I see, so you've done your job.

 
**Sanzang:**
I was a little worried, but it seems this time around my disciples are hard workers!

 
**Sanzang:**
Wukong, Wujing, Bajie! Thank you guys!
Now, let's continue with our journey to Tianzhu!

 
## Volume 3: "Fire Cloud Cave: Sage King, Red Boy"
 
**Sanzang:**
Wow, the wind feels so good! We are finally done with the desert area... Now it should be peaceful for a while!

 
**Sanzang:**
This whole area looks familiar, too... Now I remember.

 
**Sanzang:**
Right. And I was thinking...
We just need to avoid every enemy base from now on!

 
**Sanzang:**
I pretty much already know the locations!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
That's an excellent plan, my master.
It's good to be able to relax, oink.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
By its very nature, I do not think a journey of hardship given by the Buddha would be done in by such pretentiousness...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
&mdash;Hmm!?

 
**E：???:**
Wait, wait, wait a minute!

 
**E：???:**
You must be Sanzang and her followers! Right!?
I'm not gonna let you go any further! (HAH)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We've got a sloppy one here.
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Now, now. Let's follow the protocol and ask for her identity.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Let me ask you just in case, who are you?
 

 
**E：???:**
How dare you ask me that!

 
**Red Boy:**
I am the protector of the Fire Cloud Cave in Withered Pine Valley: Red Boy, the Boy Sage King!

 
**Red Boy:**
Oh, damn, I said my name first! But it's no problem! (HAH)

 
**Sanzang:**
Red Boy... You have reformed and surrendered yourself to the Bodhisattva... Why do you stand in our way?

 
**Red Boy:**
Because my father will praise me!
...If I return home with your heads, that is!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Your father must be the Ox-Demon King.
According to the story of Journey to the West, that is.

 
**Red Boy:**
Hey, call him by his proper name! He's the Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, the King of Great Strength, the Nine-Headed Ox-Demon King!

 
**Red Boy:**
Oh, damn, I said it again! But that's fine!
My father is cool, anyway!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I feel for your father...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
That whole family is messed up...
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Red Boy is supposed to kidnap Sanzang through disguises and other tricks. Are you okay with all this?

 
**Red Boy:**
Humph. The story is meant to be changed.
I'm not willing to lose from the beginning!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
I see. Short-tempered, but quite eloquent.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Hmm, Saber of Red's father...
In other words, you're part of the Altriaverse.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
If that's the case, I don't know if it'll be blue or white, but I think I have an idea who this “father” is.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I don't think so. Not at all.
 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Red Horse agrees, too. There are just too many.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
And who do you think it'll be?
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
If it's the Ox-Demon King...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
“Only the ones who ate roast beef with tears in their eyes know the true taste of beef! Cow Saber!”

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
&mdash;and such? Oh, I'm so sorry. Please continue?

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Hmm, I can die in peace!
I've never seen such an inspirational attitude!

 
**Sanzang:**
What a graceful opponent she is...
I think I can get along with her pretty well!

 
**Sanzang:**
But it's too bad. Even if you were a friend, I'll crush you if you get in my way. That's my attitude!

 
**Sanzang:**
Get ready! I will go dhūtatatatata on you and eliminate you!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'll give you a chance to reform yourself afterwards!
I mean, we're already halfway friends!

 
**Red Boy:**
Are you serious, really!?
You're really good at making friends, huh!?

 
**Red Boy:**
But, sorry, I won't go easy on you even if we were friends. Because I'm Red Boy, the beloved son of the Ox-Demon King!

 
**Red Boy:**
Sanzang! I'm going to take you as an offering to my father!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanzang:**
Whoa, you scared me. I'm still not used to it...
&mdash;Are you ready, Fujimaru!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Of course!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Sure! I don't think she'll hand it over without a fight!
 

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Red Boy:**
Dammit, fine! You won! Here's the scripture!
Take it and get out of here!

 
**Sanzang:**
Wait a second, Red Boy.
No, Mo Boy!

 
**Red Boy:**
Mo Boy!?

 
**Sanzang:**
Where do you think you're going? You know that neither the Fire Cloud Cave nor the Sky Scraping Cave is that way.

 
**Red Boy:**
Where I go is none of your business.

 
**Red Boy:**
Since I just lost to the heinous Sanzang group, I'm just gonna hide until things die down.

 
**Sanzang:**
...If you want to see your father so much, how come you don't go home?

 
**Sanzang:**
You adored your father so much!

 
**Red Boy:**
I don't adore him, I HATE him!

 
**Red Boy:**
Anyway... I can't go back to that miserable house now.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
You are a runaway? I see, you wanted to defeat us so you could go home with pride.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Still, your father did raise an obnox&ndash; sorry, kind person like you. You don't need to bring him any gifts, oink!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I'm sure he will welcome you with open arms. Come on, go home now and take us to where the treasures are, oink!

 
**Red Boy:**
You're making it sound nice, but you're really annoying, you know!?

 
**Red Boy:**
Not only that... While my father may be really cool, my mother is...

 
**Red Boy:**
She's like a dump truck with busted brakes, to put it mildly...

 
**Red Boy:**
She's just extremely scary... My dad is usually tough, but even he's kinda whipped by my mom...

 
**Red Boy:**
If you are going to proceed, be careful, Sanzang!
It's better for you not to get involved with that woman!

 
## Volume 4: "Flaming Mountain: That Mountain is Very Fun!"
 
**Sanzang:**
Guys! Those mountains there must be so much fun!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What is it, all of a sudden?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Hey, don't jinx us like that.
 

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
...? Our master seems to be very hyper.
I wonder what's up with her?

 
**Sha Wujing:**
We defeated Red Boy. In that case, our next big obstacle is the Flaming Mountains.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...On a different note, my master...
We are being followed.

 
**Sanzang:**
Did you sense their presence? That's fine.
It's natural that we're being targeted by demons.

 
**Sanzang:**
It's actually rather convenient for us.
We can lose them in the Flaming Mountains up ahead!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
...Hot... It's...so...hot... Oink... [♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru, to be honest...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Despite my appearance, I can't stand the heat...
It's like I'm going to get roasted...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Yes... These evil mountains are worse than expected.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
The flames here don't extinguish with rain, nor do they burn out. They say they can even melt the toughest iron.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
No wonder Servants, much less normal humans, would want to avoid this place...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's like hell on Earth...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Don't tell me...
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Of course! I mean, those mountains are definitely interesting!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
My master, he's saying, “It's not just about having fun!” Oink!

 
**Sanzang:**
That's because you haven't had enough training!
Perfect, let's earn you some Training Points right now!

 
**Sanzang:**
This is the Buddha's providence!
You just need to get used to hardships!

 
**Sanzang:**
We can't get to Tianzhu without crossing these burning mountains! Never!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
A-Any specific plans!?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Don't worry about it.

 
**Sanzang:**
Aside from the demons, I too had anticipated these Flaming Mountains.

 
**Sanzang:**
I've piled on merits during my journey to acquire scriptures, so I can walk freely on fire.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
The ascetic exercise of fire-walking, huh?

 
**Sanzang:**
This hellfire, too, was once just a leaping flame from the Eight Trigrams Furnace up in heaven.

 
**Sanzang:**
If it's a trial from the Buddha, this fire will surely die if I walk through it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...I wonder if it really will be that easy?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I have a bad feeling.
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Just watch.
...Although I might need some time!

 
**Sanzang:**
(Inhale... Exhale...)
(Inhale... Exhale...)

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I wanna see♪
how brave our master is♪

 
**Sanzang:**
(Gulp)

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...She went for it.
She's really walking on the flame...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
She's gone.
I didn't think she would really do it, oink.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
But still, speaking from my experience as a roasted pig... Even if you can walk on fire, there's still the intense heat and smoke, you know?

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Ah! You're right! I should have thought about that!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We have to save her!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Run, White Dragon Horse! Bring her back here!
 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Cough...cough cough... Ugh...
I thought I was gonna die...

 
**Sanzang:**
Apparently, flesh burns even if it's not touching the fire... So that's what it means to smoke something...

 
**Sanzang:**
If I wasn't wearing the Tathagata's kasaya, I would have turned into coal...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
W-Was it fun?
 
**Sanzang:**
Beyond uncool... These mountains were not fun at all... (Sniff)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Don't make us worry!
 
**Sanzang:**
I'm... I'm beyond sorry... I have learned my lesson...

 

 
**Sanzang:**
But...

 
**Sanzang:**
It's different... It's completely different!
They're not the Flaming Mountains I know!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
What do you mean, my frizzy-haired master?

 
**E：???:**
...pai...Senpai...are...there...!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I hear a voice!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Mash!

 
**Mash:**
Oh...thank goodness... I've been waiting so long, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Doctor! Please come to the Command Room immediately!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Oh. A transmission from Chaldea?

 
**Mash:**
The line's very unstable...
I will put it briefly before the signal cuts off!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
...Oh.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
No, it's nothing. You just talk with them, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister].

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Yes, take your time. We'll cover you.

 
**Sanzang:**
Those are...the demons that we drove off in the mountains!? They're coming this way...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Why are we being attacked now of all times!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'll leave it to you, my fellow disciples!
 

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...I think I got the rough idea, Mash!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Noted. So, what does the Doctor say?
 
**Mash:**
The Doctor is here too, but he's a little busy at the moment!

 
**Mash:**
So I will relay the message for now!

 

 
**Mash:**
...And that was the report on the summoning experiment, and the analysis on this unexpected incident.

 
**Mash:**
The situation is not resolved yet. We can't let our guard down.

 
**Mash:**
However, I'm surprised... To think there would be this much time lag between us!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
It has already been a month since we first departed from Tartar territory.

 
**Mash:**
On our side, it's only been four days since the accident
&mdash;Oh...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm still detecting Servant readings around the Flaming Mountains. I even picked up traces of potent Ether.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I suspect some kind of crazy experiment with magecraft. It must've been conducted by a high-ranking Caster as well.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That's probably...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
A mage that can hover over the Flaming Mountains?
 

 
**Blavatsky:**
Xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa!

 
**Blavatsky:**
Great! Eternal flame of Sanat Kumara!
I will boil down this Dagda's Cauldron like it was jam!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
A UFO!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
It's shooting a beam into the volcano!?
 

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
&mdash;I don't know who's been summoned, but I'm sure she's a troublesome Servant, oink.

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm at a loss for words, too. But I'm sure this is also the Buddha's unwavering will.

 
**Mash:**
Xuanzang... Sanzang? I see... so you are a woman!

 
**Mash:**
Oh no... The signal is unstable... The communication...
I can't...correct...time difference...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru! Make sure you tell Sanzang what we talked about.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also tell her... that she herself is the key!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
The transmission got cut off again. I wonder when we will be able to communicate with them again.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
They seem to be having difficulty bringing us back to Chaldea.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I'm pretty sure it's because Mash is not here. She would normally have set up the summoning circle for us.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...We cannot afford to turn back now, either.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
The idea of heading to Tianzhu and being at the mercy of Buddha's guidance doesn't sound too absurd anymore.

 
**Sanzang:**
Eh... So you agreed to travel with me half-heartedly?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Hmmm... For Shuwen, he's content as long as he gets to fight powerful enemies.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Maybe I'm the same? But what about [♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru?

 
**Sanzang:**
...What...do you think? Fujimaru?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
There must be light at the end of this tunnel!
 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;Of course! I won't give up after only one or two lifetimes!

 
**Sanzang:**
Because this is my story!
Thank you, Fujimaru!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
The key must lie within the scriptures we gather.
 
**Sanzang:**
The skinny guy from Chaldea said the same thing. In that case, then I'm truly dancing on top of the Buddha's palm...

 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
&mdash;Brothers, wait.

 
**H：???:**
The Flaming Mountains... They are a test.

 
**Sanzang:**
Uh!?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Oh, a new face? At any rate, not one we have seen in Chaldea.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Is that the one who's been following us?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Twintails and a Chinese dress?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ugh... You are... Ugh...
I feel like I can almost remember you...

 
**Sanzang:**
Why? It's so frustrating! This intense feeling of déjà vu is suffocating...

 
**H：???:**
Impossible. Can not remember.

 
**H：???:**
That memory. Inside. This scripture.

 
**Sanzang:**
!?

 
**H：???:**
&mdash;Lamentable. Xuanzang Sanzang. Once pure and holy. Currently despicable. Mediocre woman.

 
**H：???:**
No will to sacrifice thyself. Bereft tolerance and benevolence. Know there is... no shortcut to Tianzhu.

 
**H：???:**
Simply put. You. No longer fit as Qitian Dasheng's master.

 
**Sanzang:**
Uh! (Shocked)

 
**H：???:**
Chat. Completed.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Twintails gave her a lecture...
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
You're wrong, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister]. If the hair doesn't reach the shoulders, it's more appropriate to call it “pigtails,” oink.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Flying away on wheels... I'm jealous.
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
That person might appear collected, but in truth, she was agitated to the point that she abandoned her role as an observer and interfered...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Yeah. She seemed like she knew our master well... Well?

 
**Sanzang:**
To be honest... I can't quite remember...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
I see. Your memory has been locked away.
However... I have an idea as to who she really is.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
That flaming spear must be the Fire-tipped Spear...
And those bangles she wore must be the Universe Ring...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
In addition, her young appearance...
Although she does speak in a strange tone...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
It appears that she might be Prince Nezha, the Marshal of the Central Altar&mdash; One with a name as well-known as Qitian Dasheng, Sun Wukong.

 
**Sanzang:**
Ne...zha...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Don't underestimate that young warrior.
She's a doll made entirely of Paopei.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
In Chaldea's terminology, she would probably be called a Noble Phantasm Human. I feel I must cross swords with that warrior.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Sensei's bad habit is back...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Didn't it seem like she was worrying about Lu Bu?
 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;?

 

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
She left with the scripture that contains the master's memory.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
So we came up dry this time.
It seems like we can't cheat.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
There's always someone watching...
I guess that's the same in every country.

 
**Sanzang:**
...Banana Leaf...Fan...

 
**Sanzang:**
I remember now!
Yes, the Banana Leaf Fan!

 
**Sanzang:**
Listen, we took the wrong steps. We need a Noble Phantasm... An item to cross the Flaming Mountains!

 
**Sanzang:**
We need the Banana Leaf Fan!
Princess Iron Fan's Noble Phantasm!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Banana Leaf Fan?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Princess Iron Fan?
 

 
## Volume 5: "Banana Cave: Demonic Lady, Princess Iron Fan"
 
**Sanzang:**
In order to extinguish the wild flames of the Flaming Mountains and get to Tianzhu, we definitely need the “Banana Leaf Fan.”

 
**Sanzang:**
And Princess Iron Fan, the one who resides in the Banana Leaf Cave, is the wielder of said fan.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
A world-renowned beauty, also known as the Demonic Lady, a Rakshesa. I wonder what kind of beautiful madam she is?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Yeah, an older married woman doesn't sound bad. Anyway, a beautiful lady is beautiful even if she is someone else's wife.

 
**Sanzang:**
Hey you! Don't get excited about the “someone else's wife” part. Keep it to yourself!

 
**Sanzang:**
Anyway, it's impossible to predict what kind of people we'll meet on this journey...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Based on what Mo Boy said, I can take a guess...

 
**Red Boy:**
No joke! No joke! My mom is so scary!

 
**F：???:**
Red Boy.

 
**Red Boy:**
GAH! Mom! Sorry, I was eating some potato chips!

 
**F：???:**
Correction. You will address me as “Mother,” or else I will cut that infected tongue out.

 
**Red Boy:**
Sorry, Mom! Please don't cut my tongue off!

 
**F：???:**
I will tolerate staying out overnight without permission... but did you wash your hands when you got home?

 
**Red Boy:**
I did! Very thoroughly for about five seconds!
Then dried them with the Banana Leaf Fan!

 
**F：???:**
That explains the mess in the bathroom. What happens if those germs get spread around the castle?

 
**F：???:**
I've told you to carry disposable towels with you so many times... Hmmm? Did you rinse your mouth after returning home?

 
**Red Boy:**
Of course! For about three seconds while drinking cola!

 
**Red Boy:**
Hear my beautiful voice. We have a similar voice, right? Genetically mother and child!

 
**F：???:**
...Red Boy. What's that scratch on your cheek?

 
**Red Boy:**
(Gasp)

 
**Red Boy:**
Just a scratch! It's nothing!
Just put some saliva on it and&mdash;

 
**F：???:**
&mdash;It seems I need to teach you a lesson.
To the medical room. I will treat you myself.

 
**Red Boy:**
Ahhhhhh, I'm sorry, Mom!

 
**Red Boy:**
I don't wanna wash my face in a bucket of peroxide again!

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...It's kind of like an army torture scene.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Too much enthusiasm for education...
Kids grow up open-minded when left free, but...

 
**Sanzang:**
Either way, she's nobody's fool...
We did beat Red Boy, but didn't kill him.

 
**Sanzang:**
There's no reason Princess Iron Fan would get mad.
I'm sure we can just talk it out!

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Rejected & please leave now.

 
**Sanzang:**
You wouldn't even consider it!?

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
There have been no reports of anyone falling ill around the Flaming Mountains.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Those flames must have strong anti-bacterial effects.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
But no one is alive either!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Oh, come on!
 

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
I am quite offended that you would criticize my charity work.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
There are many uses for the Banana Leaf Fan.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
However, I cannot lend it to you for a trivial reason like extinguishing a mountain fire.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...By the way, where is the Ox-Demon King?

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Ox-Demon King... My partner is not here in this castle. He must be wandering about...

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Even Red Boy is following his bad example...
My patience is just about running out.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's not a good idea to take your frustration out on your son.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
My principle of education is perfect!
I even allow my son independence!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Just allowing?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Are you tolerant?
 

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Um... Well...

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
...Fujimaru, was it?
Did you come here to provoke me?

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
I'm always furious... at this unsanitary world... at the fact that accursed disease runs rampant everywhere.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Yes! Travelers like you are especially beyond help!

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Greedy for repletion, knowledge, and pleasure; living as you desire. You would dig up buried relics and wake dormant indigenous diseases.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Surely you're going about spreading a pandemic of pallidness. You're nothing but a walking compost!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
That's not true! I simply bought some buns, and threw the leftovers on the street!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
It's charity for the animals. I litter. With no hesitation.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
&mdash;I am so careless. There is one facility this mountain is missing.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
The chef with the red cape said, “the pig is a very useful domestic animal. The only part you can't use is its scream.”

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
Let's test those words.
Don't worry, I'm a nurse.

 
**Princess Iron Fan:**
I'm used to people writhing and screaming in pain. Scream like you could tear up the sky!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Phew, good response to provocation, deathly nurse!
I'll leave the rest to you, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister]!

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
I don't get along with ladies who don't understand humor!

 
**Sanzang:**
Fine, I'll accept the challenge!
You guys, I'm counting on you!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Sanzang:**
So...this is the Banana Leaf Fan?
Looks pretty different than the legends...

 
**Sanzang:**
Doesn't it look...like a certain holy sword?
Is it even okay for a monk to hold a sword?

 
**Sanzang:**
It is said that in order to cut the root of the fire from the Flaming Mountains, one needs to fan the flame forty-nine times. But she said that since this is EX-ranked, you just need to fan it once.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Princess Iron Fan handed out the scripture she possessed obediently. I cannot fathom the reason that only the Banana Leaf Fan would be a fake.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Anyhow, once we use it, we'll know if it's fake or not, oink.

 
**Sanzang:**
That's true. I'll try!
Here we go&mdash;

 
**Sanzang:**
Ex...calibanana Leaf Fan!

 
**Sanzang:**
Amazing! It's gone! It blew all the fire away!

 
**Sanzang:**
So all that fire-walking training for nothing?
Well, never mind!

 
**Sanzang:**
Fujimaru! We did it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Um, so only the Ox-Demon King is left?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Let's hope the Ox-Demon King is understanding.

 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;Yes!

 
## Volume 6: "Sky Scraping Cave: Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, Ox-Demon King"
 
**Ox-Demon King:**
I am the eldest of a fraternity of demon brothers whose names are renowned even up in heaven&mdash;
I am the Nine-Headed Ox-Demon King!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Hereafter, you may refer to me as Ox-Demon King.
No need to prostrate yourselves. Just relax.

 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;Yes, Your Majesty.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Um... Ox? Cow?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
You&mdash; What are you looking at?
My eyes are up here.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
I must commend you for your efforts. You traveled all the way from Tang, even crossing the Flaming Mountains...

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
...Rumor has it that my son, Red Boy, caused you trouble?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
No need to tense up.
I am not being sarcastic.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
You may laugh at me for being a bad parent.

 
**Sanzang:**
Not at all Oh, by the way.

 
**Sanzang:**
We...um...kind of forcibly borrowed this from your wife.

 
**Sanzang:**
The Excalibanana Leaf Fan.

 
**Sanzang:**
We understand it is... your prized possession. We would like to return it now.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
&mdash;Yes, you have my gratitude once again.
Then let me move on to important matters.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
O eminent Tang Monk, Xuanzang Sanzang&mdash;
This is the scripture that has been entrusted to me.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
And this is the other scripture Nezha gave me when she visited this castle earlier.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Nezha did that?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
You may have both of these scriptures.
It is the Buddha's will.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Meaning, your journey ends here.

 
**Sanzang:**
...Wh-What did you say?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
I said it's the Buddha's will.
You now have all six scriptures.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
&mdash;The Buddha gave me a mission.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
The Buddha said he sealed your memory of the realization of the transient nature of the five desires into the scriptures scattered along the trip.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
The five desires are sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and tactility.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
In other words, the attachment that arises from contact with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
This kind of explanation probably sounds unnecessary to you, though, right?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
One, two, three, four, five... What's the last one?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
The last of the six scriptures is “meaning.”
The attachment produced by the heart.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Ending your journey here and being satisfied from the bottom of your heart will recover the enlightenment you lost&mdash;!

 
**Sanzang:**
What... What? Wait. Wait!

 
**Sanzang:**
My journey doesn't end here!
It still continues!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm going to Tianzhu! That's why I've traveled this far!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
You already have all the scriptures!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Do you not understand!? It is the Buddha's mercy, Xuanzang Sanzang.

 
**Sanzang:**
But what'll happen with them?
What's going to happen to my dear disciples?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Your apprentices will continue on to Tianzhu.
That will bring them back to the world they belong to.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
You, too, must have a place to go back to.

 
**Sanzang:**
...A place to go back to... My house in Chang'an...

 
**Sanzang:**
...No! I want to continue my journey!

 
**Sanzang:**
I haven't accomplished anything!
I appreciate the scriptures, but that's not it!

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm not ready to recite them correctly.
I'm not there yet!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
How unreasonable you are...

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
The scriptures of the Buddha possess an inherent value to the common folk. They do not care who is reciting them 
 
**Ox-Demon King:**
If you cannot realize that, you sure are far from enlightenment.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
No need to worry, though.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Let me blow your attachment away and send you back to the furthest ends of the Far East with my fan, the Excalibanana Leaf Fan.

 
**Sanzang:**
...I see... This is my own battle.

 
**Sanzang:**
Fujimaru... You guys shouldn't come...

 
**Sanzang:**
Otherwise it will make the Buddha angry and you won't be able to return.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
...O Xuanzang Sanzang.
The monk I temporarily revered as my master.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
If you think of me as someone who cleverly reflects on the consequences before fighting my enemies, you're wrong.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Yeah. We're Servants after all.
We don't have anywhere to go back to.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Returning to the Throne of Heroes means we will disappear. Chaldea is an exception, but we can't return there quite yet.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
There is a place I want to go back to.
But I'll just fight, have fun, and die, though.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
And this big dude here, it's like preaching to whatchamacallit.

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanzang:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
Fujimaru ...No, my unworthy number one disciple? What about you?

 
**Sanzang:**
You are not a Servant.
You should go back to those dear to you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You're dear to me, too.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Do you really need to ask that?
 

 
**Sanzang:**
Oh...you...DUMMY!

 
**Sanzang:**
You're all so fearless, you stupid pupils!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
&mdash;This is the final warning!
You will be disobeying the Buddha!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Get out of the way, Ox-Demon King!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
West, here we come! To the west!
 

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Ox-Demon King:**
I...It's...

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
It's not my fault!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
I only made one wish in exchange for complying with the Buddha!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
Princess Iron Fan's table and tablecloth and tableware and table napkins! Everything!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
They're all full of that pungent odor of disinfectant.
So I asked if he could please do something about it!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
She cooks homey and delicious British cuisine... But that odor ruins everything... I can't bear it anymore... (Shudder)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So that's why her food sucks?

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
...Whew. I apologize for the unsightly manner.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
A fair warning, Xuanzang Sanzang.
I do not guarantee anything on your way from here on.

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
You will most likely not have the Buddha's protection either.

 
**Sanzang:**
Don't worry, Ox-Demon King.
Do you think my faith will waver because of that?

 
**Sanzang:**
Besides, that's what makes a journey a journey!

 
**Ox-Demon King:**
All right... Then I wish you and your disciples good luck&mdash;

 
## Final Volume: "Tianzhu"
 
**Sanzang:**
Gandhara is sooo biiiig♪ On the other side of Tianzhuuuu lies a mandalaaaa♪ Lalalaaa♪

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Where is Tianzhu anyway?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I thought we were headed west? Isn't this south?
 

 
**Sha Wujing:**
You're asking where “Tianzhu” is?
It's India, of course.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
India? Oh, at this pace I thought we were going to Rome or somewhere over there.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
At the time Xuanzang Sanzang arrived in Tianzhu, Mahayana Buddhism had already perished and even the famous Jetavana Monastery had fallen into ruin.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
It is said that what precious teachings survived were left in the hands of a few monasteries and rare scriptures...

 
**Sanzang:**
What are you muttering about?
Look!

 
**Sanzang:**
A river! The Great Golden River! We're finally here!
Oh, dear old Ganges!

 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;!??

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Namastee!? The most powerful ★5 Indian duo!?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Wow, what glares!

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ugh... What are we going to do?

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
...Are they gatekeepers? Those two look like trouble. They look like they don't care a thing about Buddhism.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
More than anything, they can't take a joke.
Well, in a way, Karna does have a sense of humor.

 
**Nezha:**
They. Underworld. Guardians.

 
**Sanzang:**
Nezha.
I knew you would come.

 
**Nezha:**
Understand now&mdash; Xuanzang?

 
**Sanzang:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
...Yes, I do. Nezha.

 
**Sanzang:**
Those two are great heroes as well as demi-gods, the embodiments of my fear...

 
**Sanzang:**
The fear of going to the outside world, the anxiety that I can't brush off.

 
**Sanzang:**
I was summoned...as Chaldea's Servant.

 
**Sanzang:**
But since I believed I had reached enlightenment and abandoned all earthly desires I refused the summon.

 
**Sanzang:**
The Buddha will never concern himself with the extinction of humanity. To him, it is only one of the many ripples in existence.

 
**Sanzang:**
If so, it is only my selfishness as a “human being.”

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
(That's why the summoning experiment was incomplete...)

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
(But it's probably Da Vinci's fault.)

 
**Sanzang:**
I don't want to leave my disciples anymore...
I don't want to die alone anymore...

 
**Sanzang:**
...Still. Even if I were on my own, as long as I can continue this journey, I would take that opportunity no matter what.

 
**Sanzang:**
Sun Wukong is not here now, but&mdash;

 
**Nezha:**
...Xuanzang. I too. Give assistance.

 
**Sanzang:**
Nezha, you?
No, there's no need for that!

 
**Sanzang:**
You are the Buddha's messenger, sent to complete this broken scroll.

 
**Sanzang:**
Or perhaps you're like a lens for me to perceive the Buddha in this hollow world.

 
**Sanzang:**
Isn't that right, Nezha?

 
**Nezha:**
...Understood. Will. Withdraw.

 
**Nezha:**
Chat. Completed.

 
**Sanzang:**
...Nezha's gone.

 
**Sanzang:**
I wonder if it's possible to summon her as a Servant?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Of course! We needed more cheongsam Servants.
 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Hey, my outfit's slit is just as suggestive!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
More importantly, is Nezha a boy or a girl?
 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;Huh? Well, even the Buddha himself doesn't know much about our Prince Nezha in a Chinese dress♪

 

 
**Sanzang:**
Well, our latest issue has been overcome!
I will not stop, regardless of who my opponent is!

 
**Sanzang:**
Guys, follow me to the end!
Let's conquer the last trial, that great river!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Senpai... Senpai!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
&mdash;Mash!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Here, I'm here!

 
**Mash:**
Please answer, Senpai! I can't believe there's no reception over here, either!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, the anchor for Rayshifting has arrived!
You can come back to Chaldea!

 
**Mash:**
We can only supply magical energy for a few more minutes, though! So...please...

 
**Mash:**
Come back!
&mdash;Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...!

 
**Sanzang:**
This...must be the Buddha's guidance...
No, maybe it's your own luck?

 
**Sanzang:**
Or...

 
**Sha Wujing:**
The right time.

 
**Sha Wujing:**
Xuanzang Sanzang. You will remain here, on the other side, and depart again for the new land?

 
**Sanzang:**
&mdash;Yes. Thank you for your pointed advice.
Sha Wujing&mdash; Li Shuwen.

 
**Sanzang:**
Your expertise with the spear was as great as that of the Sha Wujing I know.

 
**Sanzang:**
Your levelheadedness kept me from crying my eyes out during this journey.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
My turn. To tell you the truth, we believe in very different gods.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
But people learn a lot from each other using the opportunities given to them by the gods.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
So, even though I believe in a different god, this trip has been a valuable experience. Thank you for the rare experience.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
Oh, and all the treasures I collected during this journey... I'll put them in a savings account under your name.

 
**Zhu Bajie:**
When we meet again, I will host a big party, oink.

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm looking forward to it.
Zhu Bajie&mdash; Formidable King David.

 
**Sanzang:**
Any dilemma, any situation we met, you faced with a light heart, without panicking or feeling discouraged.

 
**Sanzang:**
I can't be like you, but I will remind myself of you when I'm in trouble.

 
**Sanzang:**
Zhu Bajie, full of desire, who never lost that quirky personality.

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;☆

 
**Sanzang:**
Umm? Y-Yes, right? Yes, yes! (I don't know what he's saying, but what a strong handshake.)

 
**Sanzang:**
You were great to ride on!
Next time, I'll have a saddle ready!

 
**White Dragon Horse:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]

 
**Sanzang:**
And lastly...

 
**Sanzang:**
If I ever gain the Buddha's guidance again and manifest as a Servant in the future...

 
**Sanzang:**
Fujimaru... I will take you as my disciple again.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
In that case, I want to be your number one disciple again!
 
**Sanzang:**
Whaaaat? Isn't that a bit presumptuous? Hahaha.

 
**Sanzang:**
You have many people dear to you waiting for you at Chaldea, right?

 
**Sanzang:**
But for being a fantastic neophyte who plays a key role in the survival of humanity, I might give you that side benefit.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
If that's the case, I want you to call me Master!
 
**Sanzang:**
That's...um, well, that depends on the merits you will have accrued by that day.

 

 
**Sanzang:**
...That's why I won't say goodbye.
Instead, I will recite a blissful sutra.

 
**Sanzang:**
So you will have perfect health, okay?
&mdash;Ahem!

 
**Sanzang:**
aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Until we meet again!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Ending with a sutra is not really...
 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Thank goodness!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oops... Well, that was close. Very close.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If it hadn't gone well, Mash would have mashed me.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wonder if the others embroiled in this accident have made their way back to Da Vinci's lab?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, I'm gonna go and complain to that painter.

 
**Mash:**
(Sigh)... Shall we have some tea instead?

 
**Mash:**
It seems like they found some precious Chinese tea along with the roll of scriptures.

 
**Mash:**
Apparently it's called... “Records of the Journey to the Far West with Fujimaru.”

 
**Mash:**
I think the tea will be the perfect complement to a recounting of your adventure.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Okay, leave it to me.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Recount? With pleasure.
