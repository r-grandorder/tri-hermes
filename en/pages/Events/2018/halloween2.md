# Halloween Comeback! Super Ghouls'n Pumpkins - The Seed of Adventure

## Prelude
 
**A：Elisabeth:**
&mdash;We've finally made it here, me.
Are you ready for this?

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Also, is my makeup on right?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
...Of course, me. We'll defeat the witch and take back Castle Csejte!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
And of course my makeup's perfect! It's me we're talking about!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Yup! By the way... Why are there two of us?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Well, it doesn't really matter,

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
If you ask me, by splitting into two, our idol coefficient's gone up several thousand times.

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Even my idol frenemy got a bride costume so...

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
That's right! If there are two of her, there should be two of me!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Exactly! Smart thinking, me! And now, the most important thing, without a doubt, is...

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
...my new performance...

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
“Heartbreak★Castle Csejte Heaven and Hell Dual Concert - Sweet Bloody Halloween Special: What The... It's So Sweet!”

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
...is about to begin!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Ticket sales are projected to completely sell out!
I had to reserve some tickets for Chaldea!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
As such, I can't let the schedule get messed up, now, can I?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
...Which is why I need to take back the castle, me!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Okay, let's go!
Ready, set, go!

 
**Both:**
Excuse me!

 
**???:**
Who's making all that noise? It's the middle of the night! Why can't you be quiet?

 
**???:**
...Hmm. Why, if it isn't two ugly little girls!

 
**???:**
Oooh... You little shrimp aren't very fashionable at all. What a sin it is to be like you!

 
**???:**
And I am disgusted. Disgusted!
You cling to the glories of the past...

 
**???:**
You're so focused on something that you fail to see the bigger picture!

 
**???:**
Yet I will accept that my glory must have blinded you.
So sorry!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Huh? Oh, uh, no. But thank you.

 
**???:**
Humph! Don't get the wrong idea. It's not like I was trying to be considerate or anything when I said that!

 
**???:**
Now get back to your dank little caves, you scrawny lizards!

 
**???:**
Because, as you're quite well aware, staying out late is very bad for the skin!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Tch... She gives off such a powerful aura just by standing there...! Her idol coefficient is really high like always!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Jeez! I understand why I would shake in the presence of a powerful enemy, but for now, just concentrate!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
I-I know that!
Now get ready, witch!

 
**???:**
You make me laugh! I've never gotten myself ready for anything! Because&mdash;

 
**???:**
Because my heart is free as a feather!
I have no worries about anything!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Ugh... this self-confidence and boastful attitude...
She reminds me of someone...!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
She's like a woman I see every single morning... when I'm checking myself in the mirror...!

 
**???:**
And, obviously, the word “witch” is inappropriate for me.

 
**???:**
“Witch” in this region refers not to an embodiment of beauty such as me, but rather to that Halloween girl next to you, right?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
This is just a stage outfit based on the concept of a witch! I'm the mistress of this castle!

 
**???:**
Hahaha!
Hahahahahahaha!

 
**???:**
You may not look that great, but you've got a real sense of humor! It's tasteless, low-class, and ridiculous!

 
**Both:**
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?

 
**???:**
Hahaha. If you're telling me that the job of a castle mistress entails wearing a ridiculous outfit like that, even I can't help but laugh.

 
**???:**
Actually, I'm tired from laughing so much.
I'm going to bed.

 
**???:**
I'm the owner of this castle now. Naturally, I am also assuming direct control of these lands as well.

 
**???:**
Being a ruler is much too difficult for tryhard lizards like the two of you! Now be good little commoners and quietly take your leave!

 
**???:**
Hahaha! But I don't know if freeloading nobles like you can handle the life of a commoner!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
What...!?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
What did you say!?

 
**???:**
Don't scream at me.
It's like listening to surround sound.

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Shut up!
You took my Castle Csejte without asking!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
You're not even from the right culture anyway!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
You don't match Castle Csejte at all!

 
**???:**
...? Are you so excited that you haven't even bothered to look outside?

 
**???:**
Hahaha. It's too late.
Behold the snake that foretells the end!

 
**Both:**
Huh?

 
**Both:**
Something weird's sticking out!?

 
**???:**
Oh, you're back! Good evening!
You do know I'm actually really busy?

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
What is that!?
Why is my castle a pyramid!?

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Actually, why is the pyramid upside down!?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
The castle's all smooshed! All you did was stack it on top! Talk about cutting corners!

 
**???:**
Hahaha, you've got me there, little lizards!
But I'll tell you one thing:

 
**???:**
This is remodeling!

 
**???:**
Farewell to that nasty, disgusting prison castle!
What this era wants is simplicity!

 
**???:**
The golden ratio is the basis of beauty in this world! That's right! Just like me! Exactly like me!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
No, it looks really out of place. I mean, this is Europe... Besides, how is that “remodeling”!?

 
**???:**
Avant-garde!
Hakone! Art park! Museum!

 
**???:**
Anyway, this castle is under my control!
But I understand beauty. I'm not a monster.

 
**???:**
If you insist on holding a concert, out of respect for the former owners, I will offer you a place.

 
**???:**
Yes... I know exactly where!
How about that stable?

 
**???:**
That's rock n' roll style right there! You can jam in the same kind of place that holy man was born in!

 
**???:**
Hahaha! It's fine, it's fine. No need to thank me with words! Just bow down before me in gratitude!

 
**Both:**
Hell no!!

 
**???:**
Humph. So negotiations failed, huh?
...How disappointing.

 
**???:**
I guess I have no choice then.
Behold my power!

 
**???:**
...Is what I'd like to say, but fighting directly isn't elegant. It's bad for my skin, too.

 
**???:**
So I'll leave that to my stand-in.
Fierce, ugly knight of steel, come forth!

 
**Tristan:**
Tristan the Tragic has arrived.

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
What...?

 
**Lancelot:**
As has Lancelot the Sorrowful.

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
No way...!

 
**???:**
Now then, I have to get back to my book.
Finish them by the time I'm done, you losers!

 
**???:**
Of course, if you fail, you're banished. I have no use for men whose only redeeming quality is their beauty.

 
**Tristan:**
How sad... You're underestimating our power, aren't you?

 
**Lancelot:**
I agree with Tristan. We'll have this finished before you can read the next sentence.

 
**Lancelot:**
Now then. It's time for you to go.

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
H-Hey, time out!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
We're here to fight with that nasty woman over there!

 
**???:**
A truly good mistress has talented retainers.
Heh... I'm so perfect.

 
**???:**
Oh, I'll give you one last bit of advice.

 
**???:**
Remember this face, for it is my consolation to you.

 
**???:**
After all, they say seeing beautiful things makes you more beautiful, right?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Why, you...!
Let's do this, me!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Wah!?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Funyah!?

 
**Tristan:**
Now go. We weren't told to take your lives.

 
**Lancelot:**
You cannot beat us, let alone our mistress.

 
**Lancelot:**
You need to grow at least 10 years older, cute little girls.

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Waah! We lost to a couple of literal homewreckers!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
W-We'll get you for this!
You COUGAR LOVER!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
We'll be back! Real soon!

 
**Lancelot:**
Hahaha. I look forward to it.
Now let's go, Lord Tristan.

 
**Tristan:**
...Homewreckers...

 
**Lancelot:**
(He's genuinely shocked that she called him that!)

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
(Panting)
W-We made it out okay, somehow, but...

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
What do we do, me!?
We can't hold our concert at this rate...

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
I hate to say it, but we can't handle this on our own.

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
...Uncle Vlad is away on business...

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
And Tamamo Cat said, “Woof! I'm leaving on a journey for paws unknown!” and quit her job.

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
By the way, do you think she was lying about why she quit? Were we tricked?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
It doesn't matter.
No, I mean, it does matter, but...

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Waah! If only my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] were here!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
No sense in complaining about what we can't have.

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Ugh! I'm so pathetic, relying on others and whatnot!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Humph. S-So what, me!?
Do you have any good ideas?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
N-No, but...

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Then stop complaining!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Wh-What!? You don't have any ideas either, do you?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
You're stupid, so just shut up!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Argh!
You're me, so you're stupid too!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
I'm a Caster, which makes me one rank higher than you in intelligence!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
There is no such stat!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
...And you know what? I'm not sure it's a good idea for Caster me to be one rank lower in MP either!

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Gah! You know that's a sore spot for me!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
What, you wanna fight!?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
 ＆＄＃〓％＆∧§’（＆（％＆））!!!

 
**A：Elisabeth:**

**A：Elisabeth:**
Huh?

 
**B：Elisabeth:**
Huh? What's this light?

 
**A：Elisabeth:**
Huh? Huh? What!?

 
**Both:**
((Wait! What happened!?))

 
**Both:**
...

 
**Both:**
WHAT IS THIS!?

 
## Section 1: "The Power of Friendship"
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, let's start the briefing!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, you seem more excited than usual.
Did something good happen?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Anyway, let's start the briefing!

What's the matter, Roman?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? Aren't I always like this?
Haha, or maybe it's because I've been staying up late lately.

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, sorry I haven't been able to help you out even though we're in such a tense situation.

Oh, what's wrong, Fujimaru?
You're looking at me strange.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha, maybe you're tired? Still, this is all to save the world, so I want you to do your best!

 

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
Now Fou's looking at the doctor suspiciously.

 
**Mash:**
...Is there something you're hiding from us?

 
**Mash:**
Actually, why is the staff surrounding us right now?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Well, a minor Singularity has been detected, see...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Obviously we can't just leave it there.
I would like you to investigate and correct it.

**Dr. Roman:**
...All right. In any event, please enter the Coffins!
Get ready to Rayshift!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor!?

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The briefing's over, so you need to head over there now!

 
**Mash:**
Wait, Doctor! You still haven't told us where we're Rayshifting to!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, someone dropped some documents here.
This won't do at all.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, your Rayshift destination...
Um, how do you read this again? Uh... I think it was...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Castle Csejte.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah that's it! Got it?
Time to head out!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

Doctor! Did you just mention that one castle name we can never just let slide!?

Oh that's right! It's almost Halloween!

 
**Mash:**
It was supposed to be a cordial gathering, but last year's Death Concert is still haunting us!

Senpai, it's too dangerous! That music will destroy your psyche if you continuously listen to it!

Right!

I have only a bad feeling about this, so I'm going to take a voluntary leave of absence!

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's not going to work! All staff, scrum!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Once we save the world, I'll personally review your current salary!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's time to show them the muscle you've gained from training with Leonidas!

**Dr. Roman:**
In any event, head out!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Go, uh, keep Elisabeth company again this year!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Meaning, just go to her concert, okay? Nothing makes an idol like her sadder than an empty venue! And you shouldn't make idols cry!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Here, I'll even give you some of my glow sticks!
Now then, commence forced Rayshift!

Yes...

I didn't think we would come here again...

 

 
**Mash:**
...Communications seem fine.
Doctor, the Rayshift succeeded.

 
**Mash:**
However, we won't let this slide.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I kind of hope that you will... Anyway, how are things looking over there?

 
**Mash:**
It looks like...a graveyard.

 
**Mash:**
We can get back at the doctor later.
Let's keep moving for now.

 
**Mash:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
Sorry, Master.

 
**Mash:**
If I remember correctly, last year when we came here, there were ghosts all over the forest.

 
**Mash:**
We're in a graveyard, but I don't see any ghosts.
I wonder what's going on.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. I'm getting a reaction of some kind.
It's very close to you.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Hmm... Bugs.

 
**Mash:**
Completely unrelated to Halloween, but a nuisance nonetheless.

 
**Mash:**
Let's take them out!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Phew. The battle is over. Everything has been annihilated, so it should safe.

 
**Mash:**
Shall we head into town, Master? Although I'm pretty sure Servants are going to show up and get in our way...

Up until now you were so optimistic about everything!

 
**Mash:**
It'll be fine. When we get back... Yes, when we get back we'll have Amadeus play us some music!

 
**Mash:**
We can request some really soothing music to listen to...

 

 
**Mash:**
Looks like you're remotivated to continue the mission. Thank goodness...

**???:**
Achoo!

...It's so cold. I didn't know the mountains in the West were this cold... That's a problem... I guess I'm dressed a bit too light...?

 
## Section 2: "Hero Elly Gathers Allies"
 
**Mash:**
...That's strange.
The town doesn't feel like Halloween at all.

 
**Mash:**
...Still, it doesn't seem like it was attacked or anything either.

And all the house lights are on, but I don't see any townspeople walking around...

What about the castle?

Umm...

Castle Csejte...! What a mess!

 
**Mash:**
And on top there's a pyramid...and it's upside down!!

 
**Mash:**
It's just sitting there, Senpai!
Like, boom!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I checked it out. The pyramid and the castle are from different epochs.

The former is obviously older. And the fact that it's crushing the castle like that means...

Yes, but it might be difficult to ask the townsfolk for information...

**Mash:**
I see...

 
**Mash:**
People let their guard down when there's alcohol around. They're more likely to talk... even with newcomers like us.

 
**Mash:**
All right! Let's go!

 

 
**Mata Hari:**
Welcome♪

 
**Mash:**
...Umm.

 
**Mata Hari:**
My my, such young customers.
Welcome to Mata Hari's tavern!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Your one-stop shop for bittersweet meetings and farewells!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Are you seeking traveling companions?

 
**Mash:**
C-Companions?
No, we're fine.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Oh, is that so.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Then perhaps that cute [♂ guy /♀ girl] with you came to find some other kind of companionship?

 
**Mata Hari:**
I wouldn't mind spending the night with you, you know...

No, we're fine!

R-Right.

 
**Mata Hari:**
That's too bad.

 
**Mash:**
Actually, we'd like to ask about that pyramid...

 
**Mata Hari:**
Oh yes, the pyramid.
It fell from the sky one day. It really was sudden.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Inside it you'll find a queen and the loyal knights who serve her.

 
**Mata Hari:**
They banned Halloween.
Can you believe it?

 
**Mash:**
Banned... Halloween!?

 
**Mata Hari:**
There was a notice from the queen.

 
**Mata Hari:**
“If you object to the way I rule, if you're a reckless savage that dreams of getting rich fast, come and challenge this pyramid.”

 
**Mata Hari:**
...So she has declared.

 
**Mata Hari:**
And so this town is searching for heroes to do just that&ndash;to take on Pyramid Csejte.

 
**Warrior:**
I'll do it! I'm going to get rich off the pyramid's treasure!

 
**Knight:**
Leave the defending to me, you guys!

 
**Monk:**
We need a mage! I'm a priest that only knows how to heal using mundane means!

 
**Thief:**
Heh, leave any doors and chests to me!

 
**Mash:**
So many people from so many different lands... I see.
No wonder it's so lively.

She's chasing after us!
Also, I think I just saw a familiar face!

Maybe that was just my imagination!
But we don't have time for that!

 
**???:**
Waaaaaiiiiit!

 
**Mash:**
Master! Master!

 
**Mash:**
It was basic survival instinct that made us flee, but maybe we should at least listen to what she has to say!?

Y-Yeah! It's bound to be one of the causes of this Singularity, after all!

That's not fair! That's not fair at all!

...Well, let's forget about that for now.

Let's not!

I want to know precisely why no one called me!

I see. So dual Elisabeths were driven out of Castle Csejte by this queen.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Yeah, exactly.
Now do you understand?

 
**Elisabeth:**
The LanCas duo couldn't finish what they started.
So now there's something I must do... For their sake.

Fou's trying to say something, but it's best not to translate it.

Oh? What's going on?
This is...

 
**Mash:**
Elisabeth, who are these people?

 
**Elisabeth:**
The queen's lackeys!
Be careful! They're all pretty strong!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
We are knights in the queen's service.
We fight to purge Halloween.

 
**Queen's Knight:**
Those who speak of or desire to bring back Halloween shall be exiled or sentenced to hard labor, without exception!

 
**Mash:**
That's terrible...!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
And we also received a complaint that this girl over here... is, um... not wearing appropriate attire in public...

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's not true! I'm quite obviously dressed as a hero! ...Wait, I am, right!?

 
**Queen's Knight:**
(Ahem)

 
**Queen's Knight:**
In any event, it's exile or hard labor.
You're going to have to pick one!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I don't have to be afraid of you any longer!
Come, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! We're going to fight!

 
**Mash:**
Wait.

 
**Mash:**
Can you at least tell us why Halloween was banned?

 
**Queen's Knight:**
Because, uh... Because the queen ordered it!

 
**Mash:**
Then we'd like to ask the queen why.

 
**Queen's Knight:**
The world's most lovely queen will not hold an audience with the likes of you!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
Sorry, but we're going to restrain you!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Like hell you are!

 
**Elisabeth:**
If you're going to stand in the way of my concerts and everything I stand for...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...I don't care who you are.
I'll use every ounce of my strength to defeat you!

 
**Mash:**
Looks like there's no way around it.
Let's go, Master!

 
**Mash:**
By the way... Do you keep seeing someone lurking around here?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Queen's Knight:**
W-We've failed...! Retreat! Retreat!

 
**Mash:**
We sent them running, but... they were all quite skilled.

 
**Mash:**
A queen adored by knights of such caliber...
I wonder what she's like.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We'll probably need to meet her if we're going to repair the Singularity.

Not necessary, let's move!

**Elisabeth:**
The legend of the Crimson Hero Elisabeth is going to start right here! That witch needs to brace herself!

 
**Narration:**
Crimson Hero Elisabeth's Adventure has begun!

 
**Mash:**
So why were you in the tavern with that sign?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, that? All I did was say this to the owner lady:

 
**Elisabeth:**
“Now then! I'm looking for some strong, radiant companions! Ones who will put me in the spotlight and worship me!”

 
**Elisabeth:**
“I'll be on vocals. I've never been in a band before. Looking for pros on guitar, bass, and drums.”

 
**Elisabeth:**
When I did, she smiled and just handed the sign to me! Isn't that mean!?

 
**Mash:**
I guess it serves you right...

 
**Lancelot:**
Your Majesty, we have confirmed visitors from Chaldea. It seems they were caught in the Bounded Field that was put up.

 
**Tristan:**
...

 
**???:**
Ha! Oh, I am so perfect, I predicted all of this!
I of course have countermeasures in place!

 
**???:**
With the ultimate gatekeeper on watch, my superiority cannot be challenged... Oh, it's too beautiful...

 
**???:**
I rule this land appropriately, with tolerance and ruthlessness.

 
**Queen's Knight:**
I-If I may, Your Majesty... Will Halloween continue to be banned?

 
**???:**
Dunce! How about going to a salon and cleaning up your dull look first!

 
**???:**
It's too soon for the common fools to celebrate Halloween!

 
**???:**
Holding such a lighthearted festival when the world is in such an unstable state? Pure idiocy!

 
**???:**
Endure with patience, and keep love within your heart! Follow in my footsteps!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
...But everyone was looking forward to Halloween...
My children, too...

 
**???:**
Blasphemy! Backtalk is punishable by death! But, for the sake of your children, I shall give you a day off. With remuneration!

 
**???:**
Lay down your sword and return to your pitiful family at once! That is, if you value your life!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
Er, Your Majesty?
I, uh, I don't quite follow...

 
**Lancelot:**
Just go home.
It means you have tomorrow off.

 
**Queen's Knight:**
...Understood. Then with all due respect, I shall receive your punishment of...paid leave.

 
**Lancelot:**
Now then, my queen.
What would you have us do?

 
**Lancelot:**
Shall we take them on now so we don't have to worry about them later?

 
**???:**
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
You fool!

 
**???:**
If we did that, it'd be like I was afraid of them for some reason!

 
**???:**
I'm sending the knights into town.
It'll prevent the citizens from becoming restless.

 
**???:**
As for you two... Well, there's no need for you to be deployed.

 
**???:**
I know you're planning on hitting on the local girls the second I send you there. Sorry, but things don't always go your way!

 
**Lancelot:**
...No, that's not what I...

 
**Tristan:**
Unbelievable... She sees through our very way of life...

 
**Lancelot:**
No, Lord Tristan. I really just care about the safety of the town.

 
**Tristan:**
...I hear there's a girl with a broken heart at one of the taverns. Apparently her man left her after losing his entire fortune on a bet the other day.

 
**Lancelot:**
Which tavern is that? You mean that cute girl from Ash Tree Tavern on 3rd?

 
**???:**
Ohoho. Maybe you would like to wait in prison instead of your own rooms?

 
**Lancelot:**
Excuse us. We will remain on standby, Your Majesty.

 
**Lancelot:**
Then we shall take our leave.
Please get some rest, my queen.

 
**???:**
I will, of course.
Now leave immediately!

 
**Tristan:**
...

 
**Lancelot:**
Yes, Your Majesty.
...Tristan?

 
**???:**
...?

 
**Tristan:**
...

 
**Tristan:**
... (Snoring)

 
**???:**
...

 
**Tristan:**
...How sad. This intense pain is making me sad.

 
**Lancelot:**
You know, in a way, that was quite impressive...

 
## Section 3: "May King"
 
**Elisabeth:**
First things first.
We should get more people!

 
**Mash:**
Are we not enough on our own...?

 
**Elisabeth:**
No, that's not it! Mash, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], I'm always depending on you!

 
**Elisabeth:**
But we're up against famous knights.
Just the three of us isn't enough!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Also, I'm a fantasy hero. They always have a wide variety of party members to support them!

 
**Elisabeth:**
When I was an idol, I had someone on drums and taiko, woodwind, and more, all to back me up!

One who can use their cure magic for healing!

Healing, huh...

 
**Nurse:**
...Now then, let's begin the treatment.

This is to save you. You will have to endure one or two broken bones, and maybe the loss of an arm or two.
Or three.

Okay, here I go!

The outskirts of town have been dangerous lately.
Pests and werebeasts have been lurking about.

Probably because it's almost Halloween.
The monsters are getting all excited, too.

 
**Robin Hood:**
As a guy who roosts around these parts, I can't sleep at night without setting up some traps. I get all anxious.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Are you sure that's the werebeasts' fault? Is it not just that you need traps around to feel at ease?

If you're going to take on the pyramid, I don't mind lending a hand. That queen's brazen attitude is just too much for me.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I was just thinking that she could use a little punishment.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much!
Elisabeth, we got ourselves a scout!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Scout? You mean someone who looks for potential idols!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
...But I don't feel like joining an agency yet...

 
**Elisabeth:**
What should I do...?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Considering you're a ruler, I really think you should stop daydreaming like that, you know?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Sh-Shut up. Anyway, let's take out those werebeasts!

 
**Elisabeth:**
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], Mash, Robin... Follow me!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I can't have dirty werebeasts attacking my town!

 
**Robin Hood:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Robin, what's wrong?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, nothing. Just thinking about how the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, so to speak...

 
**Robin Hood:**
That dragon girl has no other plan but to rush in.
We'll just have to support her, won't we?

 
**Elisabeth:**
There you are! Hahaha. Something really did get caught!

 
**Elisabeth:**
You look stupid hanging upside down like that!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Elisabeth! You should think about what happened to you a few minutes ago!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I decided to stay positive, and keep anything that happened in the past locked away in my heart!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Well how about you examine some of those things tucked away in your heart, huh?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Yeah, I couldn't forget them even if I wanted to!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Anyway, Green! You're joining us once we take them out!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Sure. Once we get rid of all of them, there's no reason for me to stay in this forest anyway.

 
**Robin Hood:**
This is totally going to be a pain, but I guess I have to.
I'll join you on your Death Tour!

 
**Elisabeth:**
It's not a “Death Tour”!
It's a curing, shiny concert tour!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
Alright, the scout will now scout for us!
You're going to keep your promise, right?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Fine. So what do we do? Barge into the pyramid now?

 
**Elisabeth:**
No, I want one more person, I think.

A mage!
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!

 

 
**Robin Hood:**
Huh. You're going to go scout a mage, huh...
Well, that's fine.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I do know someone, but... um...

 
**Mash:**
Is there a problem?

 
**Mash:**
Is it because they have gone insane, or that they build miniature gardens, or that they're fighting between AC and DC, or that they summon a flying saucer...?

 
**Robin Hood:**
...Well, those would be problems, yeah...
It's just, she's a lot like someone we know.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A lot like who?

 
**Robin Hood:**
(Points silently)

 
**Elisabeth:**
Me?

 
**???:**
(Gasp!)
I just had a feeling of impending disaster!

 
**???:**
But he who runs in the face of the enemy does not deserve the mantle of “pharaoh.”

 
**???:**
No matter what disaster it may be, I shall humbly fight it off!

 
## Section 4: "PHAAARAAAOHHH"
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Hey, are we there yet?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Sure, just wait a little longer.

 
**Mash:**
Robin, Robin.

 
**Mash:**
Um... Who is this mage you're talking about, and how is she like Elisabeth?

 
**Robin Hood:**
They're practically one and the same.
She's just a bit more intelligent.

 
**Robin Hood:**
She's a bright one, but she's narrow-minded. Arrogant. Bossy. Fairly serious, but with a low boiling point.

 
**Robin Hood:**
She jumps to conclusions and goes out of control, leading to disastrous consequences. It's all very painful to watch.

 
**Mash:**
Oh...

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? That's not like me at all.

 
**Both:**
It's just like you.

 
**Elisabeth:**
(Gulp)

 
**Robin Hood:**
She's a pharaoh, and a queen, as well as a self-proclaimed god of the sky and the underworld.

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? Don't you think that's too much description?
Only idols of little talent have that many traits.

 
**Mash:**
Noblewoman, vampire, serial killer, bat wings, dragon horns, idol, dragon girl. Isn't that too much too?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Wait, how come all my traits sound negative!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, hold it. I'm detecting a powerful response...

 
**C：???:**
Who's intruding in my territory this late without an appointment? Begone, impudent ones!

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Mash:**
S-So sudden!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Waaaaah!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Calm down! It's an illusion.
An illusion!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey there, Your Majesty.

 
**C：???:**
May King, you must be mad to bring them here.

 
**C：???:**
We made a pact to protect one another's territory.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Firstly, stop calling me that. It's embarrassing.

 
**Robin Hood:**
And secondly, what's your deal? Bringing out a scary illusion to intimidate us and whatnot?

 
**C：???:**
Well, what did you expect?

 
**C：???:**
I don't know about you and the shield girl, but that woman there has a nasty aura.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Eh? Me?

 
**C：???:**
Indeed. Tell me your name, impudent one.

 
**C：???:**
You're... I don't know...um, like... The fact that I feel a subtle kinship with you is ticking me off!

 
**C：???:**
This may sound sudden, but I hereby declare you my eternal rival! Got it!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Fine by me!

 
**Elisabeth:**
For some reason, when I'm talking to you, my head starts to hurt and it's ticking me off!

 
**C：???:**
I see. So it looks like our opinions align.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Right. That's good.

 
**C：???:**
...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...

 
**Both:**
TELL ME YOUR NAME!

 
**Mash:**
When these two start talking, I get the feeling it will never end, Master!

Huh? Name?
Oh, right. Name. Yes, name.

 

 
**Nitocris:**
My name is Nitocris.
I am a pharaoh from a distant land.

 
**Nitocris:**
The god of the underworld, and the incarnation of the sky god Horus.

 
**Nitocris:**
And now, I study magecraft while I frolic with my phantoms in a deep cave.

 
**Elisabeth:**
My name is Elisabeth Báthory.
As you can see, I'm an idol.

 
**Elisabeth:**
My specialty is idol pop, I suppose. An since I have draconic blood, naturally I also have a breath attack!

 
**Elisabeth:**
And I'm also a distinguished noble. And these wings and horns? Cute, aren't they? Anything else?

 
**Nitocris:**
I see. Now we understand each other well.

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right. I think so too.

 
**Both:**
 
We'll never get along!!

 
**Robin Hood:**
No, I think you two are getting along just fine.

 
**Nitocris:**
How!? She's a typical spoiled Western noble girl!

 
**Nitocris:**
She's the type of woman I hate the most in this world! She needs to suffer more!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Th-That's my line! I hate that “Oh, look at me, I'm a queen” attitude! It makes me want to throw up! Especially since you're an old hag!

 
**Mash:**
(Master, is she talking about Carmilla?)

She's lived a complicated life, too, huh?

 

 
**Elisabeth:**
I can't take this anymore! It's time to duel!
I'll smash your face in with my holy sword!

 
**Nitocris:**
Fine! I'll teach you and your 80s style who's really the boss!

 
**Nitocris:**
That armor is just old! I can't say exactly what's old about it, but it's very old!

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? You don't even know that retro style is the new trend!? What a dummy!

 
**Nitocris:**
The only thing retro we need around here is Egypt!
You moron!

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
RAAARRGGH!

Hey! Please don't take Master away!

Argh! Damn it! We've got no choice but to follow them!

My throat's all warmed up now!

Tch, I can hear those evil sound waves all the way here.

 
**Nitocris:**
It's like the wails of the dead from the underworld! Honestly, it's a genre I like!

 
**Nitocris:**
Idol pop... I guess I can't take it lightly!

 
**Elisabeth:**
What do you mean by wails of the dead!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
The motto of idol pop is “Cute, Cuter, Cutest,” you know!

Heheh. It costs a lot to rent, but this sphinx is the true guardian of my cavern.

 
**Nitocris:**
Pharaoh Ozymandias may not look it, but he runs a very honest business...

 
**Nitocris:**
“Oh, you want to borrow my army of holy beasts?
Then the rental fee is three scarabs a week.”

 
**Nitocris:**
“If you want a Marika Sphinx, add in 10 chains. Also, make sure its stomach is full when you bring it back.”

 
**Nitocris:**
He gave me those very reasonable terms!
Now, get them!

Tch! Even I can tell... That thing is really powerful!

But don't worry, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet].

It's because I'm a hero. In other words, the good guy always wins!

Now do you get it, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?

**Nitocris:**
And it probably couldn't adapt to the environment either! How foolish of me!

 

 
**Elisabeth:**
Now we finally meet!

 
**Nitocris:**
So you made it through all my challenges, and now here you are at last.

 
**Nitocris:**
I shall praise you for that!
But this is the end of the line!

 
**Nitocris:**
Why? Because I'm splendidly strong! I've been cooped up in my room perfecting my magecraft!

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Unbelievable. She's bragging about being a shut-in!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Wait, are you okay?
I really hate dark and cramped places.

 
**Nitocris:**
Me too! But this is the underworld right now! If I want to enhance my dark pharaoh power, this is the only place!

 
**Nitocris:**
To be honest, the Western underworld is just too damaging.

 
**Nitocris:**
The Egyptian underworld is vast, comfortable, and dry... Why do you people view death as a negative thing?

 
**Nitocris:**
Rather, why do you have to punish souls who have already lost their bodies? Does your god actually hate humans?

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Listen to you. You're pretty cynical. You look pretty sporty, but you're actually just another bookworm.

 
**Nitocris:**
Book...worm? No, I study curses, see...

 
**Nitocris:**
I wrote messages as a pharaoh, but most of what I wrote were spells and curses...

 
**Elisabeth:**
So you're a bass player!

 
**Elisabeth:**
The person that works hard to set the tone of the band from behind the scenes and carve an oppressive sound into the audience!

 
**Elisabeth:**
But the sound is usually hidden under the melody of the guitar. The guitar plays the melody, the bass lays down the rhythm...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, it's so sad! The bassist is lonely,
but their job is the most rock n' roll of them all!
That's what I think!

 
**Elisabeth:**
You must've endured a lot, despite your demeanor!

 
**Nitocris:**
I don't really know what you mean by bassist, but I appreciate your noticing that!

 
**Nitocris:**
And I can see you struggle a lot, too! Just look at how hard the people around you struggle!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes, of course!
Wait... Was that a compliment?

Yeah. She has the insight to understand a situation in a single moment, but her conclusions always seem to miss the mark...

I accept it. That woman is a tough foe! That's why I won't use any tricks. I'll fight her head-on!

Haha, bring it on.

You're not so bad yourself. Those were some amazing moves... Also, those phantoms are cute.

Especially the ones with the sheets on their heads.
The ones that go in circles.

I feel like they could give me some useful ideas for my concert!

**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Argh! You're all a bunch of imbeciles!
Don't you know who I am!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm the leader of the oni, as well as a skilled thief notorious in the capital!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I am Ibaraki-Douji, a thief so great that I was able to build the great Ibuki Shuten Palace on Mt. Ooe!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A thief... Right, I suppose that's accurate... There are records of you stealing treasures from the nobility...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hahahaha, that's right!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
“Princess Kaguya” is such a joke! If I had been around in that period, those five treasures would've easily been mine!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
So, do you fear me now!? Do you respect me!?
Will you praise me!? Will you give me some sweets!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I am an evil monster, an oni...
Ah-choo!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Sniff... It's cold... I hate being cold...
Mother always told me to wear a belly warmer...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Um, wait.
Uh, where was I in my story?

I think we've heard enough.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Enough, eh? I see, I see. Then you're quick to understand. That's not a bad thing.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But Mash. You look as cold as me. Aren't you uncomfortable? Do you not have a belly warmer?

 
**Mash:**
No, I'm fine...
But it's true that the temperature is low in this area.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, as long as you're in your Chaldea uniform, you should be fine. It's resistant to both the cold and the heat.

 
**Mash:**
What about you, Elisabeth? Um, since you're exposing yourself more than usual...

 
**Elisabeth:**

I-I'm a hero, so it shouldn't be a problem!
Heroes don't catch colds!

 
**Mash:**
I don't think she's okay...
Let's get through here as quick as we can.

 
**Nitocris:**
Y-Yes, good idea...

 
**Nitocris:**
From a pharaoh point of view, I think it's best we just run right through.

 
**Nitocris:**
My garments don't cover much either!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Got it. Then let's go for a little run!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Waaah, it's cold!

 
**Nitocris:**
My lovely phantoms normally cool me down, but in this weather, they're kind of annoying!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah... Even I'm cold. And I'm one of the more properly dressed ones.

 
**Mash:**
By the way, Ibaraki!
Why did you come here!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
(Talking with mouth full of something)
Oh, no special reason. I just felt like it.

 
**Mash:**
...Oh. You just felt like it...

 
**Mash:**
And it's not for extremely selfish reasons, correct?

Treat?
 

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I don't understand. Is that a password?
But that tart thing was delicious.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And this “candy” stuff is exceptional as well!
But it's so sweet, I'm afraid my fangs will melt!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Sheesh. Back in the day, a single piece of konpeitou was enough to make me swing between joy and sorrow...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I wish Mother were here, because then I could give her some... But anyway, mmm, I'm very curious about those pound cake things too...

 
**Mash:**
You've developed quite the sweet tooth...

 
**Mash:**
No wonder Shuten treats you like a child...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What are you talking about?
This is not my intention!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Humans are the ones who offer me sweets to save their lives!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Meat is a better choice than sweets when you get hungry. Then again, after becoming a Servant, I am never hungry!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
So I'll let them live in exchange for this unsubstantial offering of sweets, but just this once. Welp, I feel like I'm going to melt!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. Intentions aside, your true feelings are totally showing.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But once you step out of town, what the heck is going on!? Treat! Treat! Treeeaaat!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I keep yelling the password, but no one shows up!
Ah! Oh no! I'm getting sugar withdrawal symptoms...!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I need something to munch on! Something sugary! Something tough!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But if you don't have anything like that, one of those Evil Bones you always have stocked up will do!

Hahaha. That's because we used a lot on Caster Elisabeth.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What...did you just say!?

 

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
So... no more sweets? All gone?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But I still haven't had my favorite&ndash;this thing you call “chocolate”!

 
**Mash:**
That's the way the cookie crumbles...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Grrr, grrr, hahahaha!
...I'm going home...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm going back to the mountain!

 
**Mash:**
P-Please, wait, Ibaraki! I'll give you sweets when we get back to Chaldea!

 
**Mash:**
Our meeting up here must be fate.
Please, won't you help us?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwahahaha!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Nonsense. A human seeking help from an oni is the height of absurdity!

 
**Mash:**
You're right, but...

 
**Robin Hood:**
... (Rustle, rustle)

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
In the first place, I only came here for fun. I am what you could call a visitor from out of town, and yet you ask for my help to&ndash;Mmmpph!

 
**Mash:**
Hmm?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
Ohhh... Ooooooohhh!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Whoops, silly me, throwing chocolate around like that!
I was saving that for the kids in town...

 
**Robin Hood:**
Although I suppose this works in a Japanese sense. Don't people there yell “Oni out, luck in!” while throwing food?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
This is... choco... chocolate...!
It's sweet as hell... and sweet as hell to boot!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This oni here isn't good at expressing herself.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But it won't work. Just a measly piece of chocolate won't work on me at all! It won't work...!

 
**Nitocris:**
She's gritting her teeth through a torrent of tears...
Her lament is making me choke up...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Yaaa! What's wrong, good man in green!? Aren't you going to attack me more!? Come on, come on!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Like the time at Rashomon!
Just like at Rashomon!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Well, I wish I could give you more, but...

 
**Robin Hood:**
Uh-oh, something's coming.
This is no time to be throwing chocolate around.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
Hahahahaha, this infuriates me even more! Scum!
Get out of here. I'll rip you from limb to limb!

 
**Mash:**
M-Moving to battle formation!
Whenever you're ready, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Green man! Green good tidings, green pilgrim, green hermit, green geezer!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
As you can see, the pests are gone! So come on!
Pretend it's Setsubun and throw me some sweets!

 
**Robin Hood:**
All right, all right. I suppose you deserve it. But call me a geezer again and you can kiss chocolate goodbye.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Mmm. Understood. I'm clever in that area.
But... Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We got rid of those enemies as quickly as the chocolates melting in my mouth.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Even this delicious chocolate isn't enough to keep me here. This place isn't worthy anymore! You heard me!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Farewell! Farewell!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh really? I was going to say... If you can defeat the queen living in that pyramid, you'll have all the sweets you can eat. Too bad.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I knew that pyramid was trouble.
When do we leave?

**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. She's an unexpected addition to our party, but Ibaraki-Douji's strength is the real deal. Besides...

 
**Mash:**
Besides what, Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think it's a good thing she's showing an interest in human culture.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if her underlying aggression towards humans can't be changed, having a favorite food in common with us is a positive thing.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, certainly. I think that leads to mutual understanding.

Yeah. So, Fujimaru, I know it'll be tough, but please look after her.

I'm fine here. Use the space to protect your weak bodies instead.

Argh, this... Move over a little, Nitocris!

No way! If my body pokes out any more, my thigh will... My thigh will...!

This is bad. Hey, we've got some enemies.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Enemies? There are enemies here...?

 
**Elisabeth:**
What's that queen thinking!? Here! In the Lava Zone! Why!? Why would she put enemies here!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
This is the only path that leads to the pyramid!
Why is there lava here anyway!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Do they use this path themselves to get to town!?
Are they stupid? Are they morons!?

Nothing like that can be found here!

It's okay, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]. With the five of us, it won't matter who we're facing.

Y-Yes! Everyone, let's hurry!!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
They're not even oni! How can they jump into boiling lava and still survive!?

 
**Mash:**
It's probably the power of love!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Love? Love is scary!

 
## Section 7: "One More Chance"
 
**Elisabeth:**
We've finally made it here...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Come on, everyone, let's take out that witch in her pyramid!

We'll do our best.
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's what the nobility say when they don't actually want to do something!

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm seeing something ahead that looks like a Servant, so be careful.

 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm not scared, no matter who it is!

 
**Elisabeth:**
The journey of the Heroic Idol Elly won't end until I defeat that queen!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Now everybody, charge!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You've got fighting spirit, but not much else... I'm tired.
I can't go full power all day like Shuten.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Green man, give me some caloric fuel.
I want another chocolate.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Right, right. Take that, oni.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Fwahaha! Your pitiful attacks cannot harm me!
I am invincible! (Chomp chomp)

 
**Nitocris:**
Anyway, I'm feeling dirty from all this running around.

 
**Nitocris:**
Fujimaru, you're a Master, can't you conjure up a bathing area or two with your magecraft?

 
**Mash:**
I don't think that's possible...
Oh, I do have towels, though.

 
**Nitocris:**
Alright, I'll take one.
...Hmm. It's a little rough to the touch.

 
**Nitocris:**
Hand me an Egyptian silk one instead.
What? You don't have any?

 
**Nitocris:**
Very well. Prepare one in the castle as soon as this battle is over.

 
**Nitocris:**
Of course, a place to bathe as well.

 
**Mash:**
R-Right...

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
YOU GUYS AREN'T TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AT ALL!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Come on, guys! Can't you get a little more excited?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Come on, shout in unison with me, the hero!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Sure. After we win.

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
ARGH! Fine! Forget it!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Come on, who's our next opponent!?
Someone else from the Round Table? Bring it!

 
**???:**
...Oh?

 
**Elisabeth:**
U-Uncle...!?

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Uncle... Vlad III!?

 
**Mash:**
Huh? But he seems a little different than the person I know...

 
**Vlad III:**
Of course I am.

 
**Vlad III:**
A Servant is summoned by extracting a single aspect of a hero.

 
**Vlad III:**
I am not here as King Vlad III.
I am here as the warrior who punishes all evil.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Um, Uncle Vlad? ...Why are you glaring at me...
Is something the matter?

 
**Vlad III:**
Elisabeth Báthory!
I have come to judge you for your sins!

 
**Elisabeth:**
H-Huh!? You have!?

 
**Vlad III:**
Save your breath!

 
**Vlad III:**
Your existence is sinful... And now you shall be punished for your immorality and wickedness!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Jeez... Count Vlad normally only gets mad when people call him a vampire, but look at him now!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, never mind. This is the warrior Vlad&ndash;no wonder his anger threshold is so low!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-Anyway, prepare for combat!

 
**Mash:**
Elisabeth! Let's just fight for now!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Um, okay... Y-Yeah, you're right! We have to fight...!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Got him... No! We didn't!
Master, we're continuing the battle!

 
**Vlad III:**
&mdash;No, we're done.
As I thought, thou does not understand.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh...?

 
**Vlad III:**
...Start over from the beginning once more. Otherwise, thou shall never be able to stand before that Queen.

 
**Vlad III:**
If thy wish to call thyself a hero and wear that armor, thy must first understand!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Understand what&mdash;Huh?

 
**???:**
...y.

 
**???:**
...ry.

 
**???:**
...rry.

 
**???:**
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry this is so sudden...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh!?

 
**Mash:**
Um... Uh...What!?

 
**???:**
I'm really sorry, but...

 
**???:**
I regret to make you do this after all the battles you've fought, but&mdash;

 
**???:**
I want you to start over from the graveyard.

 
**???:**
&mdash;Ahem.

 
**???:**
This isn't some kind of system issue.
There's a reason for it...

 
**???:**
Fujimaru, I want you to consider as a trial...

 
**???:**
Alright&mdash; I'm sorry, but I'm going to teleport you.

 
**All:**
 
WHY!?

 
## Section 8: "New Game Plus"
 
**Elisabeth:**
...We've come back...

 
**Mash:**
Ignoring the fact that there's a giant Siegfried floating in the night sky...

 
**Mash:**
What could it be that Elisabeth doesn't understand?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Green man, you seem to have some idea.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Huh?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Haha. Don't play dumb.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You were the only one who had a knowing look on your face.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, yeah... Probably.

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? What is it!? What don't I understand?

 
**Robin Hood:**
...Didn't you notice something about the town?

 
**Elisabeth:**
The town...? Hmm... Oh, now that you mention it...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Nobody was preparing for Halloween.
Everyone was locked up in their houses.

 
**Mash:**
Isn't that because the queen in that pyramid banned all the festivities?

 
**Robin Hood:**
No.

 
**Robin Hood:**
The lack of activity was apparent long before she even came.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Huh?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Let me fill you in.

 
**Robin Hood:**
You were so busy getting excited for Halloween that you left all your administrative duties in the lurch!

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Oh.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Don't “Oh” me!

 
**Robin Hood:**
And because you were doing nothing as leader, the townspeople didn't know if it was okay to get ready for the festival or not!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Neither did your soldiers! They couldn't decide whether to go forward with the preparations or whether to stop them!

 
**Robin Hood:**
You were the only one who was getting excited for Halloween, basically!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Ahhhh...ahh...ahhhhh!

 
**Nitocris:**
Th-That's really bad...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...That's... So that's it...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
So you alone got so swept up in Halloween fever that you forgot to order preparations to begin?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm in shock. How can you be a ruler if you don't care for your people?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
A ruler must first ensure that their subordinates' bellies are full. Only then can the ruler eat. (Chomp chomp)

 
**Elisabeth:**
B-But I was really busy preparing for the concert...

 
**Mash:**
...There's really no excuse for what you've done...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Ugh... Wh-What should I do, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?
Uncle Vlad was really mad!

**Elisabeth:**
Waaaahh...

 
**Mash:**
Elisabeth, I understand how you feel, but...

 
**Mash:**
We need to go back towards that gate to see the queen anyway...

 
**Elisabeth:**
But Uncle Vlad's going to get mad again...

 
**Nitocris:**
We can't do anything about that.
But there's one way to apologize...

 
**Nitocris:**
You need to make the festival a success.

Let's make it the best Halloween ever.
 
**Elisabeth:**
The best ever...? But how?

 
**Robin Hood:**
...Well, all you have to do is tell the townspeople that Halloween's begun.

 

 
**Mash:**
That's right, Elisabeth!
Let's start Halloween properly!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Y-You're right!
But how...?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Hand out pumpkins, throw sweets, and have the little brats get their costumes ready.

 
**Robin Hood:**
And then get rid of the wandering ghosts drawn to the festivities.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...G-Got it!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Humph. Then make the announcement.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Make the announcement. Tell everyone that the festival you promised them, the one with overflowing sweets, is set to begin.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
As a leader, you must be capable of such a proclamation. Especially given how loud you are usually.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...You're right. I can't just lip-synch along with some recording through a mic. My pride won't allow it.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Here I go!

 
**Elisabeth:**
This is Elisabeth Báthory, the ruler of Castle Csejte!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm sorry I'm laaaaaate!
But I have an announcement!

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Let the Halloween festivities commence!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Be careful! Elisabeth's proclamation made the dead burst from the ground!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Haha! As I expected, your words made the dead scream in terror!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It's time for this Halloween thing to begin!
Come, Master!

 
**Nitocris:**
I'm seeing lots of pumpkinheads!
Let's smash them all!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Master!
I'll do my best!

 
**Elisabeth:**
This time, I will do Halloween right!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We got a lot of pumpkins...

 
**Nitocris:**
Let's give them to the people.
This should get Halloween off to a good start.

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right. You gotta start with a strong opening act!

 
## Section 9: "Halloween Declaration"
 
**Mash:**
The townspeople still aren't celebrating Halloween.
I'm not sure, but they don't seem very happy.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Then let's start by making the place Halloween central! Right, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?

...Once I decide something, shouldn't it just kind of happen?

 
**Robin Hood:**
No, it shouldn't! Do you think you're some kind of spoiled princess?

We can't do it alone. Let's ask the townspeople for help.

**Robin Hood:**
Yeah. I'm with you.

 
**Robin Hood:**
We won't get anywhere unless we ask the townspeople.

 

 
**Elisabeth:**
...R-Right! Time to order the pigs around!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Nobody likes being called a pig. Explain to them what's going on properly. Come on, you're the ruler.

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? But my fans love it!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Even that Cock Robin chirped with joy! As its owner, that means you'd love it if I called you a pig too, right?

 
**Robin Hood:**
I've got nothing to do with that fat thing!
It just follows me everywhere!

 
**Nitocris:**
Elisabeth, you mustn't assume all humans are the same.

 
**Nitocris:**
If you want to make Halloween fun, then you must ask properly.

 
**Elisabeth:**
F-Fine...

 
**Robin Hood:**
Okay, let's split up and ask everyone we come across.

 
**Robin Hood:**
We can hand out the pumpkins at the same time.

 
**Nitocris:**
You're right. Let's reconvene here in two hours.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Okay, see you then!

Huh? Wait, where do I go?

Okay!

Alright, I'll sit this one out.
I'll be waiting here! (Chomp chomp)

Looks like we're all here.

 
**Mash:**
We didn't have any luck...
Master, this is depressing...

 
**Nitocris:**
You too? ...Robin Hood, what about you?

 
**Robin Hood:**
No good. Zilch.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Still, people did seem to be looking forward to the festivities.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, yes. I agree.

 
**Mash:**
I don't think they were against Halloween per se, but they were not particularly open about any support either.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Grrr... Unforgivable! Halloween's a festival kids and adults can both enjoy, and yet...

 
**Nitocris:**
It seems that Elisabeth does not have enough respect as a ruler.

 
**Nitocris:**
Add that to the fact that the queen in the pyramid banned Halloween and it's no wonder they're not on board.

 
**Nitocris:**
...Sheesh. What kind of queen would do that to a pyramid, anyway?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, what is it about me that's wrong?

 
**H：All:**
The outfit (probably).

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
BUT I AM A HERO!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
Halloween has been banned by&mdash;
Oh, not you people again!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, I know! Hey, you there!

 
**Elisabeth:**
What do you think when you look at me?

 
**Queen's Knight:**
What do I think?

 
**Queen's Knight:**
You should hold back on showing your skin.
It'll hurt if you get slashed.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Zero fashion sense!

 
**Mash:**
...That sound... Oh no!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hmm? More commotion?
Well, it has nothing to do with me.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I've got this chocolate cake that the townspeople gave me to consume instead!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Heh, heheheh... It feels like a waste to even eat it... Where should my first bite be?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Gee... It looks good no matter where you begin...
Aww... Heheh. You adorable little thing...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I think I should take little nibbles from the side and&mdash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
HEY! WHAT GIVES!?

 
**Mash:**
You're...!

 
**???:**
Oh, how sad...

 
**???:**
It saddens me that the queen does not wish to see the town stained in the orange of Halloween...

 
**Robin Hood:**
Huh? What's with this pretty boy?

 
**Tristan:**
I am Tristan... Former Knight of the Round Table. Currently a Queen's Knight.

 
**Tristan:**
Call me Tristan the Tragic... Or perhaps Tristan Who Sighs And Looks Out Upon the Setting Sun...

 
**Robin Hood:**

You're an Archer. You needn't go out ahead&mdash;

Wait! Where are you&mdash;

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!

New enemy approaching, for sure this time!

 
**Tristan:**
What's wrong, Lanc&mdash;

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
SHUUUTTTTTT UPPPPPPPP!!!

 
**Tristan:**
Eh...!? Why the sudden sleeper hold!?

 
**Tristan:**
I give up! I give up! I give up!
I'm tapping out! I'm tapping out!

 
**Mash:**
They've started fighting each other!
Master, let's take them out now!

 
**Mash:**
...Um, I don't really understand why...

Anyway! This town is going to celebrate Halloween!
I won't allow any complaints!

 
**Elisabeth:**
That goes for you guys too.
Here, wear these and go celebrate!

 
**Queen's Knight:**
A jack-o'-lantern? Uh, wait, let me at least remove my helm&mdash;

 
**Elisabeth:**
Save it.

 
**Nitocris:**
Those knights ran away crying...

 
**Robin Hood:**
Probably because you cursed those pumpkins with your Egyptian magecraft or what have you. They'll never come off now.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Thank you, Nitocris!

 
**Nitocris:**
...Well, it is Halloween after all.
Anyway, Elisabeth.

 
**Nitocris:**
Now the townspeople can prepare for the festivities without having to be afraid of the queen.

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's true!
Okay, everyone! We drove all the knights away!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Feel safe to openly celebrate Halloween!

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
GOOOOOOOOOD...

 
**Tristan:**
You seem quite happy, considering we lost...

 
**Tristan:**
Still, I'm glad too.

 
**Tristan:**
She matures fast... I was so sure it would've taken at least ten years...

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
QUEEEEEEEEEEEN!

 
**Tristan:**
Yes. Now she has won the right to face the queen.

 
**Tristan:**
Now it's a question of whether or not she can surpass her. This is something we must see with our own eyes.

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
ESCAAAAAAAAAAAPE!

 
**Tristan:**
Yes, let's take flight. Quietly now.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, they're fleeing!

 
**Tristan:**
Easy.

 
**Nitocris:**
How rude...!

 
**Nitocris:**
The vanquished should hang their heads and await punishment!

 
**Nitocris:**
Surround them, Medjed!

 
**Tristan:**
How sad... But naturally, a knight never gives up!
Not until he draws his last breath!

 
**Tristan:**
The game is not over until the whistle blows...!

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
WINNERRRRRRRRRRR!

 
**Tristan:**
Now, let us escape!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...So, it was you.

 
**Tristan:**
Step aside, young one. You're clearly not one of us.

 
**Tristan:**
As you can see, I am the embodiment of chivalrous ideals, dreams, and realities. I would never lay a hand on a woman.

 
**Tristan:**
That holds true even for non-humans like you. In fact, if you were a decade or so older, I would have liked to have dinner with you.

 
**Tristan:**
...However, given the murderous look on your face, I shall use an Evade skill on myself. Just to be safe.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That wind-cutting bow of yours...
So you're the scumbag responsible!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
“Great Grudge of Rashomon”!

 
**Tristan:**
Oh my...! A Noble Phantasm that removes buffs...
How awful!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Here's another one for you!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Go, Sogen-bi! You're going to pay for what you did to my cake!

“Great Grudge of Rashomon”! Raaarrrrgh!

 
**Tristan:**
Two in a row! How... agile...

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
STUUUUUPIIIIIIIID!!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm, not good. I should have sent them flying the opposite way.

 
**Nitocris:**
They went flying towards the pyramid.

Th-Things like that happen in battle, you know.

Halloween sure is fun.
 
**Robin Hood:**
Well, people need to take breaks at times. Although as a person coming from the forest, I hate rowdy places.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You say that, but I know you're secretly handing out candy to the kids.

 
**Robin Hood:**
What!? But I never sensed your eyes on me!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Kahahaha, I disguised myself as a child and received some too!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Have you no shame...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Humph, call me clever, you spineless candyman.
I just have a different sense of pride, that is all.

 

 
**Elisabeth:**
Now let's go pay the queen a visit! My concert will&mdash;No, never mind. The concert is also important, but...

 
**Elisabeth:**
But most of all, in order for everyone to enjoy Halloween, we need to take her out!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
I kind of understand what you're trying to say, Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Even as a Heroic Spirit stopped in time, one can still understand and learn something new.

 
**Nitocris:**
...That is true.

 
**Nitocris:**
Even if it is like a single night's dream, the experience will not have been in vain.

 
**Nitocris:**
Mash Kyrielight.

 
**Mash:**
Yes?

 
**Nitocris:**
...I'm sorry, it's nothing. It doesn't seem like you need my words of advice.

 
**Mash:**
H-Huh...?

 
**Nitocris:**
Now, let us go. And let us face that gatekeeper once more.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...By the way, maybe one song wouldn't hurt before we go...?

 
**H：All:**
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

 
## Section 10: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 1"
 
**Elisabeth:**
There's another pumpkin here!
It's harvesting time!

 
**Mash:**
Can you really call it harvesting if it's just taking pumpkins off their heads?

 
## Section 11: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 2"
 
**Nitocris:**
There's even pumpkins in my cave...!
Let's slay them right away.

 
**Nitocris:**
My apologies, Elisabeth, but this cave does not need any Halloween decorations!

 
**Nitocris:**
The reason is... Yes, the reason is...

 
**Nitocris:**
...jack-o'-lanterns have too much overlap with the Medjed design!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
All right, that'll do for today.
We'll harvest more pumpkins tomorrow!

 
## Section 12: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 3"
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's freezing, so run through as fast you can!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Right. I love the feeling of a cold piece of chocolate melting in my mouth, but it's so cold my teeth will break over it!

 
## Section 13: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 4"
 
**Mash:**
...It seems those three aren't here.

Let's hurry!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
R-Right. I don't know what they'll do now that they figured out they were tricked, and I don't want to know!

 
## Section 14: "Let's Sing a Song"
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Um, uh...
Trick or treat, Uncle Vlad!

 
**Vlad III:**
I can hear the festival... Did you yourself realize why I was angry, or did someone bring it to your attention?

 
**Vlad III:**
If the former, then you show some promise.

 
**Vlad III:**
If the latter, then they showed you sympathy.

 
**Vlad III:**
The verdict looks only at the results. If the people were satisfied, then you have the right to proceed.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Uncle Vlad!

 
**Vlad III:**
However, in this form I am especially strict with you.

 
**Vlad III:**
You have committed many sins...

 
**Vlad III:**
One of which I, having become a Heroic Spirit, simply cannot ignore.

 
**Vlad III:**
...I won't say to atone for it with death.
For there is no way to atone.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...!

 
**Vlad III:**
As a king, I demonstrate magnanimity while I suffer within. But as a warrior, I shall never show mercy toward wickedness.

 
**Vlad III:**
You... Evil killer who committed depraved acts, toyed with the citizens, and thought it only natural to be ignorant...

 
**Vlad III:**
Your sins are a nightmare from which no one can wake, even after 100 years. What you have done is committed a crime engraved in history.

 
**Vlad III:**
It is time you return to the darkness where no one can venture. I shall slaughter every last one of you.

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Vlad III:**
...I would have never thought my skill with a lance would come up short against a fictional creature&ndash;a vampire.

 
**Vlad III:**
I must be the one who is unworthy.

 
**Elisabeth:**
U-Um... Uncle Vlad?

 
**Vlad III:**
You have no right to call me that. You should refer to me as “uncle” when I'm summoned as king.

 
**Vlad III:**
I told you before. Each different aspect of a particular hero manifests as its own distinct Servant.

 
**Vlad III:**
Like what has happened with me here, now.

 
**Elisabeth:**
But, but even so... you're still Uncle Vlad.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Even though you may hate me.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Even though I may have done things that are unforgivable.

 
**Vlad III:**
You have indeed. You committed a sin... though the world may not consider it that way.

 
**Vlad III:**
That sin is not even engraved upon your Spirit Origin. After all, that world has been forgotten.

 
**Vlad III:**
...But I shall never forget.

 
**Vlad III:**
You denied the final integrity of my light, my wife, my love.

 
**Vlad III:**
For her sake, I will not forgive you.
Even if she herself may have...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Elisabeth...

 
**Robin Hood:**
...I see. I somewhat recall it too.
Man, humanity being in a state of flux is a nuisance.

 
**Robin Hood:**
That Vlad III and Elisabeth had a bit of a history together.

 
**Robin Hood:**
This isn't about who's right and who's wrong.

 
**Robin Hood:**
The World isn't concerned by human values like virtue. It will just adopt whatever means are useful to guarantee the continuation of its existence.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Whether it's a young lady who tries to atone for her grave sins, even if she knows no shame...

 
**Robin Hood:**
...or the conviction of a gentleman who won't accept any kind of atonement, but just seeks to punish every evil act... The World considers them equally sinful.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Right. They're the same, so it will choose the one that's more effective&ndash;even someone evil, if it means preserving humanity.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If humanity's preservation isn't wished for, they won't be allowed to be summoned as a Heroic Spirit. Even if they stand for righteousness.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But if that's the case, it means even Vlad III wishes for the preservation of humanity.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
After all, he was summoned as a Servant this time.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...I think you're right. I hate humans.
I don't like them and I don't trust them.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That being said, I have no intention of destroying their world. After all, humans are useful for a number of things.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I exist because humans, my enemies, exist. In a world without humans, neither Shuten nor I would be summoned.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Isn't that true, Red Horns?
No matter how many sins you've committed...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No one can reject your being here right now. As long as you don't wish for “nothingness,” you'll be a Heroic Spirit like the rest of us.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Of course, as an Anti-Hero... A sacrifice whose role is to lose to the Heroic Spirits.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...You're right. Thanks, Ibaraki.
I'm grateful.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Now then... Sorry for making you wait, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet].
Come! To the final battle with the queen!

Nice reaction!
Thank you, Fujimaru!

 
**Elisabeth:**
After we take the castle back, I'll let you help me prepare for my concert!

 
**Mash:**
Ah, Master's face suddenly went pale.

I'll follow you anywhere, Elly!
 
**Elisabeth:**
Heh... It makes my heart flutter to be called a pet name by a fan...!

 
**Elisabeth:**
All right, I'll specially reserve a front-row seat for you at my concert!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's wrong!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru is displaying signs of being in an incredibly agitated mental state...!

 

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
Why!?

 
**???:**
Mmmm, don't tell me they really made it!?
Were my countermeasures too flimsy!?

 
**???:**
No, no, calm down. Calm down.
Everyone makes mistakes. I'm no exception.

 
**???:**
Rather, a beautiful queen is the only one allowed to make careless mistakes. Paradoxically, those mistakes are what make her a queen in the first place!

 
**???:**
Yes, that's right. That proves I'm not at fault here. Therefore...

 
**???:**
Rise, you useless loser knights!
Next up is an all-out war.

 
**???:**
The time has come to make it clear who's best suited to rule this land!

 
**???:**
I too... have a wish, and to make it come true, I shall continue being the queen!

 
**???:**
That is the agreement I made with that person!

 
## Section 15: "Trick or Treat!"
 
**Tristan:**
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, it's the knights that ran away.

 
**Tristan:**
That depends on how you look at it.
Things must be observed from up high...

 
**Tristan:**
This is called a “bird's-eye view.” It looked like I was about to lose, so I, Tristan the Sad, threw the match.

 
**Tristan:**
In other words, by giving up on winning, I avoided defeat. I am a quick-witted man almost to the point of sadness...

 
**Mash:**
That is certainly sad, in every sense of the word...

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
FWWWWUUUUUUUUUU...

 
**Mash:**
Master, I have a strange feeling about that black knight. Trying to whistle but not quite getting it and whatnot.

 
**Mash:**
We should focus on taking them out right here...
Or perhaps we could just have a nice, long chat...

I'm fine. I'm calm right now! Now, let's fight!

 

 
**Tristan:**
(Oh, how terrible... That seemingly gentle girl has the menacing look of an executioner.)

 
**Tristan:**
(What did you do to make her hate you so much?)

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
(I'm sorry... But I don't remember. I think it's some sort of misunderstanding. She'll calm down soon enough.)

 
**Tristan:**
(Really...? So it's not dangerous?
As in something that would end up involving me?)

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
(N-No, it's nothing, probably.)

 
**Tristan:**
Good to know. Ahem.
Her Majesty awaits. This way, please.

 
**Elisabeth:**
We finally get to see her...
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], get psyched.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Don't get fooled by her unorthodox attitude and appearance.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Inside there's a nastiness boiling up like a poisonous stew!

 
**Nitocris:**
Do you know her True Name?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Nope, not at all!

 
**Nitocris:**
...Well, given that there's a pyramid, it must be someone who has something to do with me.

 
**Nitocris:**
...Let me double-check. She really is a queen, right?

 
**Nitocris:**
Because I'll be forced to surrender if it turns out to be some extravagant man with eyes like the sun and a beautiful voice...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Don't worry. She's a woman for sure.
Just her true nature is different.

 
**Elisabeth:**
I may be a dragon, but she's a snake&ndash;a fiercely venomous one at that!

 
**C：???:**
I see you haven't learned anything from your two defeats. How dare you come here, you little lizard!

 
**C：???:**
I fail to understand how you are so pathetic, but I shall praise you for surviving this hell twice!

 
**C：???:**
But you are still merely a girl crazy about Halloween! To someone tempered by the hot desert sand like myself, you&mdash;

 
**C：???:**
...Am I seeing things? Is there one less of you? ...Wait. You look stronger than before!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Heh, for you to notice that...
That's some observation you got there.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes, I was born once more through a Palingenesis-like process from the humiliation of having everything taken from me, and my own self-denial...

 
**Elisabeth:**
I am the muscle-based idol that has become a Saber-class Servant, Elisabeth Báthory (Brave)!

That's right. Everyone just kept quiet.

Indeed. A beauty so great you would lose your words. That is I!

 
**C：???:**
If you understand, then bow to the ground until you bang your head! I'll also allow you to take photos of me, this time only!

 

 
**Tristan:**
Bow before Her Majesty. You're not going to listen to me anyway, but...

 
**C：???:**
Don't just tell them without even meaning it, you dumb dodo! You do nothing but fail!

 
**C：???:**
It's your own incompetence that has allowed them to come this far! As punishment, do a handstand over there!

 
**C：???:**
But don't stop playing the harp!

 
**Tristan:**
So sad... So backbreaking. But if Her Majesty commands it, I must obey.

 
**Elisabeth:**
You can actually do it!?

 
**C：???:**
Also...

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
...

 
**C：???:**
It seems that the current situation is punishment enough for Sir Anonymous here. Very well, I will let him off the hook.

 
**Mash:**
No, I think it's only fair that he gets punished too. Specifically, he has to take off his helmet or show us his face.

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
...!!!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Umm... Mash...?
You're acting kinda scary...

 
**Mash:**
R-Really?

 
**Mash:**
Sorry... When I look at that indecisive black knight, my heart becomes as jagged as a Saint Quartz...

 
**C：???:**
So you get irritated. That was a nice way to put it.

 
**C：???:**
I completely understand how you feel, but have your fight elsewhere.

 
**C：???:**
It's a drag, but first I have my duty as a ruler.

 
**C：???:**
Elisabeth Báthory, the fact that you've made it here means you finally understand, yes?

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Yes.

 
**Elisabeth:**
I got too excited over the Halloween concert and neglected my duties as ruler.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...I was too immature to rule over the common pigs.

 
**C：???:**
Yes, it is pure stupidity for those who stand on top to seek something other than being at the top!

 
**C：???:**
To be served you need a reason to be served.
Or you need fervor!

 
**C：???:**
That reason may be that you're as beautiful as the heavens. It could be that you wield power, even though you're hideous.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, that stings... I'm as beautiful as the heavens, but I chose the life of an idol...

 
**C：???:**
No, I'm the beautiful one.
You're the powerful one.

 
**C：???:**
You said it yourself just a second ago. You're the muscle-based idol, Lowland Gorilla Báthory.

 
**Elisabeth:**
I didn't say that! Only the Báthory part is right!

 
**C：???:**
Now that you mention it, you're right, but who cares about the small things! We're having an important discussion right now!

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's my line! I've never had so much trouble talking to someone before!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Just who are you?!

 
**Elisabeth:**
You act like some sort of model, but what Heroic Spirit are you?!

 
**C：???:**
Isn't it obvious? A queen who rules with beauty!
Whose name is synonymous with beauty!

 
**C：???:**
If you asked a hundred people who that queen is, they would all tell you my name!

 
**C：???:**
Yes, my name!
My beautiful name is...!

**Cleopatra:**
Ohohohoho. Even a girl with the bare minimum of nobility like you knows my name.

 
**Cleopatra:**
Then I shall ask again.
Can you compete against my beauty?

 
**Elisabeth:**
...This is bad. When it comes to whose Heroic Spirit is more beautiful, she has the upper hand...

No matter how you look at it, my style is more modern, but I can't beat her brand reputation...

What, are you saying my bikini armor is old-school!?
It's totally modern! Right!?

 
**Nitocris:**
Yes, I think that outfit is good. It would make perfect sense in Ancient Egypt.

 
**Elisabeth:**
I know, right? Finally somebody from Egypt gets me!

 
**Robin Hood:**
To me you both look the sa&mdash;No, never mind.

 
**Robin Hood:**
But, well, in terms of looking dignified, the queen over there is on a different level. Her self-confidence has no limits.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I don't know what to say. My standards of beauty are different from humans' to begin with.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That being said... Hahahahaha!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Master! Master! She has an ulterior motive, and a malicious one at that.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Like she'll bite you or tear you up if you get close.
Well, I guess for a demon, that's pretty beautiful!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Hmm... You're not human, huh?
Then it makes sense you can't understand me.

 
**Cleopatra:**
And also...

 
**Nitocris:**
...

 
**Cleopatra:**
You...

 
**Nitocris:**
Quiet, Cleopatra. I simply ended up on this side by chance this time.

 
**Nitocris:**
I am just a normal Caster, a mage. You just need to live up to your beliefs without wavering.

 
**Cleopatra:**
...Yes.

 
**Cleopatra:**
So, Elisabeth, let me ask you again.
Do you intend to compete with my beauty?

 
**Cleopatra:**
Ha...hahahaha! Ohohoho! No way, that would be impossible! That's not even a contest!

 
**Cleopatra:**
If you're a woman, then you know there's nothing more terrifying than being judged based on your beauty!

 
**Cleopatra:**
I am the world-renowned Cleopatra!
That contest would only make you lose face...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? I can compete.

 
**Cleopatra:**
...What was that?

 
**Elisabeth:**
It's true that if we're just talking how our bodies look, my physical age might put me at a very slight disadvantage...

 
**Elisabeth:**
In any event, diversification is in right now. There are more standards of beauty now than there were in the past. Espeeeeecially...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes! What about cuteness?
I sing, dance, and smile for my pig fans!

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's something only an idol like me can do! And something a queen, who is served on every day, cannot!

 
**Cleopatra:**
In other words, you're not someone that rules over others...

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right! Your Majesty, I challenge you to a duel!
As an idol!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, and of course I'll take up the reins of government. An idol can rule just fine.

 
**Cleopatra:**
How dare you... How dare you...
You have no idea how mad your proposal makes me...!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Beauty is born from intelligence.
Thus, ruling is carried out through beauty...!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Ruling over the masses merely because you're “cute”...
As a queen, I won't allow such happy-go-lucky attitudes!

 
**Mash:**
(I kind of get why Cleopatra is mad...)

 
**Robin Hood:**
(No, Elisabeth is just that selfish. After all, she's an Anti-Hero...someone who's been making mistakes her whole life.)

 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm an idol, and the mistress of Castle Csejte!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Servants get summoned as Lancers, Casters, and so on, right?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Just like Uncle Vlad accepted me for who I am and didn't forgive me&mdash;

 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm greedy, prideful, and selfish.
That's why both versions of me are important!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I won't give up on either one!

 
**Cleopatra:**
So you're not going to give up...on either of you?
This is why regional rulers are so annoying...!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Very well, we'll see just how long you can keep that attitude. I'll test you!

 
**Cleopatra:**
...At the end of the day, you're just spouting nonsense! Drown in the beauty of Cleopatra...and die!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Tristan:**
...Splendid. This is different than before.
A complete defeat...

 
**Tristan:**
Ha... Excellent. Truly excellent.
A splended defeat is quite exhilarating.

 
**Mysterious Black Knight:**
(I'm not sure about that...
I feel like we fought for nothing...!)

 
**Cleopatra:**
...I can't believe it. I didn't think I would lose...

 
**Elisabeth:**
The match is over! You're going to give me back Castle Csejte!

 
**Elisabeth:**
And do something about this pyramid!
Actually, don't bring this kind of stuff in here!

 
**Cleopatra:**
...That's... kind of difficult...

 
**Elisabeth:**
What?

 
**Cleopatra:**
...Well, I'm not the one who brought this pyramid here.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Then who dropped this annoying thing on my castle?!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Well...

 
**G：???:**
IT WAS ME!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Who are you!?

 
**Nitocris:**
Th-That voice...!?

 
**Nitocris:**
It can't be?! It couldn't, could it!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
If you want to know who I am, I shall answer.
I am Ozymandias, the king who rules the sun!!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hahahaha! Cleopatra!
They've completely crushed you!

 
**Cleopatra:**
H-How embarrassing! As someone who holds the name of pharaoh, I have fallen hard...!

 
**Cleopatra:**
I cannot bear any additional embarrassment.
Please sever my head!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I don't want you making a bloody mess here!
We're going to decorate for Halloween!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Yes. Just as that thin girl over there says.
We need to decorate this castle now.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Your blood would ruin the festival. Your punishment will be to sit there and take your shame!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Yes, Your Majesty!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ozymandias... In other words, Ramesses II! To think someone so important would show up in this weird Singularity...!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's like an adult showing up to a kid's event, you know!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Adults have fun, too. Grown-ups enjoy this kind of levity!

 
**Ozymandias:**
But that's why you should not worry.
I will not fight.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Cleopatra was ruling over this pyramid, and was defeated by you.

 
**Nitocris:**
I would have never thought Your Majesty... If you had given me word... I wouldn't have joined their side...

 
**Ozymandias:**
Heh. Don't say that, Nitocris.
I told Cleopatra to keep her mouth shut.

 
**Nitocris:**
I-I'm not displeased at all!
My apologies for slipping my tongue!

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Umm, I'm not really following what you guys are saying. Why are people from Egypt here?

 
**Both:**
HOW DISRESPECTFUL!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Whyaun!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
I can't help it! I don't know if I'm being disrespectful!
I don't know what's going on!

 
**Robin Hood:**
That's right. You guys really have no connection to this place whatsoever, so why are you here?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Umph, No Face King of the Forest.

 
**Ozymandias:**
...Very well. It's no fun just seeing you all rack your brains.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Then I shall ask you. Does anyone know the final moments of this woman, Cleopatra?

 
**Cleopatra:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes.

 
**Mash:**
They say she committed suicide after her husband Antonius, general of the Roman army...

 
**Mash:**
...lost to Augustus in the naval battle of Actium and later died.

 
**Ozymandias:**
That's right. The Ptolemaic Kingdom quickly collapsed and the country disappeared.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Leaving her as the last pharaoh.

 
**Cleopatra:**
...

 
**Ozymandias:**
And thus, she has avoided wishing for anything, and refused to be summoned as a Servant until now.

 
**Mash:**
...What do you mean?

 
**Ozymandias:**
She has a personal desire.

 
**Ozymandias:**
And it's something that won't come true unless she participates in a Holy Grail War as a Servant.

 
**Ozymandias:**
But it's not a wish as a pharaoh. It's a selfish desire you could find anywhere on the streets.

 
**Ozymandias:**
She feels so responsible for the destruction of her country that she has locked it away in her heart.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Thinking that someone that has done what she did should not be allowed to have a wish!

 
**Ozymandias:**
But I don't think it's something to be suffering over for a thousand or so years, so I gave her an opportunity.

 
**Ozymandias:**
To rule this upside-down pyramid as queen...

 
**Ozymandias:**
...Until Halloween ends.

 
**Ozymandias:**
And had she done that, I would have granted her wish with the Holy Grail I was given.

 
**Mash:**
A Holy Grail...!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
And then you lost. You have no objections.
Right, Cleopatra?

 
**Cleopatra:**
...Correct.

 
**Cleopatra:**
I realized that it's wrong for someone like me to hope for something.

 
**Ozymandias:**
I see, and so you're going to suppress that wish and turn your back on it for the rest of eternity, then!?

 
**Cleopatra:**
That is the least I can do to atone for destroying my country.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Nitocris:**
...

 
**Ozymandias:**
...Heh.

 
**Cleopatra:**
?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahaha!!
That's your answer!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Ridiculous! Anubis would be holding his belly laughing, I imagine! Did you hear that, thin girl?!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I told you to call me Elisabeth! Or if you want to be more friendly, Elly is also good!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Huh. I see. In that case, Elly, or whatever, if you have something to say, you should say it now!

 
**Ozymandias:**
I appreciate that ridiculous arrogance of yours!

 
**Mash:**
Did you just say Elly!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Then I'll say it.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Umm... You know, Cleopatra...
You're an...

 
**Elisabeth:**
IDIOT!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Aren't you?

 
**Cleopatra:**
What...!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Didn't I tell you? That I would be both an idol and a ruler!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
You can be a pha... pharaoh? and have a personal desire at the same time!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Take part in a bunch of Holy Grail Wars, and do your best to get it granted!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Why can't you do the things that I can do?

 
**Elisabeth:**
You can do it right? I bet you could do it while you dance gracefully even.

 
**Cleopatra:**
That's...!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I don't want to say this, but...

 
**Elisabeth:**
I got all excited about being an idol, I forgot about Halloween, so you might have ruled a bit... better, maybe.

 
**Elisabeth:**
You can have your own personal desires!

 
**Cleopatra:**
...Are you sure...
I don't know if I can&mdash;

 
**Elisabeth:**
It's fine! You think so too, right [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Humanity's final Master, Fujimaru!
You look like you want to say something.

 
**Ozymandias:**
It's fine! Finish her off!
Don't hold back and tell her!

Selfish...

...You're right.
I've wanted to be, this entire time.

You do you, Cleopatra.
 
**Cleopatra:**
Be...myself...
You're right.

 
**Cleopatra:**
That's what I've been trying to be this whole time, but...

 
**Cleopatra:**
At some point, all I could think about was being a pharaoh...

 

 
**Cleopatra:**
Sun King, Ozymandias.
Incarnation of Horus, Queen Nitocris.

 
**Cleopatra:**
Please forgive me. From this day forth, I will accept myself for who I am, and not just be a pharaoh.

 
**Nitocris:**
I forgive you. Become the strength needed for those that follow you. Act like the name you have carved into history.

 
**Ozymandias:**
I too grant forgiveness. Have the name of Cleopatra shine brightly, arrogantly, and proudly!

 
**Cleopatra:**
...Fujimaru.

 
**Cleopatra:**
My name is Cleopatra VII.
A former pharaoh.

 
**Cleopatra:**
From this day forward, I will answer the summons as a Heroic Spirit and protect human history.

 
**Cleopatra:**
When that happens, I will use this beautiful face, this voice, this body to be an Assassin class Servant.

 
**Cleopatra:**
In other words... My glory is wasted on you.
Give it up and resign yourself to it!

**Cleopatra:**
Th-That was a good answer, Fujimaru! You've been wonderful this far. Now you just need to rest!

 
**Elisabeth:**
All right. Everything's good now!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Mhh. So is everything done here? (Crunch, crunch)

 
**Mash:**
Ibaraki-Douji... Slow down when you eat.
There will be plenty of candy once Halloween begins.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm not eating. I'm not eating any candy.

 
**Elisabeth:**
...So what was that selfish wish, anyway?

 
**Cleopatra:**
Th-That...

 
**Nitocris:**
I've never heard of your wish.
Would you tell us, if you don't mind?

 
**Cleopatra:**
Yes, if that's what you want, Your Majesty.
My wish... Well, I have several, but...

 
**Cleopatra:**
I'd like to see the man I loved one more time. I don't really want to get back together with him, but...

 
**Cleopatra:**
I still remember...

 
**Cleopatra:**
The day he whispered sweet nothings into my ear while holding me in his slender but strong arms...

 
**Cleopatra:**
His chiseled features, his cheek bones ever so tempting... And he was so sincere...

 
**Cleopatra:**
Yes... I'd like to see my Caesar again...!

Everyone, emergency huddle.

 
**Mash:**
Master...

 
**Elisabeth:**
This is bad. She's talking about THAT Caesar, right?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Caesar, one of the three least trustworthy Servants in Chaldea, and almost always the mastermind behind everything.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...By the way, this is what Chaldea's Caesar looks like.

 
**Ozymandias:**
...!

 
**Nitocris:**
Gahgh!?

 
**Mash:**
...They both passed out.

 
**Mash:**
Oh no. It looks like King Ozymandias is holding his stomach and trying to hold back his laughter...

 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, it's quite a shock to see Caesar for the first time...

Should we tell her the truth?

 
**Mash:**
...I don't think we should...
We would be destroying her dream...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...But we should tell her someday.

 
**Tristan:**
How sad... People change...
They say aging isn't ugly, but...

 
**Tristan:**
...This goes beyond aging...
Please forget this song...

 
**Tristan:**
This is definitely a severe case of stress eating...
Oh, how sad...

 
**Tristan:**
I have only seen this level of stress in Agravain...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Cleopatra:**
You look like you're having fun over there!
Let me join in too!

 
**Cleopatra:**
And why are the great pharaohs collapsed on the floor like they had a sudden stomach ache or something!?

 
**Mash:**
H-Hold on a second!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? What's wrong?
Did you call me? Want me to answer?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-Wait. Hold on!
Don't just Rayshift without my permi&mdash;

Doctor?
Doctor...!?

H-He really did Rayshift...!

This is bad!
That means...!

VENI!

 
**Cleopatra:**

This voice...!

 
**Mash:**
Oh... He really did come...

 
**???:**
VIDI!

 
**Cleopatra:**
My Caesar...!?
To think I can meet you again at last!

 
**Cleopatra:**
I-I need a mirror.
Does anyone have a mirror!?

 
**Cleopatra:**
Is my makeup running? We were just fighting after all!
Is it okay? Is it okay!?

 
**???:**
Now all I have to do is show myself!

 
**Cleopatra:**
My Cae&mdash;

 
**Caesar:**
IT IS I!

 
**Cleopatra:**
WHAT!?

 
**Caesar:**
Hahaha. It's been a while, Cleopatra. Hmm? I guess this is the first time meeting each other as Servants.

 
**Cleopatra:**
...

 
**Cleopatra:**
...

 
**Cleopatra:**
... (THUD)

 
**Mash:**
Yeah, I thought so...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I guess she couldn't accept reality and escaped it by fainting...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Humans are frail beings. They should just be positive as long as they have something to strive for.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, a Holy Grail fragment came out.
I'm going to collect it.

 
**Cleopatra:**
...Uuugh... Round... I saw something round...
Rolling... Rolling around... Uuuugh...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...I can't tell her to leave with the pyramid right now...

 
**Elisabeth:**
Let's have her rest here until her emotional scars heal.

 
**Mash:**
Once Halloween starts, she might calm down a little bit too.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, let's all have a very fun Halloween for her sake too!

 
**Caesar:**
Very well!
So who should I trick&mdash;I mean, persuade?

 
**Caesar:**
I haven't made much of an appearance lately!
My wit is so sharp right now, it's on par with a Lancer!

 
**Mash:**
You should stay away until Cleopatra's emotional scars heal...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...
