# The Great Tale of Demons - Onigashima

## Prelude
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, I brought Senpai.
What did you want to talk about?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you. Sorry for the short notice, but we have a problem. I've just detected the development of a peculiar Singularity.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Thought so. Where is it?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, about that...
It's in Japan.

 
**Mash:**
Really... Again?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, again. What's more, it's not that far off in time from when you were in Kyoto.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Normally, this era of Japan would have nothing to do with the Foundation of Humanity&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, if left alone, this abnormality could contradict that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We've encountered unusual circumstances before, but this one takes the cake.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't even predict what kind of situation awaits you at your Rayshift destination.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All I can do is prepare for whatever you encounter.
Will you still go, Fujimaru?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Of course.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You can count on me!
 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Excellent! That's very reassuring. At this rate, I can't really call you a rookie Master anymore.

 
**Fou:**
Foou... Foooou!

 
**Mash:**
Fou will be coming with us too?
That would be great!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Haha, according to Mash, Chaldea's very own lucky animal.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Only Mash really knew Fou before Fujimaru arrived, huh? Even named him. I guess he's an essential member of the team now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, Fou, please take care of these two.
I'll give my best to support you guys from here as well.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou!

 
## Act 1: "Three Animal? Companions"
 
**Mash:**
Imaginary existence defined.
Rayshift completed.

 
**Mash:**
Where are we?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh! I'm getting a clear visual from you.
That's great!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I have confirmed the coordinates as well.
You're located on an island near Honshu.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Remember when you Rayshifted to Kyoto before?
It's that island you could just barely see then.

 
**Mash:**
I see. So it's from that time...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's the situation in the surrounding area?

 
**Mash:**
The situation? Let me see.
From an overall view of the island...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash?

 
**Mash:**
...It's nothing. You see...
My frame of reference may not be accurate.

 
**Mash:**
Since we've brought someone more knowledgeable about Japan this time, I want to ask her opinion.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Heh heh heh. If our battlefield is the Land of the Rising Sun, then it is only natural for me to lead the charge.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I am unaccustomed to killing monsters, but there is no finer warrior across the Land of the Rising Sun than I!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I will leap even when there are no ships! Your humble Servant, Ushiwakamaru, has hastened here knowing my Master's in danger!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Well, the truth is Fou led me me here, but that's another story. I really wanted that sweet red bean jelly.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Ohh, so that's why there was some jelly in the Coffin...)

 
**Mash:**
I appreciate your support, Ushiwakamaru. It's very reassuring having you here. It makes sense too, settings-wise.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Of course. I believe so as well.
I have a feeling that I will play a great role this time!

 
**Fou:**
Fo&mdash;u!

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Now then, Ushiwakamaru, does anything on this island look unusual to you?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Anything unusual?
Let me see...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
!!!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I can't believe this... quite mystifying.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
The shape...of this island.
Can this be the rumored...

 
**Mash:**
...I knew it. There is something wrong here.
The shape of this island is inconceivable.

 
**Mash:**
It is just like an illustration from a children's book.
So simple... it is like that island&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, a reading I've never seen before is approaching your location! What's this... I can't even tell its shape!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's like an illustration of birds and beasts dancing, frolicking, and playing sumo...

 
**???:**
Ooooo... Ooooohhhhhhhh!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
How utterly strange!
It's like the oni in paintings, my lord!

 
**Mash:**
They're attacking!
We have no choice but to treat them as an enemy.

 
**Mash:**
Orders, please, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ugh, how disappointing.
Oni or not, their heads roll all the same.

 
**Fou:**
Fo&ndash;u...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
However, the fact remains that they were extraordinary opponents.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oni are far stronger than humans and are driven by stronger desires. You can call them the manifestation of evil.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Fortunately their numbers are few.
However, the problem is&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. It has become more apparent that there is definitely something wrong with this island.

 
**Mash:**
It looks like it came straight out of a fairy tale.
On top of that, menacing oni actually live on it.

 
**Mash:**
Based on this information, this place must be&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Can it be... Onigashima?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I knew it... Onigashima?
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes. It only makes sense to assume so.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No wonder the data on this island doesn't match that of the previous Singularities. I know it's unbelievable, but it seems we're in the world of fairy tales.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oni-type Servants aside, the fact that there are plain and simple oni living on this island is all the evidence we need.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It goes without saying, but there is no record of this island in the seas around Japan.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't even pinpoint the temporal coordinates of that island. Well, something similar happened last time in Heian-period Kyoto...

 
**Fou:**
Foufou.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That's correct. Even I am not aware of this island.
It probably did not exist during my brother's lifetime.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...What a waste. If islands this interesting truly existed,
I am certain I could have pleased my brother this time around...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm. Something that shouldn't exist is there.
A fantasy that's never meant to be is manifesting.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That island is also part of the abnormality.
In other words, there's a possibility it was created.

 
**Mash:**
An island of this size?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It is not impossible. In Japanese mythology, the islands that make up Japan were created by the gods.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Have you heard the tale of Amenonuboko? The gods formed the island and created the nation with their Authority.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, I can tell you about that later.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even though that island was mentioned in human history, it didn't actually exist in history.

 
**Mash:**
So someone made fairy tales, fantasy, into reality?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. That also means whoever made that island must be quite powerful.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Building an island that never existed before...
That most certainly is not something a human could do.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
It would be difficult for my brother as well. Politically. Which means... Yes, our enemy is clear.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Both oni and the island Onigashima...
Yes, I would agree the answer is clear.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But it is still too soon to draw any conclusions.
I want you to investigate with extreme caution.

 
**Mash:**
Okay.
Let us proceed with care, Master.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Singularity response I'm picking up is located at the highest, most remote part of the island.

 
**Mash:**
From what I can see, it looks like a steep, rocky mountain is the highest point of the island.

 
**Mash:**
It looks like it won't be easy to reach from here.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Even the longest journey begins with a single step!
 
**Mash:**
Yes. You're right, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
We should progress steadily, one step at a time&ndash;
Like the journey we've been on so far.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Let's see how far we can get.
 
**Mash:**
Hehe... That's right. Senpai, you always inspire us to go down the right path with your words.

 
**Mash:**
That may indeed prove to be the shortest way to reach our goal.

 

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way, Ushiwaka.
Are you familiar with folklore?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not just tales from your time, but those popular after that as well.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes. You need not worry about that. I, Ushiwaka, have been diligently studying such things in Chaldea.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Naturally, the tale of Onigashima, as well as Kobutori Jisan, Shita-kiri Suzume, The Crab and the Monkey, the Thief Ninja Jiraiya,

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
and many others. I love them! So speaking of Onigashima, the tale of Momotarou is definitely what comes to mind.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Exchanging millet dumplings to gain three companions: a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and then defeating the oni of Onigashima&mdash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Heh heh! Master, if you are Momotarou, then I must be the dog, eh?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I myself am a dog person, so all the better. A cat ignores commands, but a dog is devoted to its master.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
If you order me to, I will gladly line the island shore with the heads of all the oni.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Ushiwaka, it definitely doesn't sound like a joke when you say it... Besides, you ARE a master of combat...

 
**Fou:**
Fou! Foufou!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What? You would like to play the dog as well, Fou!? Well, for certain... You do have the qualifications...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But I shall not be outdone! Whichever of us can perform most like a dog shall be the winner! Let's go!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Oh... Ushiwakamaru and Fou have gone running off.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, well. We'll just have to leave the scouting up to those two.

 
**Mash:**
Uh!? It seems Ushiwakamaru has found something.
She's rushing back in a hurry... What's the matter?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My lord! I have news!
There is someone lying unconscious over there!

 
**???:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This... This is a Servant response.
He's a Servant! And&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Oni! The person on the ground is surrounded by oni!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Let's rescue them, Mash!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Defeat the oni!

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Master, orders, please!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My lord, I shall obey your orders to the very fullest! Come, demons! Quench my Usumidori's thirst!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Ugh! There are so many!

 
**???:**
Ohhh...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My lord! This one on the floor has regained consciousness.

 
**???:**
Who...are...you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Let's talk later!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
We are Momotarou and friends!
 

 
**???:**
???

 
**???:**
...I don't understand, but...
I do know...that you're fighting the oni.

 
**???:**
All...to save...me.
In that case...

 
**???:**
...Even though I'm physically and mentally exhausted... Even though I'm weak...

 
**Mash:**
One of the oni just went down!
What happened!?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
A knife! Nay, a ninja kunai! What a swift, clean throw... Who are you?

 
**???:**
...Apologies. Although I'm not anyone of note...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...My name is Fuuma Kotarou. For some reason that is beyond me, I am the fifth Kotarou.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fuuma Kotarou!? The leader of the Fuuma ninja and disruption brigade of Soshu province that served under the Hojo clan?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Yes, that one. I really don't want to get boiled in a pot. However, for now&mdash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I will repay your help and do what is right. Do not expect much of me, but I will begin exterminating the oni.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You are a young man oddly lacking in spirit, but that is unimportant! Continue, I will leave any backup to you!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Here we go...!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ooh! Another kunai between the eyes!
Now that's flawless accuracy! Well done, Kotarou!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh... Thank you. You look awfully cold, but your agility is unparalleled.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hahaha! To think you'd worry about me on the battlefield! Continue to watch my back, Kotarou!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Those quick and daring movements... So that's a ninja!
I have only ever heard of them before.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I too have learned similar arts from the Tengu, but I can tell the real deal is different.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I wonder if my brother would be happy if I mastered such skills? ...After this, please train me!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, I cannot... I'm no good at teaching people...
Um, and you are?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, I beg your pardon.
My name is Ushiwakamaru.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ushiwaka... Ohh, samurai of the Minamoto clan. I don't really like samurai...but... you're a comrade. And if it's Minamoto... things are different.

 
**Mash:**
We can speak later!
The third enemy wave is approaching!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Damn, there are too many! They're like a swarm of mosquitoes! They just keep popping up one after the other!

 
**Mash:**
We're completely surrounded!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It seems that all the oni in the area have gathered here... Sorry. I should have been more cautious.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That doesn't matter anymore.
 
**Mash:**
Just as Master says. We should only focus on fighting our way out of this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
No, it is my fault as well.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. If we had known so many would come, we could have handled it differently...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If only we'd made withdrawing our priority from the start. But, well... Would've, could've, should've...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We just have to watch for our chance now!
Fujimaru, give them orders!

 

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Haaa!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...It's a problem that there is no enemy general either. One sure way to victory is to take out the leader first.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My lord, if you command it, I, Ushiwakamaru, am willing to face ten thousand foes to take an enemy general's head&ndash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...But if there's no general to begin with, there's nothing that can be done. The problem is simply numbers now.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Is there any way to stop them?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...There's no point in keeping this a secret any longer considering the situation...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ushiwaka, girl in the dark armor...
and you, Fujimaru.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I am a lone Servant whose fate has called me to this place.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I am still neither your ally nor your enemy.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
As such, I have hesitated to show you my trump card... my Noble Phantasm.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
But you have, in truth, concerned yourselves over me, a novice. Therefore&mdash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I, Fuuma Kotarou, shall live up to my duty, and loyally honor your sincerity.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
This is not our sacred Mt. Ashigara, and none of my invisible and swift disruption brigade are present.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I, Kotarou, will entrust you with our secret...
Not as the leader of the Fuuma clan, but as a friend.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Uh, which means...?
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, this is a serious situation!
The poor lonely fellow is plucking up his courage for us!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Wow! You really can speak properly!
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My lord! This is serious!
It's an important moment for Kotarou!

 

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Um, may I continue?

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Then, once again...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Master. My Noble Phantasm has the ability to summon the Fuuma clan...my followers' spirits into battle. Their numbers alone won't be outdone by these oni.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Although it won't annihilate them, it will create a diversion.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Understand that this could be the chance to turn the tables on them. Upon your signal, I will release my Noble Phantasm.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I see. So you will distract them.
However...even if there is that chance...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
We need a burst of heavy firepower to cut through the enemy ranks. My Noble Phantasm is Anti-Personnel, and Mash's is for protection...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Kotarou, it pains me to say this, but we don't have the strength to overcome the situation&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Huh!?
What's that sound&mdash;!?

 
**Mash:**
S-Something is approaching!
With immense intensity, too!

 
**Mash:**
It's coming from...the top of that cliff!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
That's...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That's...!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He jumped...right off...the top of that cliff!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey there! I came here to see what's stinkin' up the place and what do I find?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's a golden party, guys!
Don't you agree, Boss!

 
**Mash:**
You're&mdash;Kintoki the Axe Bearer!
No, I mean, Mr. Golden!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What? Kintarou?
Where is he, Mash?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
The only thing I see is a disgusting creature who's trying too hard to look like a foreigner...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
What!?
That's...Sakata...Kintoki?

 
**Mash:**
Yes. You may find it hard to believe,
but that there is Mr. Golden.

 
**Mash:**
We were shocked by him at first too!
Oh, but... today he's worse than usual...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Th-That's right. What the heck is that metal, shiny, motorcycle-like thing!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Tch! Can't you hear that? Listen! Listen to it!
You know you can hear it! Listen to this bad boy!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Come on! Clean out your ears and listen to this!
This here is my one and only partner!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The awesome acceleration blasts it across a hundred miles in an instant! This jet engine would blow away a hundred bears if they stood in your way!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is&mdash; This is truly goooooooolden!
This baby here is the legendary bear on Mt. Ashigara!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is the Hyper Ultra Dangerous Machine&ndash;
Golden Bear!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Th-That's... SO COOOOL!
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Heh heh! I knew you'd get it, Boss!
This Bear here is one hellavuh beast, isn't he!?

 
**Fou:**
Foufou!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, pup! You get it too, huh? You show promise!
How about I dye your fur gold, huh?

 
**Fou:**
...Foun...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
...
 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Dang... You guys... Yeah, I know, I know...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Everyone is the same at first... This baby is so impressive that you can hardly breathe, let alone speak...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's what makes Bear here so awesome...
He even frightens me deep down...

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You really are an idiot, aren't you?
Enough of that, Kintoki!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Would you take a look around!? Quit acting like some high-school kid who just got their drivers license!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey! I'm an adult, man!
I've got my license for large motorbikes!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Wait, that's not the point.
Okay, fine! Say no more, Mad Doc!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I heard about everything at the mountain pass teahouse!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? Mad Doc?
Me?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, what the hell are those oni over there!?
Is that some kind of joke? Some face they got there!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm an expert in killing oni, ya know! But even I never saw anything with such a cartoonish, dopey face!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Dang! I don't know why, but that is hilarious!
This is so funny, I'm dying of laughter! Gyahahahaha!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Is that... really... Sakata...Kintoki!?

 
**Mash:**
Stop! Stop, Mr. Golden!
This is no time to be laughing your head off!

 
**Mash:**
Only the bad guys do that kind of stuff!
You'll disappoint the children!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What? Really?
The last thing I want to do is disappoint the kids...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Ah, well, gee. Sorry.
I wonder what got into me...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
For some reason, I couldn't help laughing when I saw those guys. I must have seen them somewhere before...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ya know... It's like one of those strange memories from childhood that hits you right in the funny bone.

 
**Oni:**
Gahr... Gaaaaaaahhrrr... Gyaaaaaaaaarrrrrr!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, I guess this is no time for me to be laughing.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As usual, I have no idea why I was summoned, but it's obvious what I have to do.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm needed at this instant!
That's what my Rider Suit is telling me!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's saying, “You must ride faster than the wind, Golden!”

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Then the only thing left to do is to exterminate those oni! Right, Boss? Right, missy with the shield!?

 
**Mash:**
Yes! Kintarou the Axe Bearer&mdash;
You're needed front and center, Mister!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Okay! We'll break through with that golden Noble Phantasm!
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Let's go, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
It's a golden attaaaack!
 
**Mash:**
M-Master?

 
**Mash:**
I'm a little surprised by your unusually high spirit...
In any case!

 

 
**Mash:**
Kotarou, please!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh... Right!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
My immortal shinobi, I shall prep you here once more&ndash;
Go! Immortal Chaos Brigade!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey! Hey! What the heck is that, you...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh... I'm sorry.
Have I...done anything to offend you?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's one hellavuh cool name for a Noble Phantasm!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You've got damn good taste, dude! Just stick a “Golden” in there, and it'll be perfect!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
R-Right... Thanks...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hah! But I won't be bested&ndash;
I'm blowing these guys away!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Come on, you stinking oni!
Imma send you back to hell!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Quick as lightning, faster than a bullet, with a body as bright as gold! My sacred steed, Bear!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyone who can keep up, follow me!
Ride behind if you'd like!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But make sure you're insured if you do!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Because I ain't got no brakes! If you get thrown off, you'll end up in the depths of hell!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
!!!

 
## Act 2: "Attack on Onigashima"
 
**Mash:**
Now that we've come this far, we should be all right.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whew... Somehow we made it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let me express our gratitude again, Kotarou, Kintoki.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...No. I...should be the one thanking you.
I was the reason we got into that mess to begin with...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. Now that we have the opportunity, let me ask you. Why were you surrounded by them back there?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I was...summoned to this island not long ago.
I don't know the reason...but I can speculate.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
&ndash;It's the oni. It's because I...am a Heroic Spirit deeply connected with oni.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What do you mean by that?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
A secret technique of the Fuuma... is to turn into an oni. That is why... there are tales of me... as an oni.

 
**Mash:**
You can...turn into an oni?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Not as of this moment.
That Noble Phantasm is sealed.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
However... There were oni right in front of my eyes.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I thought if I could observe them, study them up close, I might be able to absorb their behaviors and unleash my Noble Phantasm...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Now I know it was a mistake. One group of oni called in another, and that turned into a chain reaction&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And things ended up like that.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I haven't even fully grasped the layout of the island yet...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It was a reckless move for me to make... Usually someone else would do the scouting for me...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
So I'm not used to doing it myself...
I feel so embarrassed right now...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Come on! Don't worry about it, kid! What happens in Onigashima stays in Onigashima, right!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So what if you lost your way?
Speaking of which, I got lost too!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyway, I've got to see some more of those fancy ninja moves you have. You're as fantastic as you look!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh...um, I'm honored...to hear you say that, Kintoki.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(He's becoming even more embarrassed...)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right, thank you Kintoki.
You really saved us out there.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Nah, I didn't do anything for you to thank me, Doc.
I just enjoyed blowing them away with my ride.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...But ya know. Like that time at Rashomon, things might be complicated here.

 
**Mash:**
...You're right.

 
**Mash:**
We're out of trouble for the time being, but we're simply back to where we started.

 
**Mash:**
What is with this Onigashima? What is up with the oni? The mystery still remains.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Precisely. Kintoki, Kotarou. Our purpose here is to solve the mystery behind this island.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I realize I'm asking you this again, but will you help us?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Yes. I am indebted to you. I shall help you.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Besides, I think fighting the oni will help me further develop the secret arts of the Fuuma clan.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The same with me. This sounds sappy, but companions make journeys, and kindness makes the world better.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're already my comrades and riding buddies. Once your butt is on my machine, we go all the way together.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But just like I said with those oni&ndash; I'm not responsible for what happens to you if you fall off!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Besides, I can't just ignore the evil these oni are up to. Ya know, I got a reputation to keep.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As Kintarou, if I don't hunt oni, then what am I doing here? Well, I guess I could ride my bike!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...I'm sensing a very passionate gaze. Who is it?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Here, it's me! Please forgive me! I am deeply moved seeing how the great Sakata Kintoki is standing right in front of me!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What? You know me?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes, of course. You are one of my ancestor's... Minamoto-no-Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings! The brave exploits of Kintoki are renowned!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
There is nothing more heroic than the tales that were made by Kintarou of Mt. Ashigara!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I read all of your stories back in Chaldea!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Kotarou is also nodding silently.)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
(...Actually, I was shocked by the foreign-looking blond hair... But it must be some madness.)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
(I'm sure it's... you know, like teenage rebellion against his mother or something like that.)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ehh...well, all I did was go wild with my boss...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You lookin' at me like that is kinda embarrassing. But if my old boss is your ancestor, then you're a Minamoto too?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes! My father is Yoshitomo, my mother is Tokiwa, and of course, my older brother is Yoritomo. I am Ushiwakamaru!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Heh-heh! I see, I see... Hold on! Hey!
Don't get so close! Quit your jumping up and down too!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh! I'm terribly sorry. I'm just so excited!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(Her armor is way too flashy!
Is that because she's a Rider!? Is that why!?)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(Is this the default style for later Minamoto generations? I can practically see everything! And on her hips... Those are her panties!)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(Dang! Talk about an aggressive outfit... the Minamoto armor is great, dangerous, and revolutionary!)

 
**Mash:**
Kintoki started blushing and turned away.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
His hair is different and he's riding a motorcycle, but he's not any different than the usual Kintoki.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Most of all, he's still a companion that we can rely on. Anyway, I'd like you to start by gathering information&ndash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Wait, something is coming!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes! Oni are approaching! But there aren't that many... Probably a scouting party. Stop them before they can call their friends!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whew, we got through that somehow...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You really are an amazing ninja.
Your ability to detect enemies is unparalleled.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
He did notice the enemies before you, Doctor.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Simultaneously! It was simultaneous!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's a time lag, you know, so he has the advantage.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I think I'd like his help from now on.
 

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I'm very sensitive to the presence of others...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I will do my best to be of assistance to you.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...

 
**Mash:**
What seems to be the matter, Kotarou?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...No, it's nothing.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
(...I sensed someone looking at me just now...
Was it just my imagination?)

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, I've sent Kotarou and Kintoki out on a recon and scouting mission.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
As for us, we should go to check on the safety of the area.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. First of all, let's take a peek over that cliff and get a look around.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Good idea. If the view is good, we might be able to see something.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I, Ushiwaka, have great confidence in my vision.
That's because I was raised on Mt. Kurama!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
How is it? Can you see anything?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Yes. I can see oni... and humans as well, gathering in an open space.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Humans? I see, so there are some on the island.
What is the situation like?

 
**Mash:**
A forced labor camp... It looks like oni are supervising the humans and making them work.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes. They're wielding whips and shouting&ndash; It looks like there are some oni that understand human language.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
The humans there are digging holes in the ground, and carrying dirt and logs...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. That really does sound like a forced labor camp.
I wonder why the oni are making humans do that?

 
**Mash:**
I don't know. All I know is there are a lot of oni gathered there.

 
**Mash:**
Even if we want to free the people working there, we'll just end up in the same mess as before.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...That's right. And there's more than just that one place where oni are forcing humans to work.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
To try and free everyone from all those camps...
I wouldn't say that's a realistic idea.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It would be best to keep making our way inland, and do something about the mastermind... I think.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Gah! Don't sneak up on us like that!
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I'm sorry... I'm a ninja so...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Welcome back. What did you find?
 
**Mash:**
E-Even when Kotarou sneaks up like that, you're still not phased. You really are something, Master.

 

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
The information I have is just as I said.
I found several work locations, and...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
A way to get to the middle of this island&mdash;to the highest point.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, so you've found a route there?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Simply put, there is an easy path.
It is not difficult to traverse. But&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...But what?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
To get to the top, we have to go through three gates that the oni have constructed along the way. There is no way around them.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
And...they seem to be closed at all times.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
To open those gates, you need the keys from three great oni who appear to be the gate keepers.

 
**Mash:**
Three great oni guarding the three gates... I see.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
They also appear to be the ones commanding the lesser oni...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
They are far more powerful than the lesser oni, with strength I've never seen before.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
And what's more, I think...the oni have hired a terrifying guard.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Unfortunately, that's when it got away from me...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
It got away?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
The oni that I extracted this information from.
I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at interrogation.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
However, that oni didn't seem to be lying, so I believe it was a good trade-off...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hahaa! You didn't have the desire to go after it and kill it, huh? You are very kind, Kotarou.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
If it had been me, I'd have gone right after it, and made it regret its cowardice.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, that would have been a waste of time...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Ushiwakamaru, who grins while speaking of violence, and Kotarou, always calm and unnervingly rational...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Japan's Heroic Spirits are, how to put this... They look approachable enough, but are actually terrifying...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I know what you mean.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Kotarou is a ninja after all.
 

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...No, I'm terribly sorry. I should have been more diligent with my work...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I should have finished it off.
You see, this is what happens&mdash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
The beasts have been set upon us.
No matter how pitiable they are, oni are still oni.

 
**Mash:**
No, it isn't wrong to be compassionate, Kotarou! The ones to make a mistake are the oni coming to retaliate!

 
**Mash:**
Attack! We'll cut our way through them, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Kintoki should be back here soon.
Where is that guy?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I wonder if something happened to him...
I should have been the one to do all of the scouting.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I mean...that thing he rides... It's so...noisy...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
(Nods in agreement.)

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, it's presumptuous to think he would ride the whole time... I mean, seriously, why would he do that...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha! I'm really glad you have common sense, Kotarou.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Uh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's not be negative all the time and think something positive. We have to give some credit to the mobility of that Bear.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He could be cruising around the lower part of the island at full speed. Let's wait a little longer.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
You're right. It is presumptuous of me to worry about him...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Shh! Quiet. Mr. Roman, do you detect anything?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Spot on, Kotarou. Something is approaching.
It definitely isn't Kintoki.

 
**Mash:**
Understood. Let's hide for the time being and watch.

 
**Oni 1:**
Whew! ...What a pain. I'm beat...
This is rough... This is hell, man...

 
**Mash:**
...They've come from the labor camp.

 
**Mash:**
It seems they really can communicate. They look a little bit higher-ranked than those earlier ones...

 
**Mash:**
...They're probably like middle management.
But I can't be sure right now.

 
**Oni 2:**
Whew! ...It sure ain't easy making humans work.
They start slacking off if you aren't watching...

 
**Oni 3:**
Then again, if you so much as whip them, they die.
I wish they'd learn to be more brawny like us.

 
**Oni 3:**
What the heck do they eat anyway?
...They should eat rocks! That'll build up their grit...

 
**Oni 1:**
Absolutely right! To be honest, I'd rather do the work...
I mean, that'd finish the castle way faster, right?

 
**Oni 1:**
The boss should've just asked us to do it...
We'd get the work done in less than two days.

 
**Oni 1:**
Then we could go party in town!
I'm dying for some girls...

 
**Oni 2:**
Gyahahaha! With a face like that, your mom wouldn't even wanna be around! Anyway, I'm hungry. I'm gonna have some of that liver I brought.

 
**Oni 3:**
Seriously? You brought a lunchbox? You never forget, do you? And you're only a prison guard!

 
**Oni 2:**
I didn't bring this. I plucked the head off that useless old guy back there. It's a lame liver as well.

 
**Mash:**
...These oni... We might be able to talk with them, but oni and humans...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Stay calm, Mash. Oni have lives too, so they have complaints as well.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Well, at any rate, my lord, if you order me to do so, I will slice their heads off right away. How about it?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...So there are oni even here...
 
**Mash:**
W-Wait, Ushiwakamaru!
Let's observe a bit longer&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
...No, let's wait and see a little longer.
 
**Mash:**
That's right. This could be an ambush.
Let's observe for a little longer&ndash;

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hmm? I'm detecting something... Is this a Servant?
But Kintoki hasn't returned yet. What's this?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ah!
Fujimaru, over there!

 
**???:**
You there! What do you think you're doing?

 
**???:**
...How dare you kill an innocent old man for no reason! Like I thought, you're rotten to the core.

 
**Oni 1:**
Gya!?
Y-You're...

 
**???:**
My blade is unwavering. Swift as thunder, glittering like the snow, and merciful like the raining heavens.

 
**???:**
&ndash;Here is your punishment!
May you die in incredible agony!

 
**Oni 1:**
Gyaaaah!

 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai! A black-haired beauty is cutting down all the oni!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
(What incredible swordsmanship!
She slices through an oni's hard flesh like it was tofu!)

 
**Fou:**
Foufou!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We have no choice but to follow her lead!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
We can't let her fight alone!
 

 
**Mash:**
R-Right!
Let's go, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
I'm not detecting any more enemies...
But...I don't know...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Is something bothering you?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Is something different than usual?
 

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. I'm not sure how to put it, but there wasn't as much punch to them...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looking at the data, it seems they're made up of spiritual bodies on the inside.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They appear rough and crude, but in reality they could just be beings of higher spiritual existence.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't say all of the phantasmals in Japan are like this. Ushiwaka, what's your take?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You were raised by Tengu, right?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hmm, I was often told it was forbidden to speak about my masters, so I can't really give you the details, but...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Mystical creatures from this land are not terribly different than those from the West. They are mostly categorized as spiritual beasts or spirits of the dead.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Spiritual beasts are physical existences hidden from the human world. The other is born into this world as a living curse without physical form.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
These oni are the latter.
When I cut into them, there is no substance.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
They are like smoke that would kill you if inhaled.
They are born of a curse created by human deeds.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So they're not a living creature of any proper ecosystem. Okay, then that makes sense.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But this is no time to be talking casually! Fujimaru, put that pretty woman on camera!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've got to talk to her! She's got huge boo... I mean, she's got to be a huge source of information!

 
**???:**
My, where is that voice coming from?

 
**???:**
I sense someone both sensitive and discreet, and though he is timid, has high marks in versatility and reason...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Hate to break it to you, but he's a real chicken.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, shush Fujimaru, you don't have to compliment me like that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Who in the world are you...?
 
**???:**
Fufufu... Don't mind me too much.
I am merely a warrior passing by.

 

 
**???:**
Either way, let me express my gratitude for your efforts, nameless foreigners.

 
**???:**
Such unusual attire. How did you come to this island? There won't be any ship coming into the harbor for a while...

 
**???:**
&mdash;Oh my! Oh, my oh my oh my!
Such a preciously cute warrior. Who might you be?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My name is Mi... I mean, Ushiwakamaru. I admire how you did not give any ground when facing the oni.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You appear to be no ordinary swordsman.
You look as if you are a warrior of great renown.

 
**???:**
Well...fufufu... (Pat Pat)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Wha!? ...Uhm, uhh...

 
**???:**
Honestly, though, you really shouldn't pay me any attention.

 
**???:**
This time, I was only doing things for my own ends, and you only did what you did for yours&ndash;

 
**???:**
As a result, our paths just happened to cross.

 
**???:**
If fortune brings us together once more, then so be it.

 
**???:**
Now then, I will be going.

 
**Mash:**
She left...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You should've stopped her!
Aww man, I really wanted you to stop her!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...No, we never could have stopped her. To question the activities of someone of such high rank is tantamount to rudeness.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...I am a man that lives in the shadows, but even I could tell what her rank is.

 
**Mash:**
She was a woman with an odd aura.
A magnanimous, maternal aura.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Uhmmm... That person... Hmmm?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So you know her?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
No, it's definitely the first time I've met her.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But her aura is one that I seem to know from somewhere, her aroma... How can I put it... It's kind of nostalgic... Hmm?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(She's moving her hands like she could physically rewind her brain.)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, there's no use pondering over what we don't know. At any rate, right now we&ndash;Huh?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Sorry about that! I'm a little late.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Bear here is getting way out of hand!
We rode way further than I originally planned.

 
**Mash:**
Ah, Kintoki.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...You're all right.
It's good to...see you back again...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Huh? What's this? Have you had yourselves a fight? Damn! I missed out on the fun. That's not fair, you guys.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Actually, we ourselves aren't entirely satisfied with the battle either...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Most of this was handled by an armored warrior that just happened to be passing by. We hardly participated at all.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
An armored warrior?
There was someone like that here?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. You could say she had terrific skill, as well as terrific va-voom... she was in many ways the essence of maternity...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
&mdash;Huh?

 
**Mash:**
Though she wore armor, she stood slender and tall, and she was soft...or you could say attractive, I guess.

 
**Mash:**
At any rate, she carried herself with such charm that she gave off a lovely aroma. It appeared as if she was a warrior with renown, but...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...What? You sure?
Could it be...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, Kintoki?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, no, it's nothing. Forget about that.
What's the situation now?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're right. Let us compare notes.
First&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So... we can't get to the top without taking out three great oni, huh? And those dudes are golden strong.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All right, this is getting interesting! There's nothing better than an easy-to-understand situation!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I knew you'd say something like that, Kintoki!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I...agree.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahh... It's always like this with people that are always ready for a fight... Kintoki, what did you find out on your recon?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, yeah. Well, you already know about the labor camps where the oni are making humans work...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But I also found a place similar to a human settlement.
I only got a glimpse of it from far away though.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A settlement, huh? Obviously it would be inefficient to keep them working constantly. It's necessary to give the humans a place to live as well.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's dangerous, but we might be able to get more information if we go there.

 
**Mash:**
We'll defeat the great oni defending the gates, and get their keys. Then we'll go to the settlement for information.

 
**Mash:**
We have a mission for the moment.
Let's be careful, Master!

 
## Act 3: "The First Great Oni Appears!"
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
By the way, my lord.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Thanks to your integrity, you have gained both Kotarou and Kintoki as companions.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
When we arrived here, we went over this once, but how about we discuss our roles one more time?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I say this as I believe if we settle it beforehand, we will be able to better fulfill our roles.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Our roles?
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes! The three animal companions of Momotarou, obviously! The original famed oni-exterminating companions!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Oh, you mean like Momotarou's companions...
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes, that's exactly right. Since we are exterminating oni, then it is a great honor!

 

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
First of all, naturally I am the dog&ndash;

 
**Fou:**
Fou! Foufou!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, that's right. Fou and I are still in competition.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Regardless, whether we aim for the same role or not, we should declare which one we desire.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
From here onward, I think it best for our lord to decide which role is appropriate depending on our actions.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Now then, Mash, what about you?

 
**Mash:**
What? Me?
I'm not particularly...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash is also very much like a faithful dog.
How about that?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Really...

 
**Fou:**
Fouu?

 
**Mash:**
Doctor! You keep out of this!
I don't need any kind of role!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You have no desires, Mash?
Then, how about the pheasant role...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Uh?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
On close inspection, you seem like you might be a bird, Kotarou. Your hair style and color kind of remind me of one.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Are you happy with being the pheasant?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
A bird... Yes, that's nice. If you don't mind me playing that role, then I don't mind.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, that was a quick answer. Well, that settles the role of the pheasant. Next is Kintoki&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No can do, Ushiwaka. That's not something I'm going to do. I just ain't into it.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What? Why not? (He must have known I was going to make him the monkey!?)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My name is Golden. Call me Golden. I mean, you and I have fought together in many battles.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We're already best buddies, right?
So just call me by my True Name.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Isn't that right, Kotarou? You're thinking the same!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...W-Well, yes. Golden...does have a nice...ring to it,
I think...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Also, Ushiwakamaru, I'm not so sure about making Kintoki the monkey. I mean, there isn't a monkey as strong as he is.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
If there were, then that would be the end of Japan. The future Nikko Edomura Park is still to come, you know.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
W-Well, yes, I understand that, but...
Why do you have to get so defensive, Kotarou?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Yes, when it comes to Kintoki, Kotarou's eyes become quite serious...)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Hmm. What you say does make sense though, Kotarou.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Kintoki... I mean, Golden is best suited for the role of Momotarou.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But our Master is in that role. Perhaps we will have to employ a double-Momotarou system&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What? The monkey role? Nothing wrong with that. I'll take it. I was raised in the mountains, so I'm perfect for it.

**Fujimaru 1::**
That was unexpected...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I thought he wouldn't like it.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't mind at all. You don't realize how strong a monkey is, do you?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The monkeys that lived on my mountain were crazy strong.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
They're on par with bears. There was even this one monkey I had a damn long sumo battle with.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
He had wicked thick arms and pitch-black hair.
But he had these sad eyes with a deep understanding.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That one was a wise mountain sage.
But when he got excited, he was like a storm!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
He'd pound his chest like a drum and walk like a beast, dragging his huge fists on the ground.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It was like all his wisdom transformed into muscle... Dang, thinkin' about this has me in the mood for some sumo!

 
**Mash:**
...Hmm, that probably wasn't a monkey, but more likely a mountain goril...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What kind of ecosystem was on that mountain that you grew up on?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Wow. I had no idea animals like that lived on the mountain... my training is still far from finished...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
At any rate, we've settled all three of the companions' roles! Now we can make headway as oni exterminators!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
All right, let's be going, my lord!
First we go to the great oni that's nearby!

 
**Mash:**
It seems...we're on the right track.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've identified a conspicuously large heat source! It's him! Just looking at this I can tell it's different than other oni!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No, wait!
There's also&ndash;a Servant there!

 
**Mash:**
Could this be the formidable guard that we heard about? Who is&ndash;

 
**Kojirou:**
...Aah.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Kojirou:**
Would it be all right if we spoke first?
I have a little something I wish to ask.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Yes.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Go right ahead.

 
**Kojirou:**
I am Sasaki Kojirou. The radiance of my secret technique was requested, so I was hired by the oni as a guard&ndash;

 
**Kojirou:**
Then, based on the absurd... Nay, bold idea that “Swallows and pheasants are all birds so they are basically the same, right?”

 
**Kojirou:**
...I was given the role of a 1-star pheasant-terminator, with the mission to slay the evil bird that could shoot beams out of its beak.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 
**Kojirou:**
...Now, where's the pheasant?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
He is right here.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Hello.

 
**Kojirou:**
You're a person!
What? Where is your beak!?

 
**Mash:**
That's what you're upset about?

 
**Kojirou:**
Of course I'm angry! I may be a recluse, but I don't have that much free time!

 
**Kojirou:**
You see... I came here seeking a swallow that is equal to the one I fought that day...

 
**Kojirou:**
But all I find is a spy with hair that looks like a bird!
This isn't what I was promised!

 
**Kojirou:**
You'd think you'd at least bring a Heroic Spirit that's a falconer, or one that turned into a bird in legends, or has some connection to birds!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ohh...I'm sorry... I don't think I can shoot beams, nor do I have beak...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Uhm, My name is Fuuma Kotarou. I'm the pheasant of the group. If it's ninjutsu you need, I might be able to do something...

 
**Kojirou:**
What? Fuuma Kotarou? The Fuuma Clan that's second only to Iga and Kouga ninjas?

 
**Kojirou:**
Well well, my apologies. If I could cross swords with the leader of the Fuuma, that would be enough to satisfy me.

 
**Kojirou:**
You have a good name, too. Kotarou. Kojirou. A peerless pair of names we have, and the beginning of a friendship.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, there will be no beginning.
From now on, I shall become the Kojirou-terminator.

 
**Kojirou:**
Why!? We are both Japanese Servants, right!?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Silence! Timid I may be, but there are three things that I cannot forgive!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
One, people who don't take care of their weapons.
Two, subordinates who chase away the deliveryman.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
And finally, three&mdash; Anyone who dares to rank my Fuuma Clan lower than Iga and Kouga!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
You, sir, have crossed the line! As the fifth leader of the Fuuma ninja, I shall take that rare sword as a trophy!

 
**Mash:**
There's a bit of self-interest in that anger, Senpai!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Whoa! That's pretty dang impressive! Maybe we outta change your role from the pheasant, eh?

 
**Kojirou:**
I see. I may not have stepped upon the tiger's tail, but it seems I have ruffled the bird's feathers. Disappointing, yet pleasing as well.

 
**Kojirou:**
Enough talk. Now we fight to the death.

 
**Kojirou:**
However, my good Kotarou, as an apology for my impolite remark earlier, let me give you some advice.

 
**Kojirou:**
This great oni's name is Kazakoemaru. According to the Oni King, he is heralded as the embodiment of speed.

 
**Kojirou:**
He cannot be beaten when it comes to speed. Even up against my sword. Heed that when you face him.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, hey! His speed can't be beaten? We'll see about that when he faces me and my Bear here!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All right! It's time to challenge him to a speed battle!
You climb on that oni and ease up to the line!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I don't think he means that kind of speed.
Probably...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
That is so like you, Kintoki. Overcoming an opponent in their area of expertise, that is what you would call a true victory&ndash;Isn't that right?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It is an attack they won't see coming.
It's bound to deal a huge blow to them psychologically.

 
**Mash:**
However, our opponent seems pretty confident in its ability. It might be difficult to beat it if we charge recklessly&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
In fact, if we are to take it on with speed, then I think we need to make the appropriate preparations.

 
**Mash:**
Do we fight against its strong point, or do we try some other method? I leave the decision about that up to you, Master.

 
**Mash:**
Whatever you choose, I will support you completely.
This could be a long fight, so let's all do our best, Master!

 
## Act 4: "Kazakoemaru Repelled!" [Decisive Battle]
 
**Kojirou:**
Ugh... Well done.

 
**Mash:**
W-We did it. That oni was terrifying and so resilient...
but somehow we took it down!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You underestimated us, didn't you, foolish samurai?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Bear here isn't all about speed.
His power and technique are golden level as well!

 
**Kojirou:**
Heh... To think I would lose to a mechanical horse and a ninja bird...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Don't forget the faithful dog that doesn't know how to stop!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(She finally admitted it!)

 
**Kojirou:**
As expected, going astray over feminine charms was my downfall... Their dumplings at the teahouse by the mountain pass were so delicious...

 
**Kojirou:**
A poem for the occasion. “Blue sky of summer, bashful upon the shoreline, my lovely Martha.”

 
**Kojirou:**
...Heh heh... Impossible... That will never happen...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The guard has succumbed...
He was elegant to the end...

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou.

 
**Mash:**
Well, we've finally gotten our hands on a key.
Now we can get past the first gate.

 
**Mash:**
We've made a little progress.
Let's keep up the hard work, Master!

 
## Act 5: "Of Oni and Men"
 
**Mash:**
This...is where the humans working on this island live?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is like a slum... I should have known that they'd only be provided with the bare minimum.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Most likely they've been brought here from the mainland. With this many, there's really nothing we can do for them.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We can't prepare a ship to take them to the mainland anytime soon, and we're not equipped as a rescue team to begin with.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
With our limited numbers, the best we can do is eliminate the cause. To rescue all these captured people, we need to make preparations.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...You are right.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
If we were to release them from these settlements and the labor camps, the oni would just bring them all back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. All we can do now is collect information.
Before any more troublesome oni arrive.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If we run into any oni, we'll just kick their asses. Man, why do the people here look like a bunch of wimps anyway?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
When the environment gets too harsh, sometimes humans give into despair... In the end, they just don't even think about it anymore.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...I'm sure the people here have fallen into that state.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Most of them just sit on the ground and hang their heads. They look like defeated soldiers.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But you would think that there was at least one person that we could talk to...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ah! There's one now that's walking with a firm stride.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hmm? W-Wait a minute. That's&ndash;

 
**Benkei:**
Oh! Master, and Lord Yoshitsune.
How fortunate. Ho ho!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Who the heck are you?

 
**Benkei:**
Ha ha mua ho ha ha! Don't you recognize me?
We met several times in Chaldea already.

 
**Benkei:**
Ho ho! I am Benkei, Musashibou Benkei.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Really? You're that very same Benkei?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
If that is true, then I cannot conceal the shame that I feel before everyone.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Benkei...I wouldn't mind calling you that... But aren't you just the one I pretend to ignore, Kaison&ndash;

 
**Benkei:**
The name is Benkei. Yes, Benkei.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
But what's with that body?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Have you been lifting weights?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That's it! Benkei! Aren't you a little too muscular!?

 
**Benkei:**
What are you talking about? Benkei is synonymous with a brawny build. This is the way I have always been.
Ho ho!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, nice bodybuilding!
How about us having a round of sumo wrestling?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh...then you'll need a referee...
If you don't mind, allow me...

 
**Benkei:**
I would be overjoyed to match strength with the peerless Sakata Kintoki! What a blessing it would be! Ho ho!

 
**Mash:**
I know that Benkei is already quite powerful...
but he seems a lot more powerful than usual...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sumo matches aside, please answer my questions first. Why are you here?

 
**Benkei:**
A retainer must follow his lord at all times. Of course,
I am here to aid the Master and Lord Yoshitsune.

 
**Benkei:**
There is another settlement higher up, so I went looking for you there, but couldn't find you.

 
**Benkei:**
I went elsewhere and searched about for you, and eventually ended up here.

 
**Benkei:**
I am very glad we could meet up.
Let us march forth and exterminate these oni!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Benkei:**
Oh, there's no need to worry. I have no interest in being either a dog, monkey or pheasant.

 
**Benkei:**
I am merely Lord Yoshitsune's weapon.
Use me as you wish.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I see. If you are just a disposable weapon then I have no problem keeping you around.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Something still feels off about you, but I can just dispose of you when I am done.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Ushiwaka can be quite cruel when it comes to anyone other than you, Fujimaru...)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That sounds fine by me.
The more the merrier, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Our weapons pack a helluva punch to boot.
I love this dangerous feeling. It totally feels like a war!

 
**Benkei:**
Oh... So you do understand. The aura given off by this seemingly meaningless... Actually, make that a literally meaningless collection of weapons.

 
**Benkei:**
Sakata Kintoki. I had heard that you are a reckless individual, but it seems like you are a man of refined taste!

 
**Benkei:**
Ho ho! ...I would like to have a sumo match here to deepen our friendship&ndash;

 
**Benkei:**
But, unfortunately, it seems others have come who wish to test their strength against yours.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's like Benkei says, there is an oni patrol approaching! There is no time to hide.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Let's go face them!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
With you by our side, we're sure to win, Benkei!

 
**Benkei:**
I was once known as Oniwaka, the Young Oni. Sit back and watch as I rampage as hard as any of them!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Benkei:**
If Buddha has ears for oni, may these prayers reach him. Namo...

 
**Mash:**
Even after defeating the oni, the people here won't even move a muscle.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They don't even have the will to resist. In the end, all we can do is get rid of the one behind everything.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tch! ...They've all got eyes like dead fish.
The food here must be pretty damn awful...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If I had the time, I'd go around and knock some golden energy into every single one of them.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Actually before that, they need breakfast.
You can't get any energy if you got nothing to burn.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If only Tawara was around...
That way I could at least make some rice balls...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Kintoki...making...rice balls!?
Kintoki can cook!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
S-So what, you got a problem with that? It's just rice balls, of course I can make them. I'm a man after all.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I mean, despite the way I look, I was brought up by a wealthy samurai general.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Even if we did nothing, we'd get served one hellavuh meal for breakfast. That just ain't my style.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I get really nervous if I gotta worry about table manners starting from breakfast, ya know? Rice balls are enough for me.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Yes, I know how you feel!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I always say something simple for breakfast is best, yet my subordinates somehow always got obsessed over it and would bring me too much!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ain't that right! I wanted to get out and play as fast as I could. I didn't want to just sit around eating all day!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, sounds like the kind of things said by boys that really gave their mothers a headache...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
At any rate, Kotarou, you and Kintoki seem to get along well. Are you fine with that?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You are the head of the Fuuma clan, right? Don't you think it would be bad for you to be getting along with an outlaw?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh...well, I..I guess so...
But, I mean, Kintoki is, well...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
(Good, good... I am not being lumped in as one of the outlaws. That's only natural, but still...)

 
**???:**
...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
(Again, someone is watching us...)

 
## Act 6: "Master and Servant"
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Um... Fujimaru.
I suggest that we stop our advance.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
There is what appears to be a checkpoint ahead.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hey, you there, sweaty Benkei. You came from the settlement ahead. How did you get around this?

 
**Benkei:**
I'm embarrassed to say... I didn't get through the checkpoint. I lost my footing and fell down the cliff.

 
**Benkei:**
It was a fortunate mistake. Thanks to that, I was able to arrive at the settlement you were at.

 
**Benkei:**
Dear me, am I ever embarrassed about that. If I hadn't been in good shape, I would have died instantly.

 
**Benkei:**
With age, my eyes have been opened to the greater truth: that muscle trumps wisdom!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hmm. You still don't look like Benkei to me, but whatever. Hanging out with you is fun, and you don't require any sympathy when you're left behind either.

 
**Benkei:**
Hahaha! You're sharper than ever, Lord Yoshitsune! You're really keeping me on my toes!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Hey, Boss. I know I'm not the one to say this, but are descendants of Minamoto always this unsettling?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Ushiwakamaru is a genius, after all...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
The line between genius and insanity is...you know...
 

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, my lord. Praising me as a genius in front of other people like that... It's pretty embarrassing...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...With her kind of one-way dependence and affection... I have no problem understanding just how difficult it was for Ushiwakamaru's brother...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I don't think that the path Benkei took was necessarily foolish.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
With mountains of this scale, you may as well ignore the roads when going down. Jumping off a cliff means you can forget about the gates.

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;The problem for us is having to go up the mountain.

 
**Mash:**
These are cliffs we cannot scale; even if we have the strength as Heroic Spirits,

 
**Mash:**
if the oni spotted us while we were climbing up, it would be the end of us.

 
**Mash:**
Ultimately, the only choice we have is to follow this mountain trail to the top.

 
**Mash:**
The path is narrow, and there are steep drops on either side... There's no other way around. What should we do, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Can't we force our way through?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The checkpoint itself is smaller than the gate guarded by the great oni...but the number of oni I'm detecting is quite high.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's a lookout as well, so it's nearly impossible without a plan.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Is there any way to get through?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I'm detecting a large number of oni from over there. It's too dangerous to try to force our way through.

 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You know...the one thing that my Bear can do is to bust into them at full throttle!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Well then...how about this?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
We'll distract the lookout and then sneak into the checkpoint.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
After that, we'll cause a commotion to throw them into confusion, and then right at that moment, Kintoki charges in&ndash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Basically, we'll conduct attacks from inside and out simultaneously.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You mean I'll show up at the very end?
Now that's what I call being a golden hero, man!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Let's try it out!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Got it. Just let me prepare a little for this...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
All right. How does this look?

 
**Mash:**
Wow! That's an amazing disguise! As expected of a ninja... Is that also part of Fuuma's secret techniques?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, it's simply a kind of makeup&ndash; I'm simply mimicking their looks. It's not that difficult at all.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
The secret technique of the Fuuma is to wield the power of a true oni, so that&ndash; Never mind, that's not important right now.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Let's infiltrate by acting as if we're bringing in fresh human laborers.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I'm sorry, everyone, but please let me tie this rope around your waists.

 
**Mash:**
It needs to look as real as possible. If you would, please.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Excellent. Now, then&ndash;

 
**Oni:**
&ndash;Gah!? Halt! Who are you!?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Gah ha ha! By the Great Oni's orders, I've captured more humans and I'm bringing them in. Let me through.

 
**Mash:**
(He talks like them, too!)

 
**Oni:**
Nobody told me about this...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
You know how bad communication is. If they're late, I'll catch hell. Get in touch with them later. Come on...

 
**Oni:**
Hmm... Yeah, well, I guess it's fine.
I'll just note what kind of humans you brought along...

 
**Oni:**
First, there's a fairly healthy human that's pretty darn pale...

 
**Oni:**
A powerful male that looks like he'll work hard.

 
**Oni:**
Is this a monk? I guess even humans need your type to relieve their discontent, huh?

 
**Oni:**
...Dang, you really caught one here...
This one's like a tsuchinoko...

 
**Oni:**
Oh! And this female certainly looks soft! Kyahaha!
I guess you'll be fixing meals for the humans, eh?

 
**Oni:**
And then&ndash;

 
**Oni:**
...

 
**Oni:**
...Wait.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...What is it?

 
**Oni:**
That one there just isn't right!
What the heck is with that shameless outfit?

 
**Oni:**
She's far too small to be doing any work that needs muscle. And I sure don't think she can do any woman's work.

 
**Oni:**
Just look how shameless she is! Are you sure the Great Oni said to bring this one!?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...(Not good!)

 
**Benkei:**
Hold it right there, Mr. Oni! Though I am a captive, let me, a monk, ask you a question!

 
**Benkei:**
You say there's a woman dressed shamelessly...
But is that what you really see?

 
**Oni:**
...Huh?

 
**Benkei:**
With all my training as a monk, I might sense her presence... However, I am not sure about the others... (Glance)

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
R-Right. What the heck are you talking about!?
There's nobody like that here.

 
**Oni:**
No, hold on. That one right there&ndash;

 
**Benkei:**
But still you insist? Then it must be true.
&ndash;She is a seductress!

 
**Benkei:**
Even an oni cannot resist being captivated by a seductress. Dangerous, dangerous. Far too dangerous. In that case, I shall eliminate the threat!

 
**Benkei:**
&ndash;Take that!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ouch!?

 
**Mash:**
(H-He just gave Ushiwakamaru a really nasty punch!)

 
**Benkei:**
...Whew. I have eliminated the threat. Namo.

 
**Benkei:**
Even if she was a seductress, then this should have taken care of it, right? Now then, I beg your pardon.

 
**Mash:**
(He's dragging along the completely unconscious Ushiwakamaru...)

 
**Mash:**
(Passing the flabbergasted guard&ndash;)

 
**Mash:**
(A-At any rate, we've passed into the checkpoint!)

 
**Oni:**
...Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
There really is something odd about you&ndash;!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
We've made it this far. Now that we're inside the guard will be easy.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
We just set off a false alarm, destroy the facilities, and lead them into infighting. We'll cause all kinds of confusion&ndash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It's about time. I'll send Kintoki the signal!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hah! Finally! That's the signal...
Let's rock! You and me, Kotarou, let's rumble!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Use that incredibly cool Noble Phantasm to mess them up! What was it called? The Immortal Golden Brigade?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think the name is a little different...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Yes! It is an honor for a Fuuma to be summoned by you, Kintoki! Take this! Immortal Golden Brigade!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's totally gotten into it! Is he going to be all right?

 
**Mash:**
Either way, thanks to Kintoki and Kotarou, the enemy is in disarray! Let's finish them off now, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We defeated the whole crowd of them.
Thank you, everyone... Especially you, Kotarou.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Not at all. I couldn't have done it alone.
We defeated them because we worked together.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
There were a couple of times that felt like we weren't going to make it. Especially when... Um...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Okay, the time has come. You, Benkei!
Right there! On your knees! Head down!

 
**Mash:**
(Ushiwakamaru already has her hand on her sword! Senpai! You have to stop her!)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Impossible, I mean...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I. TRUST. USHIWAKA.
 

 
**Benkei:**
Hahaha! All right, I see.
This brings back memories!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What?

 
**Benkei:**
Subscription list, you know. The subscription list.
This is just like that time. You remember that, right?

 
**Benkei:**
On our way to Hiraizumi, when we crossed the border of Kaga, and that Togashi fellow spotted you, Lord Yoshitsune.

 
**Benkei:**
I read a false subscription list, and later I ended up having to slap you around&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...You dare to speak of the subscription list? Do you even understand the meaning behind the tears shed by Benkei?

 
**Benkei:**
Of course I understand.
I am not Benkei just for the fun of it.

 
**Benkei:**
My body, my spirit, my belief are all true. If I ever make a mistake, then you may dismiss me on the spot.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Fine. That was quite a feat you accomplished with that dunderhead.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-Well, at least we got past that difficult spot.
Why don't we keep on moving ahead, okay?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ushiwakamaru, I understand how you feel, but...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I'm not angry. It was all thanks to Benkei that we got past that point.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...However, the mystery continues to deepen.
How come Benkei is so powerful on this island?

 
## Act 7: "Big Brother"
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Mash:**
You look troubled, Ushiwakamaru.
Is there something bothering you?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Of course. It's Benkei.
Also what happened at the gate back there.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My lord, was he that strong before?
He certainly looks like he's larger...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's better than becoming weaker.
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Well, yes, that's true.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But it seems awfully unnatural.
I wonder if he ate some strange herbs...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Do you suspect him of using drugs!?

 
**Benkei:**
Hahaha! Nice joke! I do nothing that would shame me before the Buddha.

 
**Benkei:**
I had some delicious tea at the teahouse, though.

 
**Mash:**
Tea...you say? On this island?

 
**Benkei:**
Yes. I think it's just before the next gate. There is a teahouse at the first settlement that I went to.

 
**Benkei:**
It was bright inside, and the customers weren't gloomy like the people in that settlement, but very lively.

 
**Benkei:**
How about we go there to gather information?
We might be able to hear some interesting news.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I like that. Let's go!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Come to think of it, Kojirou said something about that too...
 

 
**Fou:**
Foufou!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ooh! Taking a break at a rest stop during a trip is a real pleasure. I have no complaints about heading there first.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes. Actually, I'm thirsty too.

 
**Benkei:**
Oh, that's not good.

 
**Benkei:**
Come to think of it, the tea was so good that I had the teahouse fill my flask with it. Go ahead, have some.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, you're very kind. Thank you for this.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
(Glug glug) Hmm... This tea has a strange flavor...
It is definitely delicious, but...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Hiccup!

 
**Mash:**
Huh!? U-Ushiwakamaru? What's the matter?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What are you talking about, Mash.
There's nothing wrong with me at all.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Okay, now that we know where we're going, let's get moving. Ooh! Have a look at that, my lord.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
There is a jizo statue at the side of the road here.
It appears that some humans here still have faith.

 
**Mash:**
...It appeared as if her complexion was off, but...
She seems normal...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't think so... She's been standing there and staring at that jizo statue for a while now. What's going on...?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ah... My older brother!

 
**Mash:**
Huh!?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
This...this statue's face!
It looks just like my brother!

 
**Mash:**
A-Are you serious?
It just looks like an ordinary jizo to me...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yes. It's nothing more than a standard jizo.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
(...Nod nod)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That's because none of you know my brother! This smooth skin, this stone-like appearance, this special presence...and this expression!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
This is exactly what my brother's face looks like when he peers at me with those cold, dead eyes!

 
**Benkei:**
I guess if you say so, Lord Yoshitsune, then it must be true.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Well, who'd have thought I'd find such a fine gem in a place like this? ...It must be the work of a renowned stonemason or a monk.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But this is Onigashima. Who knows when some oni with no sense of worth might come along and crush it?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Then I must protect my dear brother.
You're coming with me. Up you go!

 
**Mash:**
Ushiwakamaru has tucked the jizo under her arm... She's picked it up and is walking off with it. I-Is that all right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, no, I don't think so, but there doesn't seem to be anyone around who might claim ownership of it...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, you know, Ushiwakamaru seems to have suddenly started saying and doing odd things, and her attitude has changed a little&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm? She appears normal, but something is odd about her... Didn't something like this happen before?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
And now unexpected enemies!
I'm ready for you!

 
**Mash:**
What? Enemies?
But how?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Isn't it obvious&ndash;?
So I can offer the heads of our enemies to him!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
With enemies appearing so soon after finding my brother, it means only one thing! My brother wants the enemy leader's head&mdash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
1, 2, 3&ndash; Look at them all!
Yes! The more, the merrier!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I will offer a mountain of freshly taken oni heads dripping with blood to my brother, and he will praise me!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
He'll say, “Again, Yoshitsune? Well done. Now get back to the battlefield before Masako comes in here shouting!”

 
**Mash:**
Master! Ushiwakamaru is making a fatal error!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Whatever she does with the heads, we're still doing this. Time for another round of oni extermination! Bring it oooooon!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That's the last one. You're quite fast, but still no match for me!

 
**Oni:**
Guaaaargh!

 
**Mash:**
Watch out! It's a counterattack!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
This is no attack! Hah!

 
**Mash:**
Look at that! She dodged with such swiftness...

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Something is rolling around at Ushiwakamaru's feet...

 
**Mash:**
Ah!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, it was bound to happen with her bouncing around and fighting like that. There must have been quite an impact on the jizo she was carrying too...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ah! ...My brother's head has come off!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Why you...! How dare you do that to my brother!

 
**Oni:**
Skreeee!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unacceptable!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My brother's head... Where is it?
...There it is! S-Stop!

 
**Mash:**
The jizo's head is rolling away at an incredible speed.
It's like a rice ball rolling along...

 
**Mash:**
And ahead of it there's&ndash;Uh-oh!

 
**Mash:**
That's a...Japanese traditional man-made agricultural fertilizer production facility&ndash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
You mean a cesspit.

 
**Benkei:**
And it's fallen in.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Poor Jizo... Well, these things do happen, you know... Jizo or not, even he can't save himself now...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Mash:**
I can't blame her for standing there in shock... Oh.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
All right. Shall we be going, my lord?
We still have a long way to go. (Toss)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(The body&ndash;She threw it away!)

 
**Mash:**
Uhm, excuse me. What about that&ndash;?
You're going to leave your brother behind?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hahaha! What are you talking about, Mash?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My perfect brother would never go to the toilet.
Which means that head was not my brother's.

 
**Mash:**
Sigh... Ushiwakamaru has really deified her brother, hasn't she?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
All right, let's go. The next gate shouldn't be that far.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Eh? Oh, it's all right.
My brother is everywhere anyway.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
When I look closely, my brother is in that rock surface, on that small stone, in the color of the sky. Heh heh... My brother is everywhere...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
My brother is in so many things that I could fill my hands with him... I am beside myself with joy...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just when I thought she'd returned to normal...
There's still something essentially wrong with her...

 
## Act 8: "The Second Great Oni Appears!"
 
**Mash:**
The location of the second gate should be right here...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. Be careful, everyone. I suspected this would happen, but I'm detecting a Servant.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes, and just like you expected, here I am☆ The beautiful woman waiting at the second gate is me&mdash;

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's your dependable shrine maiden fox who has borrowed a smidge of the divine wine, the beautiful and tipsy Tamamo-no-Mae!

 
**Mash:**
Tamamo-no-Mae! What are you doing here!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey!? You're that fox from way back when, huh!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh! My, my, Kintoki!
What a delightful toy you're riding there.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
(Sigh) How nice it must be to be you. Whenever, wherever, you're always so straightforward and pure.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Rather than the niceties of the heart, you are satisfied with the enjoyment of the practical. Yes, yes! You are so admirable!

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What's gotten into her?

 
**Mash:**
She seems to be sulking...
She has a glazed look in her eyes.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Fox! What's going on here?
Have you sided with the oni?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, do you need to know?
Do you need an explanation?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
If you would, please.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
...I have a pretty good idea why already.
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
How fortunate for you. That would bring tears to this hot-headed, animal-ear-wearing, high-flying Tamamo.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...But if you've already figured it out, then I wish you'd have done something about it sooner!

 

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I... I have...been waiting here forever.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I've been thinking how unfair it is that Nero is so lucky!
I want a grand stage made just for me, too!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...What?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Onigashima! It's Onigashima! This Japanese-style stage! Onigashima means Momotarou. And when you think of Momotarou, how can you forget his three companions...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But then, why?
W-H-Y&ndash;!!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Why am I not in the role of the dog!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Look at these! What do you think these ears are for, huh? Do you understand!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Is there anyone more suitable than me to play the part of the dog? If there is, then let them come forward!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Uh...my lord. To be perfectly honest, I'm feeling some pretty dreadful pressure here.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That glint in her eyes, it's just like an oni! That's the look of an oni god! The same type as Masako-sama!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
“They've probably just forgotten, that must be it.” I kept lying to myself, but of course, no matter how long I waited, the offer never came.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I just couldn't put up with it any longer.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That's when I thought I would just go to Onigashima myself, and force my way onto the stage.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But, that is where a heroine's self-respect comes in.
Yes, I do have pride.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I couldn't exactly do it sober, so I got hammered with some wine from some teahouse.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I let myself go and decided to stand in your way. Since you wanted to know, that's what's going on here☆

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As usual, you're only faithful to your own lusts, you animal! If you want to play, then do it somewhere else!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Buzz off! Mine is a problem that a leading character like you, Kintoki, wouldn't understand. I've got a poem for people like you.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Don't assume that you / Will always have a part to play / As Master's Servant!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So let's fight. Who wants to battle me for the dog role?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Despite how I look, I'm a real carnivore...
I'm a savage honey badger.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That attitude that makes you disregard me while you proceed with the story&ndash; I'll straighten it out right now!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
“Despite how you look”? Huh... Don't you mean
“No matter how you look at it”?

 
**Mash:**
Don't do it, Kotarou! Tamamo may not seem like it, but she is easily hurt and easily angered!

 
**Mash:**
The rule in dealing with her is to not comment on anything you think is odd with her!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
My, my, Mash! You certainly are frank. Even though we're both the maidenly type, I won't stand for it☆

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Come on, let's do a raid! A raid!
This blue oni is named Wazahamimaru.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
He is the embodiment of technique, and I have established myself as someone who pleases the one she loves with a number of techniques.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Cheap tricks won't work on us!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Cheap tricks? Hah!
Don't underestimate my driving skills!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No matter the track, it's crazy adaptable, you'll never even see my tail light! Off course? Hah! No way! My driving is golden!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Come on, Fox! Let's match our techniques!
I'll blow you right off the track!

 
## Act 9: "Wazahamimaru Repelled!" [Decisive Battle]
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
(Sobs) All I wanted... was a chance to have a role in this story...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
All I wanted was a new Noble Phantasm, a new skill, a new Craft Essence, and a new costume... That's all...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's way too much!
That's practically everything, Fox!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Tamamo-no-Mae. I understand your feelings.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Nevertheless, the role of the dog is mine this time.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You are older than my lord... so rather than the faithful dog, you're more suited to the role of the mother waiting for him to return&mdash;

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Lalala I can't hear you!
I can't hear anything about age!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Wait, I hear something...
Is this a revelation from heaven!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
“Who told you Onigashima will be the end? As long as you don't give up, there will be more Japanese-themed events...”

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Seriously... I won't hold my breath but...
I will be waiting... (Thump)

 
**Mash:**
Well, at any rate...we won.
That was really something.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That was something crazy!
She was totally nuts this time.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...She said...something about wine. I guess...that's what you call drowning your own sorrows?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Wine... Wine, huh?
Could it be...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm? What is it, Kintoki?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how alcohol isn't allowed when I'm riding Bear.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh! That's very admirable!
So you do obey the rules!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's not admirable. It's only natural.
I'm a hero to children, you know.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Only drink when you're an adult, and have a designated driver when you do.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The machines that us Riders travel on are all monsters, even if they're not Bear.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Us bikers, we won't stand for anyone causing trouble for other people because of their carelessness.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ohh... Waging a war against drunk driving, eh...

 
**Mash:**
That's an incredibly magnificent educational statement.

 
**Mash:**
All right&ndash;I feel sorry for Tamamo, but now we've got the key that the blue oni held.

 
**Mash:**
We've gotten past this gate now.
Let's keep moving at this pace!

 
## Act 10: "Of Alcohol and Oni"
 
**Benkei:**
The teahouse I told you about isn't much farther.
I'm really looking forward to this.

 
**Mash:**
This settlement is about the same size as the one earlier...but something seems different...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...I hate to say it, but I don't have a choice.
The difference is the smell.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Yes. The further we proceed, the stronger it gets.
It's the smell of alcohol.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This sense of déjà vu... Oh well, I mean, since we've come this far, we'd better check it out.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Most likely, up ahead is&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hello! Welcome! Welcome!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
We accept both humans and oni.
If you're thirsty, then please come this way.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Come on, Ibaraki.
Get out here and try to attract customers too.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ugh, why do I have to get all friendly with humans? I mean, really, Shuten. Do we really have to do this kind of thing&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh? I am out here working like this and you still plan to be lazy?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's just so lonely...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ugh... Fine!

 
**Oni:**
Hmm, excuse me. I heard that if I came here, I could drink some delicious wine&ndash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ugh&ndash;Gahahaha! Welcome, you lesser oni!

 
This here is superior, delicious wine that'll make even your soul drunk!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Be grateful and drink up!
(Shove) You'll cry tears of blood!

 
**Oni:**
Gulp! Guff! Glug, glug, glug... !!!
Woooheeee! Hehheheh! Another!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I can't believe it's really them!
Man, I saw this from hundreds of miles away!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hey there, kid! You finally made it, huh?
You're later than I expected.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
UGH! Sakata Kintoki, and the humans from that time!
It's you lot again!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Thanks for Rashomon.
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What do you mean “thanks”!?
Since when did we become friends!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You seem...shorter.
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Huh? Hmpf...It's, you know... I'm tired right now, and I'm on break. That's why.

 

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Damn, this really threw me off.
Either way, I shall not have a change of heart.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You bastards are still my enemies.
&mdash;Especially when that guy is around.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah? The feeling is mutual, Ibaraki. You want to take another shot at me, huh? To finish what we started?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Who is it that can make Kintoki talk like that...
Fujimaru, just who is that oni?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, he...I mean, she is Ibaraki-Douji.
The one next to her is Shuten-Douji.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not that long ago we were involved in something together. We spent several days battling at Rashomon in Kyoto.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I can't believe this.
She's the rumored Great Oni of Mt. Ooe...

 
**Benkei:**
Hm! Is that so?
It seems that my training is lacking.

 
**Benkei:**
I was convinced they were merely friendly and gracious teahouse girls that served delicious tea!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So that's who the mountain pass serving girls were, old man? You said they were total babes, so I was totally expecting&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;Who were you expecting?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Nobody! Just forget about it!
My clutch just slipped a little, that's all!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyway, back to the main issue, Ibaraki and Shuten! What the heck are you plotting by building this island?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&mdash;Huh?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;I knew it.
It's just like I told you, Ibaraki.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&mdash;Hah. Haha! Gahahahaha!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Foolish, you are such a fool, Kintoki! We are your greatest enemies! Why would we answer your&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's right! We're not going to tell you aaaanything.
I mean, we have nothing to do with this island.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You have nothing to do with it?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Well, it does seem that way...
 

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Sh-Shuten!
Why would you go ahead and tell them that!?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
They'd figure it out soon enough. It's not that important. (Sigh) You still don't know how to push people's buttons do you, Ibaraki?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ah! Ugh...B-But we're enemies... and even if you talk about buttons, I don't know anything about sewing...

 
**Mash:**
Don't you worry about it, Ibaraki-Douji.

 
**Mash:**
I think when Shuten-Douji talks about pushing people's buttons, she's also including you.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Y-You think so?
...You know, for a human, you don't smell half bad. There's no nastiness in you.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...So you must be Mash. That's a nice name. Sounds like what an oni would call their wine in Japanese.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Anyway, it's like Shuten said.
We didn't even notice when this island was made.

 
**Mash:**
So you're really not involved with it at all? So the oni on this island are from a different clan than you?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Clan? ...Yeah, they're from a different clan.
It looks like the oni here are from somewhere else.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I don't know who's behind this, but it's a disgrace to us if someone can build an island like this overnight.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ibaraki and I got really angry about it.
We came here to sightsee, and crush the place.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
We can't be having this botched Onigashima, these oni, or humans hanging around. We came to this island to turn it upside down!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Then why are you running a teahouse?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufufu. If we're going to do it, we may as well have fun. Just coming in to smash and kill is so... unrefined.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Especially when we're up against these ugly oni. We want to have fun and put an end to this with elegance.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That's right. So for our first step, Shuten and myself sneaked into the island's treasure room.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Stealing treasures is what oni do. When it comes to lock picking and sneaking, I'm better than any oni around.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
When we were in there, we found an interesting cup.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
To try it out, I poured some wine in and drank it, and it tasted familiar&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I had a realization and understood how this all started. I knew it wouldn't be good for just us to go crushing this island.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That's right. After taking a drink she said
“Why don't we wait for Kintoki to join us?” of all things.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Would you shut up, Ibaraki? Anyways, since we had some good wine, naturally we had to have a banquet.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's why we're out here serving wine.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I don't know what it's like further up, but now there's a spell on all the oni and humans from here on down.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Wahaha! Did you catch her grandiose plan? Fear her! Prostrate yourself! Cry in despair!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, no, that wasn't all that frightening...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But there are several things that bother me about what you said. You poured wine into a cup? It tasted familiar? Could it be&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
If it isn't the spineless Onmyouji.
Fufu, yes, it's just as you predicted.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
This is the same kind of “wish granting” cup from back in Rashomon. But it's not as powerful as it was back then.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What did you say!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
True... There isn't any mist like back in Rashomon. So I guess it doesn't have the power to make anybody in the surrounding area drunk anymore.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's right. But... If you directly drink the liquor, it might have some effect.

 
**Benkei:**
In that case, the delicious tea I've had here was&ndash;

 
**Benkei:**
Argh... I can't believe you've tricked me into breaking my vow of abstinence! I suppose it's fortunate that it had little effect on me!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Then that means what was in Benkei's flask was also... No wonder it tasted so funny.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But it seems that I did not act oddly from the effects of the alcohol! It must be because I am a genius!

 
**Mash:**
Hmm... Benkei's appearance...
And how she acted with that jizo statue...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, let's forget about what happened.
Talking about it won't do anybody any good.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
So then... What shall we do, boy?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
About what?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're still as dense as ever.
Or are you just acting stupid?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I'm suggesting we work together.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
What!?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
There's no need to act so surprised.
We just want to eliminate the oni on this island.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And you too want to do something about the mastermind who created this island, do you not?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Thanks to this cup, we still owe you for what happened before. I am sure our interests won't cause a conflict...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I suppose so. Based on what she said, the mastermind behind Onigashima and the incident at Rashomon...

 
**Mash:**
These two events are most definitely connected somehow. What should we do, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I think it's fine.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hold on. Sorry, but I can't agree with that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Well...
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
With these two, you're right to be suspicious, Boss.

 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
These two are oni. Just because they are the enemy of this island's oni, that doesn't make them our friends.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's not a matter of whether we can trust them or not. Nothing good will come out of oni being together with humans.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...It's different when humans betray each other. Humans are like... you know... They reason things out before a betrayal.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oni are different. They will betray you without any reasons. They slit your throat and take your treasure while you sleep. To them it's like breathing.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
They'll even go as far as destroying something they consider dear if it suits them.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...That's what an oni is. Oni are the kind of monsters you don't want to sympathize with.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Are you saying you want to put a collar on me? Fufu. Boy, you have unexpectedly abnormal taste...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Don't be stupid! Even with a collar on you, I wouldn't feel at ease!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ohhh... Then how about the other way 'round?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It might be nice if we put you in a collar, boy.
That way we can have a nice, peaceful alliance.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Then we could walk, fight, eat, drink together, and pick your bones all we want. Yes, that's a possibility. Let's do that.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Gah hah! I thought you were joking when you said you wanted to cooperate with these guys&ndash;But in this case...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Killing the oni on this island will sure make us hungry. This way, we can chew on these guys' bones while we're at it!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ugh... Such fearsome aura!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
So these are the great oni of Mt. Ooe...
Ibaraki-Douji and Shuten-Douji...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, this I like! It's easy to understand! We won't work with you, but we can't leave you alone either!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Your tour of Onigashima ends here, Shuten! I'll see you oni in hell, because that's where I'm sending you!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Ugh...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I cannot believe the power they have with those bodies!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ohh, how charming. I wonder... why am I feeling more excitable than a usual murder spree...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Perhaps it's because of the Master? I sure want to know the feeling of being commanded by this [♂ boy /♀ girl].

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hah! You drunkard, are you jealous!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You were all talk earlier, now what? Thinking about switching sides? Sure you're an oni, but I might reconsider if there's a Master with you!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's because you'll be under the binding of Command Spells! You wouldn't be able to do jack about it!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Naturally, with your twisted personality, Boss here probably wouldn't even trust you with anything!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hey! You watch out!
How dare you interfere with my business!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Or are you just jealous?
If that's it, then perhaps it isn't so bad.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Don't you worry, I won't forget about it either, boy.
I will take everything you give to me as well...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ooh! This is fun! So much fun!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I love this kind of deep, deep tangling of the flesh with handsome men...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's like partaking of beautiful wine from the heavens.
It's so intoxicating that I could become addicted to it forever...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Gya hah hah! What's wrong, warrior?
Your legs are wobbling like an infant's!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Tch...

 
**Benkei:**
Stand back, Lord Yoshitsune!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What? No, I'm still able...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Heh heh! Gah hah hah! I know it. I know it well.
Your swordsmanship and smell.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You're&mdash;a Minamoto!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...So what if I am, oni?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Keh keh, keh keh keh, keh keh keh keh keh! Oh, I see! Now this is getting interesting, Shuten!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We have business with the entire Minamoto clan...
Not just Sakata Kintoki over there!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
This is a good chance for payback. Can you block my attacks with that meager physique of yours!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh-oh! She's going to use her Noble Phantasm!

 
**Mash:**
Ushiwakamaru is so exhausted that she doesn't have her usual agility!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Can you dodge ten straight blows from my blazing fist? At the count of ten, you'll be nothing but bone&mdash; The Great Flame of Mt. Ooe!

 
**Benkei:**
Lord Yoshitsune, forgive me!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Ah!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
How loyal! But I am just getting started!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
One, two, three, four, five&ndash;!

 
**Benkei:**
Ugh! Oof! Gah!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Benkei! What are you doing!? Withdraw!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I can still fight! There's no need to stand tall in front of me to protect me!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Six, seven, eight...

 
**Benkei:**
Ugh! Ah! Namo...!

 
**Mash:**
Master! If this keeps up, Benkei will...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Benkei... You... You&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You foooooool!

 
**Mash:**
!!?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes, that's right! You're a fool!
What will you accomplish by dying here?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Your wish is to make the renowned name of Musashibou yours forever&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But I know that doesn't mean for you to die as Benkei!

 
**Benkei:**
...Ugh!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
This is the end&ndash; Nine, ten!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...

 
**Benkei:**
...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Tch, I miscalculated.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I thought they'd go running off at the end, so I split the flame in two. Thanks to that, it lost power.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
If I'd left the last flame whole, at least one of them would have been burned to a crisp.

 
**Mash:**
Amazing... Ushiwakamaru jumped up on Benkei's shoulders, spun around like a top...

 
**Mash:**
...split Ibaraki-Douji's flame in two, and dispersed it!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Secret technique... Wandering Tales of Shana-oh, Fifth Act Gaiden, Sudarśana Icicle Drill...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Do not underestimate me, you thieving oni. This is not the first time that I have crossed to the island of oni.

 
**Benkei:**
Ooh... Lord Yoshitsune... You've used one of your precious secret techniques on someone like me&mdash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Not really. If you had fallen, I would have been incinerated next.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
To be honest, I wanted to use it in a tough spot to save my lord so I would get complimented... but there's always a next time.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
More importantly, Benkei! It's been bothering me for a while now, but you stink of alcohol! Go wash that smell off, you fool!

 
**Benkei:**
Ooh... OOOOHHHHHHH!
Yes, you're right, my lord!

 
**Benkei:**
There's no better way to get rid of alcohol than exercise! I shall work so much even the oni will fear me!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes. That aside, you, come behind the temple later. I'll pay you back for the beating you gave me during the subscription list episode.

 
**Benkei:**
Oooh! Your grudge is so deep! You've been holding a grudge a long time after all, Lord Yoshitsune!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ibaraki, you sure made quite a scene.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now... If I don't get serious myself, it won't be balanced...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Bring it on! I've just finished warming up my engine.
I'll take you all down at top speed!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Let's do this, Boss! Step on it!
We will end this right here!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Leave it to me! Rev that engine!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Ready to overheat!
 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All right! I'm ready to blast off! Say your prayers, oni! Beg for the Buddha's mercy!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This golden lightning will blow you all the way to hell! It'll be more than enough to knock you sober!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ugh... Won't these guys ever give up!?
They were like this back at Rashomon, and now here...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Not only that, they've adapted to my movements! They're not powerful, but their tactics have gotten way too complex!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
This isn't looking good... We're being pushed back...
In that case, why don't I show my true nature?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You mustn't! I won't allow you to show your true nature in front of mere humans!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Rather than that, I shall become a great oni once again! Shuten, hand me that cup!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hmm... If you're going to go that far then I won't stop you. Here, take it...

 
**Mash:**
Master, it's that wine! If Ibaraki-Douji turns into the oni she was at Rashomon once more, then...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I won't let you! I'm splitting that cup in two, Ibaraki!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You can't reach it, you Ashigara monkey!
Did you think you were a match for me in agility?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Just you watch! This time I'll drink down double, nay, triple the wine!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
In the stories you humans made up, wasn't the leader of the Onigashima oni called Ura?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
He was a great oni that measured more than four meters tall! Just watch as I grow to that same stature&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ibaraki! Behind you! Duck!
Or your head'll fly!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&ndash;What did you say!?

 
**???:**
Oh dear... She dodged it.
That's too bad.

 
**Mash:**
Y-You're the one...from before!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It's you!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...I knew it. I thought it's about time for you to show up.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...I didn't think it was possible.
What the hell are you doing here, Boss Raikou!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Raikou... Wait, you mean Minamoto-no-Raikou!? The one whom Kintoki served under as one of the Four Heavenly Kings!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then... She's actually a really beautiful woman with an amazing body! Isn't that deviating from history way too much!?

 
**Mash:**
I understand how you feel, Doctor, but please keep quiet! You can talk about that later!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
That's naughty, Kintoki. Didn't I tell you before?
You should always watch your manners around others.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
And... “What the hell are you doing here.” How rude is that? It's almost like you're treating me as a nuisance.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...If...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
If that's really how you think about your mother...
I am going to cry, you know?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Mother?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I don't think it's nice to make your mother cry!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Another troubling statement!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can hardly believe the most powerful Mystic Slayer of the Heian era, the most renowned demon-killer in all of Japan, is a woman...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...On top of that, what did she just say?
Kintoki, what's her relationship with you!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Of course she's not my real mother.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But it's true that I'm indebted to her for taking me in and raising me&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is what Boss Raikou was like from the beginning. She said, “I will support you as a mother rather than an older sister.”

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So, well, you see,

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I guess you could say she's like a stepmother to me, as well as my mentor...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh my! ...Calling me your stepmother...
I don't remember raising you to be like that...

 
**Mash:**
Hey, can't you see her eyes are filled with tears? Come on, Kintoki, don't you think you should say something to her?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, you're not really a nuisance! Actually, I am really happy to see you after so long, Boss Raikou!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
My, Kintoki, you sure know how to make your mother happy.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Fufufu, I am happy too. Seeing you healthy and energetic fills my heart with joy.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
&mdash;Really, if there weren't any annoying insects flying around you, I'd be even happier.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Aren't you the same as ever, Raikou. Children don't like it when their mothers can't let them go, you know?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But that's about as far as your suffering will last.
It's about time for you to go...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Shuten!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
I have no intention of exchanging words with an insect. Begone! Begone this instant!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
&ndash;Let the slaying begin!

 
**Mash:**
I-It's started!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We have no choice but to join in!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Don't worry, I can promise you she's powerful. She's more powerful than a hundred, a thousand&ndash; Nah, ten thousand troops!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
So she's Raikou... Then that explains her swordsmanship.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
To think I'd be able to fight alongside not just Kintoki, but Raikou as well!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
As another Minamoto, I cannot let myself be shamed.
To battle, Ushiwakamaru!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Not good, this is getting too rough...
I played a little too much.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ibaraki, time to run.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Guh... You say that like it's no big deal, Shuten!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You can't do it? Then we'll just give up. I just thought maybe my dear Ibaraki would be able to do something about this situation...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I-I-I-I didn't say that!
There's no way I would disappoint you!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
With my skills, I can get us out of any predicament with ease! Grab on to me, Shuten!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ah, thank you kindly.
I knew I could count on you, Ibaraki.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Flattery will get you nowhere.
...I didn't stay stop, though.

 
**Mash:**
Goodness, what a tremendous leap!
They withdrew from the battlefield in an instant!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
If even a single insect remains, they will breed without limit. I will go and crush them.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
What about you...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I doubt we can catch up with them...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Sorry, but we have other things that we must do.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Just like the boss said, Boss Raikou...
I guess I can't call you both that, huh?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Using “boss” for both of you is just lame. It's a bit old-fashioned now, but can I call you Lord Raikou instead?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...That makes me sad, but I guess it can't be helped.
To be honest, I really wanted you to call me “mother”...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We'll talk about this later! We have more important things to take care of than those two!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...I guess I have no choice. Then, my Kintoki, will you give your mother your support as I chase after them alone?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My support? Well, yeah... Huh? What the!?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Then I will take your support&ndash;as my power source. (Nuzzle)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
D-Don't be hugging me here, Boss! They're watching me! And quit rubbing my head too! Hey!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Quit squirming. Are you that rebellious now? ...Ahh, now I see. You're worried about what your other boss will think.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyone would be embarrassed at this!
This isn't Parents' Day!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And aren't you forgetting something, Lord Raikou? Those two are getting away the longer you're like this!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh, that's right. It is sad to part, but I must be going.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
&ndash;Until we meet again, everyone.
Please take care of my Kintoki.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Sigh. I can't believe this.
Even Boss Raikou has been called out to battle...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Wait, if I've become a Heroic Spirit, then there's no way that Lord Raikou wouldn't become one too...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
So...that's the kind of person she was.
Oh, wait! I didn't mean that in a bad way!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
It's just that she's a little different than I imagined, and I said that because I was surprised...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, that's Boss Raikou, without a doubt.
That's her character, and that's the kind of person she is.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...And all of ya forget about what she did to me just now. You didn't see a thing. Understand?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just now? Oh, when she hugged you and rubbed your head...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Say that again!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nope, I didn't see a thing. Not a thing.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Same here... Of course I didn't see anything.
All I saw was the dauntless Kintoki fighting bravely.

 
**Mash:**
Shuten-Douji and Ibaraki-Douji&ndash;
We cannot forget that those two are here on Onigashima.

 
**Mash:**
We have orders to find out who the mastermind is that created this island.

 
**Mash:**
We'll keep those two at the back of our minds while we continue to move ahead with what we must do, Master.

 
## Act 11: "The Third Great Oni Appears!"
 
**Mash:**
...This is the last gate.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And of course, I detect a Servant here.
Who is that over there&ndash;

 
**Kiyohime:**
Red... the color of passion.
The color of an everburning flame.

 
**Mash:**
Kiyohime... Why are you here?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Why? Such a silly question.
I&ndash;

 
**Kiyohime:**
I will always appear wherever you, Fujimaru... No, wherever Anchin is.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I mean&mdash;I yearn for my Anchin, follow him everywhere, and corner him. I am his faithful, loving dog!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's not a faithful dog! That's called a hunting dog!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...She smells of alcohol.
I believe she too has had her fill at that teahouse...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A serpent drunk on her passions...
Now this is a true Berserker.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes. But from what she just said, I understand why Kiyohime is here.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes, that's right, Fou. As to be expected, she is like an assassin in pursuit of the role of the dog!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh, like an assassin... If she wanted the pheasant role, I'd be more than happy to relinquish it...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As a dragon, she's not gonna care about being the pheasant or the monkey.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Of course I don't. I have no interest in being a feeble pheasant or a vulgar monkey.

 
**Kiyohime:**
They say dogs are honest. I hate lies more than anyone, so the role of the dog is a perfect fit for me!

 
**Kiyohime:**
But still, ohh&ndash; How could a woman other than I be Anchin's dog?

 
**Kiyohime:**
I bet every night this bitch whimpers like a dog, barking “Woof, woof!” and being rewarded with rubs...

 
**Kiyohime:**
I bet that's the kind of play that you've been having!
I cannot forgive such shamelessness!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Just thinking about it makes the flames of jealousy spew from my lips!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You are mistaken, Kiyohime!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
It is true that I have taken the role of the dog, but we have not done a single shameless thing.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
The only rewards that my lord gives me are a good stroke for a job well done.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That's all!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hiss&mdash;!?
Then it's precisely as I thought it was&mdash;!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Go for her head! Headpats, nothing more!
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, yes. Apologies, that was not as intended.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I stroke Fou's fur as well!
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 

 
**Kiyohime:**
...I knew it. I must use force to take back my Anchin, and my place as Anchin's dog!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Come forth, Gorikimaru!

 
**Kiyohime:**
This red oni is the embodiment of strength. I hate lies, so I'm just going to tell you. There is no way you can defeat it with strength.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Prepare yourself, Fujimaru.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I will thrash you until you are no longer able to call anyone other than me your dog!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Damn, I'm not sure it's my place to say this, Boss, but do you have some special talent for getting in trouble with women?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyway, not to worry. You've got sumo champion Kintoki by your side! Bear too!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm ready for a match of strength! Whether it's a snake or an oni, I'll gladly step into the same ring with them!

 
## Act 12: "Gorikimaru Repelled!" [Decisive Battle]
 
**Kiyohime:**
Aaah!
How vexing...

 
**Kiyohime:**
But this rough handling&ndash;
It's made me feel like I'm being treated with such wanton passion. I'm so happy...

 
**Mash:**
You have to hand it to Kiyohime... Like a Berserker, she has a conspicuously unreasonable sense of victory.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I got quite the impression of Kiyohime...
that she had such intense feelings.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
The role of Momotarou's companions, the oni exterminators of Onigashima, cannot be taken up with half measures.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I feel that she has taught me how important a role it is.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I shall make a pledge! I, Ushiwakamaru, feeding on the passion of Kiyohime, shall embrace it...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
and fight gallantly as my lord's rabid dog until the very end!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's catching it. She's catching it too.
Please, no further, all right?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
At any rate... We have obtained the red oni's key.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yes. Now the final gate is fully open as well.
There's no stopping Bear now!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Now to burst through the goal tape at the summit&ndash;and come face to face with the mastermind of Onigashima!

 
## Act 13: "And What of Momotarou"
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Finally, we've arrived!
This is the summit of Onigashima!

 
**Mash:**
A wonderful view as you would expect from the summit... But this place is overflowing with a really sinister air.

 
**Benkei:**
The weather is getting worse as well.
That's a ominous black cloud there. Namo...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Now this is more like Onigashima.
So finally we can face the one behind all this.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Precisely. This is the climax of my lord's oni extermination. It's almost time for the conclusion.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Uh! Look, everyone.
Over there...!

 
**Mash:**
In the center of that open space, something...

 
**Benkei:**
...What a sinister cup. Hmm?
The one standing in front it is&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
That is Raikou. I thought she went after Shuten-Douji.
I wonder if she has finished them off...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Raikou, what in the world are you...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Hold on.

 
**Mash:**
Kintoki?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Don't get too close.
They're different.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...Ahaha. Kintoki, you're finally here.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
&ndash;Tch! Now I see. I should have know this was the case if Shuten was here.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Thinking 'bout it, I knew that selfish oni wouldn't show up here for something as trivial as fighting over a territory.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The only opponent she couldn't ignore would be a true standout of an oni.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You&ndash; Why?
Why have you returned!?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Hehe, hehehe, hehehehehehehe! You can tell?
So is that the power of love!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wha...

 
**Mash:**
Th-This evil presence...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Raikou... What are you?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...That's not Raikou. She might look the same, but her existence is completely twisted.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Isn't that right, boss of all demons?
Suzugamori's Ushi Gozen!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Hehe. Raikou and I are not so different.
You should know that, no?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No, you're wrong. You lost and were sealed away.
By your own hand, even.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ushi Gozen!? I've heard of that name before.
If I remember correctly, Ushi Gozen is Minamoto-no-Raikou's brother&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A cursed child born from prayers to Gozu Tenno.
The story goes that ultimately Raikou eliminated him&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, that's the story. Ushi Gozen here is something similar to Lord Raikou's older brother.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But Gozen is the title for a woman.
You should be able to figure the rest from that.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Lord Raikou has never talked about her origins.
Even I had to do a little digging myself.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I will tell you the truth. A child was born as the child of the god Tenjin. Her power was feared so much that she was seen as a cursed child, and thus sent to a temple.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If only that was where it all ended. That child's father... Well, he probably had some regrets.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
He regretted letting go of her talents. It's predictable what would happen. He welcomed his imprisoned daughter back as his newborn son.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You all know the rest of the story. Minamoto-no-Raikou lived up to her father's expectation, and became a warrior who protected Kyoto.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You mean Ushi Gozen and Raikou weren't siblings, but one and the same person!? But there is a tale that Raikou exterminated Ushi Gozen!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Right. That is actually true.
I know because I was there.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Just a moment ago you said...she had been sealed away.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yes, when she became the leader of the Minamoto family, Boss Raikou tried to cut away that deranged side of her.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, after a lot of trouble, it ended with her sealing Ushi Gozen deep inside of herself.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Tch. That's enough.
I can't believe I let you see a lame side of me.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's Boss Raikou's story, and you ought to hear it straight from her. I shouldn't be yammering about it.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What needs to be handled now is right here. Why?
Why are you here? You should've been sealed away.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
You want to know why your mother is here?
Easy. To declare “I am here.”

 
**Mash:**
...You're the one who made this Onigashima, aren't you?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Eh!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Yes. I, the one who acquired that cup, made it.
I made it to build a kingdom entirely for oni.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I said that you'd need Authority like that of the gods who created this island nation, but... Now I see, if you had the power granted to the incarnation of Gozu Tenno then...

 
**Benkei:**
A kingdom of oni? That doesn't sound peaceful at all. Why would you create a demonic kingdom like that?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
...Hmmm, you want a reason? Well...
Umm... Oh, how about this?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
What if I said it is to be a place where the uncelebrated ones, like myself, can take back their rights?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Even though we have lived here since ancient times, oni and spider-yokai alike are exterminated because of their strange appearance.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Raikou somehow thought that this was terribly cruel.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
For that reason, she decided to create this demonic kingdom... Does that sound believable enough?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But Raikou exterminated all the oni on this island. Including Ibaraki-Douji and Shuten-Douji.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Yes, well, that's because both Raikou and I hate oni.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
They're a workforce to create this demonic kingdom, but if I see them, I kill them. Humans are worth keeping around as food, but...

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Oni, you see, are only ugly and have no value at all.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Are you saying that your own subordinates are worthless? Even though they follow you and work for you?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Of course they're worthless. After all, all the oni on this island are nothing more than my own creation.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
The ones that I happened to draw well I dubbed Onimaru, the rest are just disgusting scribbles.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
It's difficult to observe your own incompetence. As soon as this island is completed, I plan on destroying them all completely.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So that's what they are...
Damn, I completely forgot about them.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I knew that I'd seen them somewhere before... They were the drawings of oni that Lord Raikou drew for me when I was a kid...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Then what about Ibaraki-Douji and Shuten-Douji?
I know they aren't oni you made, but...

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Oh, Shuten-Douji... That was just an insect.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
An evil insect that tried to get close to my dear boy. It's only natural I would crush them, stomp them, and then kill them, right?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
By the way, I beheaded Ibaraki just a moment ago, and cut open Shuten's belly. That felt good.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tch...

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
What do you think, Kintoki?
This island is really quite something, isn't it?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
You and I both are the whims of gods and men.
It's been difficult living in the human world, right?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
But here on this island you need not worry about the eyes of anyone. I really didn't want to have to go to all this trouble, but...

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
If I had turned Honshu into a demon land without thinking, then I'm sure you would have come to despise me, Kintoki.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
One must do everything they can to protect their child's playground.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
There's not much I can do about what happens on Honshu, but the least I can do is intoxicate these evil insects with evil wine so they kill each other off.

 
**Mash:**
So you're the culprit of the Rashomon incident!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...A Heroic Spirit that creates a fake Singularity with their own desire... No, as Ushi Gozen, you're just an evil spirit.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is a disaster of the same class as a Demon God Pillar! Kintoki! I hate to say this, but&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...No, I should be the one apologizing, Doc.
Both these times are my responsibility.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Kintoki? Why are you so hostile toward your mother?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
I told you that I built this island for you, didn't I?

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
To tell the truth, ever since the main castle keep was built, I've wanted to brag, but I can only keep this a secret so long.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
O Four Heavenly Kings! My limbs, my armor, my pawns. Do not worry, the time has come for you all to return to your lord's place.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Kintoki...
Your mother, that&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I know. Sorry I got you worried, Kotarou, but I'll handle this. It doesn't change what I gotta do.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Isn't that right, Boss?
This is the climax of the oni extermination!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Kintoki&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You, Ushi Gozen! I know well that you and Lord Raikou are pretty much the same.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Minamoto-no-Raikou's great feats are thanks to you, and Ushi Gozen's wicked deeds are Minamoto-no-Raikou's sins.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...And I got a huge debt to you that I can never repay. You raised me, so you've got my respect.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
However... Let me say this one thing&ndash;
You're not needed anymore!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
What... What did you say?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I mean that I'm not afraid of you in the least! When Boss Raikou gets seriously angry, that's a million times more frightening!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What are you talking about, making this island for me? It's nothing more than a place for a loner like you to hide.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Even if Raikou grew horns and became an ox god, she'd never really run from anything!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Minamoto-no-Raikou would cry, lose her nerve and throw a tantrum, but she would eventually get it together and make Kyoto her home!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're nothing but a loser cow, an oni that's eating dirt! Hurry up and bring back Raikou!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
...All right then. I understand the image of Raikou that you hold inside yourself.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
I thought you would understand me, since you are a fellow demigod. But if you cannot be convinced, then you are nothing more than a human.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Normally I would overlook such a thing... but I know that you won't allow me to just go.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
To protect the human world means that you will only allow humans to rule it.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
I can't tell which one of us is the oni anymore.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
You have reached the conclusion that wiping out everyone is the only solution too, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey! Now you've said it, you fiend.
All right, Ushi Gozen.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm gonna thrash you good!
But don't get the wrong idea.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's not because I am the oni-slaying Kintarou, nor is it because I am Momotarou&ndash;Boss's comrade.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As a son, I must stop my mother's crazy nonsense.
Don't be mistaken about that.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Ah!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
...Ah, ahhh... Dear me, this is no good... Even though I am your mother. Ohhh... Deep inside me... I feel so hot... So hot!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, Kintoki!
That truly is&ndash;love!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
With that, I can get serious! The reason being that I can completely accept your feelings&ndash;

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
&ndash;and therefore love you...to death!

 
**Mash:**
Uh!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Here it comes!
An opponent that I can't defeat if I hold back.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My lightning is Golden&mdash; But Boss Raikou's lightning is the pitch black threads from the Naraka hells!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'll need to finish this before I'm burned to a crisp.
I'm counting on you, Boss Momotarou!

 
## Final Act: "Ushi Gozen's True Form" [Decisive Battle]
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ugh... She's so powerful!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
She has to be. She wouldn't be fit to lead the Minamoto clan if she wasn't!

 
**Benkei:**
But I never expected her to be this strong!
She's truly a terrifying demon!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(I can't find an opening to break through!
That woman's been storing up her strength this long!?)

 
**Mash:**
Master, if it keeps up like this...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
There must be something we can do... Something!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
If only we could find some kind of opening!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
You've held up well so far, but... the end is nigh.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Feel free to invoke the Somin Shorai charm if you like. It won't save you, just like praying to the Buddha wouldn't.

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
All right, time to finish you all off.
Here is your&ndash;

 
**???:**
Fufu, fufufu.
I guess you got so drunk that you forgot, Raikou!

 
**???:**
Stubborn like insects, you say. The kind of insects that feed on carcasses&ndash; That's what we oni are!

 
**???:**
And when it comes to being an oni, none'll stand as tall as me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Take that!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Ugh!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Shuten-Douji!

 
**Mash:**
It's Shuten-Douji! She must have been hiding, waiting for her chance. But what about the mortal wound that she took&ndash;!

 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Ugh... How long are you going to be&ndash; an eyesore!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ahh... This really is...too much.
Oni don't die, but... disappearing...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Heheh! See you again, kid. Next time it'll be somewhere your meddling mother isn't&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Damn! Damn it all to hell!
...You're an oni! You're an enemy!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But... That damn oni pride of yours created this opening. I wouldn't be able to call myself a man if I let that go to waste.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Fine&mdash; I'll see you again in hell, ya drunk ogre.
We'll finish this off with a bang!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Let's do this! This is the home stretch! Come on, Boss! This will be our last Golden Drive!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Ushi Gozen:**
Kin...toki... Why?

 
**Mash:**
W-We did it...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
The evil aura is...disappearing.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Did...we...win?

 
**Benkei:**
Namo...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...This is a good thing, right?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm afraid we may have caused a lot of pain...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Yes, of course.
Heh, you're a good boss!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But you don't have to worry.
After all, I've already done this once before.

 
**Mash:**
...Kintoki? Then what you're saying is, to eliminate Ushi Gozen, we just need to...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, you just need to knock her out.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ushi Gozen and Boss Raikou are the same person.
It's impossible to separate them from the start.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So, a long time ago, I&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I stepped into the fight between Boss Raikou and the part she wanted to cut off, Ushi Gozen.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...I floored Raikou with a blow when she was trying to kill herself. I told her to stop being a dumbass.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I even got on my knees, wept, and begged her to stop.
The situation back then was much worse, but...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
In the end, it was Ushi Gozen that gave in. She jumped in front of my lightning strike and got knocked out.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Like, literally out. That Ushi Gozen side never came back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...But what about this time? Raikou might wake up and still be Ushi Gozen, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I know. We can only wait and see what happens. Anyway, this isn't something like the luck of the draw or a random bet.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ushi Gozen comes out when Minamoto-no-Raikou builds up too much divine energy inside.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You saw how much energy she released, right? Going crazy like that would make even Gozu Tenno tap out...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Ohhh... Wh-Where...
Where am I?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
See. Not a single trace of oni left.
Hey, Boss. Wake up.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
My, if it isn't Kintoki! It's been a long time.
How are you doing?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A long time?
Kintoki, don't tell me she's...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(She doesn't remember anything about being Ushi Gozen! Not a word of this to her! It'll throw her into a deep blue funk!)

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...Oh dear. It seems as if I've caused you some trouble...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Kintoki...and everyone gathered here... Though I don't remember, it is clear what the situation is from the looks of things.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...My weakness and my wretched nature have surely caused harm to everyone.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
I know this cannot be excused by just apologizing, but I beg of you, please forgive me.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
...Lift up your head, Lord Raikou!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
A Japanese warrior such as myself will be left struck dumb if you do something like this! Breathe, I must breathe!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
My, what a cute outfit you have on.
Might you...also be a Minamoto?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes. Though for certain reasons I go by my childhood name, I am a relation of yours, Lord Raikou.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Well then... How fortunate I am to have my madness subdued by a warrior of the Minamoto family.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
...I feel nothing but shame... As your ancestor, I should be a more shining example to you...

 
**Benkei:**
No, no. Don't say such a thing. Even if you were taken with madness, I have the deepest respect for your valor, Lord Raikou.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I-I agree... The elegant way you carry yourself, your formal way of sitting that gives off a glowing aura...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I believe we all see that the Raikou from before is different from the one now...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh, everyone... You are so kind to one such as myself...
I can see that Kintoki has been blessed with good friends.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's overflowing with motherly love... I can even sense it through the screen, so much so that it makes me sit up straight, you could say...

 
**Mash:**
Yes... I wouldn't know myself, but this must be what it feels like to have a mother around...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I know. I guess you'd call it magnanimity.
Lord Raikou's ability to give comfort is incredible.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No matter how rowdy the person is, they will sit properly and listen to her talk... Well, she's like a Bodhisattva.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. So this is Minamoto-no-Raikou's true nature. It wasn't the power of a warrior that bound the Four Heavenly Kings, but the power of peace!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(No, that was definitely the power of a warrior.)

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Dear me... I am not worthy to be called a mother.
I'm terribly sorry, Kintoki.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Don't apologize to me. I'm simply the monkey in this tale. The one in the lead role this time is the boss here.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh, so you must be the Momotarou! And your name... You say it's Fujimaru?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Thank you so much for taking on this much danger for another person... I really am terribly sorry for what happened.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
No trouble at all. It could happen to anyone.
 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
My... It could happen to anyone?
The same thing Kintoki said to me that day&mdash;

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
You must be very kind, as well as strong. Oh, Fujimaru... Fufu. I did get your name right, yes?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Give me a hug and I'll forgive you.
 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
A hug? You must mean an embrace. Of course.
I don't mind at all.

 
**Mash:**
Master? You're kidding, right? Aren't you?

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 

 
**Mash:**
Ah...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Well, it seems that my role here is done.
But I will never forget what you've done.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
I, Minamoto-no-Raikou, as the head of the Minamoto family, and as a warrior, promise to repay the debt that I owe you.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
The next time we meet, I shall be your sword.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Feel free to use me as one of your Servants.
I shall obey your orders, no matter what they may be.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Okay, then how about a hug...

 
**Mash:**
Master!?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Fufu. Of course. I don't mind.
I'll hug you like a mother anytime you want.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
I promise to embrace you.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
She left. As another Minamoto, there are so many things that I wanted to talk about.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...Not like she'd ever spend time with a country bumpkin such as myself anyway...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hmm? No need to worry about that.
You see, Lord Raikou actually is kinder to country folk.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're a Minamoto, plus you're tiny. The next time you meet, she'll spend all the time you want together.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Really? That makes me so happy!

 
**Benkei:**
(...Still, I feel she would have the same sweet smile as she drew her sword if she thought you were an insect buzzing around Kintoki...)

 
**Benkei:**
(I shall pray that I am mistaken. Namo...)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, how nice, a hug...
Oh, Kotarou, you too!?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
An oni-related Heroic Spirit drawn to Onigashima...
I suppose I fall into that category.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
How to deal with the monster within...
I think I now know the answer. Well, part of it, at least.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...I know I wasn't a whole lot of help...
but thank you very much, Fujimaru.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I too would like to lend you a hand, so give me a shout.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Rather than working as a ninja in a world of warriors, it was more fun playing the role of the pheasant under you.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
You see, a bird is free. It's unfortunate that I couldn't shoot light beams from my beak, but still...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hold on! It's too soon for you to be going back home, ninja boy. I have one final thing I want to ask you.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You always took a real humble attitude toward me. Why did you do that? I don't ever remember deserving that.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
So, you really don't know, do you?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
My clan's village is located on Mt. Ashigara.
Growing up, I heard a lot of stories about you.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
The legendary Kintarou of Mt. Ashigara...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're a renowned wild child that did great deeds in his hometown, then went on to have a successful career...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Jeez! Why didn't you say that sooner!?
We're from the same mountain!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...I messed up... Had I known you were my kouhai,
I would've tried to act cooler...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But I'm glad to see that you've been raised strong! And your Noble Phantasm has one hell of an awesome name!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Thank you. It was an honor to fight alongside you.
Until we meet again.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, that settles this abnormality.
It won't be long before this Onigashima disappears.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nice work, everyone.

 
**Mash:**
All right, Senpai. Shall we return to Chaldea?
We're done with exterminating oni.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, that's right! I think it best that I make this one final announcement.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I promise you. This is it for the oni extermination stories.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;And they lived happily ever after. The end!

 
## Challenge: "The Neverending Tale"
 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Ummm, sorry to interrupt your “happily ever after” ending... May I borrow some time from you?

 
**Mash:**
Raikou! Um, weren't you just sent back!?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Actually... Foolish me, I forgot something here.
So as embarrassing as it is, I came back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, you came back from the Throne of Heroes!?
That isn't even self-summoning, it's self-manifestation!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Well, I hadn't actually made it all the way back, so the rest was fighting spirit. Like, “Eeeeyaaa”♡

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So you were able to hold out against a banishing with fighting spirit... Kintoki, what's going on with your mother?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Don't ask me, Doc.
I can't explain it.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
When Lord Raikou makes up her mind, she just manages to slip through the cracks.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Despite her looks, she's got ten times my spirit. When it comes to forcing her way through, she'll get through, no matter who's in her way.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
She follows her own rules! Whatever the other person's circumstances are, her own circumstances are absolute...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Like they say, an oni god can move mountains! When I think that I have inherited that blood... How promising!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Yes, indeed...
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yes! I too am devoting myself to being able to suddenly appear if you're in dire straits, even without being summoned, Master!

 
**Benkei:**
Y-Yes... Certainly, in that way, Yoshitsune and Raikou are similar.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Although your... bodies aren't...
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...I see... Master, you don't know me as an adult, do you?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Servants can't grow, so therefore don't age, but you never know. There may come a time when I do become my mature self.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Heh. Please look forward to that day, Master.

 
**Benkei:**
Uh? Oh, even if you do become mature, Yoshitsune, you will never match Raikou's majestic bosomAaaarrghh!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Forget waiting for a beating behind a temple!
We'll finish this in the shade of yonder rock, Benkei.

 
**Benkei:**
Aiieeee&mdash;!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...There is safety in silence...

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That aside, Raikou.
What is it that you forgot?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Actually... It's the three great oni that are left on this island.

 
**Mash:**
The great oni that were guarding the gate, right?
Senpai already disposed of them.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
No, those monsters are connected with this island.
As long as the island exists, they won't go away forever.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
The problem is... the more those great oni are defeated, the stronger they get.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Right about now, they're probably reviving from your slaying. And they may try to get off this island.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
They're evil oni and they've got their eye on total destruction.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
If Onigashima ceases to exist, they'll vanish for good, but if left ignored, they could do real harm.

 
**Mash:**
Wh-Why did you give them power like that!?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Actually... I wanted to please Kintoki...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
You know, with prey, the stronger, the better, right?
So, foolish me, I got a little carried away...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh... Holy shit...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
But listen, Kintoki isn't the only one here.
Fujimaru is here, too!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Aren't you entrusted with restoring humanity or something like that? Then why not put your skills to the test here?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Yes, yes, in fact, that's a great idea! Ah, despite the fact that I created them, there is no need to hold back.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
It will make a thousand... even ten thousand oni seem like millet served in a bowl.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Please enjoy slaying the great oni until Onigashima vanishes♡

**Fujimaru 1::**
What if we slack off?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
What if I said I just wanted to go home?
 

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh. In that case, I myself will become an oni. (Grin)

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Young people mustn't pick up the bad habit of laziness. Therefore, insolent children will be punished.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
This is hard on your mother, too... but naughty children require discipline.

**Fujimaru 1::**
A sweet voice delivers harsh words!

**Fujimaru 2::**
What's going on with Kintoki's mother!?
 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ah, sorry, Boss.
As I said, this is the kind of person Raikou is.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And if you refuse, she'll cry.
In public or wherever, she'll bawl her eyes out.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's more embarrassing for anybody standing next to her. So all you can do is obey.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Awful... Oh, Kintoki, you talk about your mother like that again... when I'm just thinking of all of you...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
There, you see? ...Sheesh, the fact that she doesn't mean any harm is what makes her hard to deal with.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, I guess we'll just have to resign ourselves to it!
Besides, it'll be fun putting Raikou in our debt!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Let's do this, Boss! We can have a chicken race to see which of us kicks more oni ass!
