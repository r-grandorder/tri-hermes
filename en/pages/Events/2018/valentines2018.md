# Chocolate Lady's Commotion

## Prologue: Chocolate Flavored Great Escape
 
&ndash;Sweet, melting, and bitter.
&ndash;I guess chocolate is the flavor of love.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Mas&ndash;

 
**Kiyohime:**
&ndash;ter 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Today is Valentine's Day, Master.
Kiyohime, unworthy me, has made chocolate.

 
**Kiyohime:**
To be precise, I “became” chocolate rather than made it.

 
**Kiyohime:**
If I can become a dragon by holding on to my feelings for a thousand years, becoming a chocolate is rather simple.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Come!
I will be the personification of that cheesy tagline!

 
**Kiyohime:**
I will melt in your mouth&ndash;
but definitely not...in...your...hand☆

 
**Kiyohime:**
By the way, if I transform my entire body in chocolate,
I would be roughly 240,000 calories♪

 
**Kiyohime:**
You can cut me into pieces and eat me up later if you want to.

Perhaps something like “The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind?”

**???:**
A nightmare so terrible you couldn't even remember, I see.

 
**???:**
But, if it's a nightmare that can even torture our Master,
I have no doubt its content is related to Ms. K.

 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
...That aside... Hello, my Master!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I, Shakespeare, the most renowned literary writer in the world, have come to destroy your golden slumber!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Why? You may ask.
No reason, I am simply here to wake you up.

From you? That's rare.
 
**Shakespeare:**
I am sure you'd think that way. After all, Lady Mash is the usually the one to wake you up.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Unfortunately, as you may be aware, she's battling with chocolate at the moment.

Where's Mash?
 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, well, have you forgotten, Master?

 
**Shakespeare:**
All of the female Servants, including her, are spending all their time on chocolate.

 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
Some of them... Like Lady Artemis, for example, is making the chocolate for their true love.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Lady Mata Hari, Lady Antoinette, and Lady Boudica seem to be making chocolate for everybody.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I guess you could call those types of chocolate, friendship chocolate.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Also, although it's only my own speculation, I have an eerie feeling about what they might get in return on White Day, except Lady Boudica.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I mean, the majority of male Servants probably never received a chocolate in their life, and glare at the world with eyes that look like the Tibetan Fox.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, there are also Servants who don't care much about this kind of occasion, but that's that.

 
**Shakespeare:**
“It (Jealousy) is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”

 
**Shakespeare:**
...That's the saying, no?

Would they be happy to get one from me?


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
Ohhh, Master's handmade chocolate!
That would make any Servant happy!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Servants are emotional entities. If they get chocolate from you, you can expect them to work extra hard.

 
**Shakespeare:**
In that case, let's go join the ladies and make some chocolate with them!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hmm, someone appears to be running around the halls.
I urge you to exercise care, Master.

They seem to have run into the simulator room.
Shall we pursue them?

Understood!

Well, well, Master! I shall be rooting for you, so please go finish this quickly!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Shakespeare:**
Hmm, that was some good exercise, wasn't it Master?
However, what is this Servant?

 
**Shakespeare:**
It looks like a Shadow Servant, but with a much paler color...

 
**Shakespeare:**
More than anything&ndash;

**C：???:**

**Mata Hari:**
A chocolate I said. I am not sure what happened but...

 
**Mata Hari:**
...the chocolate I melted in a bain-marie​ started to fuse together, took human form, and all of a sudden ran away.

 
**Mata Hari:**
It sure is mysterious, isn't it?
What should we do, Master?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh... Chocolate...
ran...away...you say!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
In other words, let's call the entities we've just met “Choco-Servants!”

 
**Mata Hari:**
Now what do I do... I put some a secret spell on it that allows it to turn into a jewel.

**Mata Hari:**
Hehehe, if you pour enough love into your chocolate,
it's only natural for it to do that.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Please be sure to remember that because it's very important, Master♪

 
**Shakespeare:**
This has turned into an extremely fascinating event, Master!

 
**Shakespeare:**
But please rest assured, Master.
I thought something like this might happen!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Prepare for the impossible!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I have called upon some Servants with unusual senses of smell to track down those chocolates.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Let's use their scarily keen senses of smell derived from their unpopulari... I mean jealousy, and take back those chocolates!

Hahahaha, you sure like to jest, Master!

 
**Shakespeare:**
...If I were behind this commotion, I would surely make the chocolate escape with more drama, more tragedy!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Therefore, I promise I am only acting out of the kindness in my heart.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah, I can see distrust in my Master's eyes. Heh heh, I guess my legacy can be both good and evil at times!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahhh, heaters and blankets are the best on a cold day like this... Good, it feels so good...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I know I have a lot to do, but snuggling in this blanket next to a heater somehow makes me feel like everything will be all right.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Truly, this just feels too good...
No wonder humanity has fallen...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Pardon me for interrupting your self-degenerating fantasy, but you really have to stop being useless when we need you.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ouch, that hurts! That brought me back to reality! Can you stop with the kind of insults that cuts you to the core?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, what? Shakespeare?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rayshift preparation?
Chocolate? Escape? Oh, hold on a moment.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, wait a minute. What's going on?
Eh, eh, eh&ndash;!?

B-Blackbeard?
 
**Shakespeare:**
Hahaha, don't worry, Master.

 
**Shakespeare:**
There's an example of someone who you think might be powerful, but he's actually just another sandbag for you to practice your new moves on.

 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
Either way, he's no threat to us.

 
**Blackbeard:**
What? I am! I am a serious threat!
By the way, what was that just now, Master?

 
**Blackbeard:**
I almost became some shining particles and disappeared along with some touching BGM!

 
**Blackbeard:**
ALL OF AMERICA WAS SHOOK!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Rest assured, Lord Blackbeard.

 
**Shakespeare:**
You are like a minor character who randomly dies off in the background during a touching scene in some war flick.

 
**Shakespeare:**
You are but a candle that will go out at any moment, so there's no time for BGM.

 
**Blackbeard:**
That's mean!

 
**Blackbeard:**
But, blowing someone up without warning!
I see you are fit to be a pirate!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Yes, it's only natural for a pirate to ambush someone!
But it pisses me off when it's done to me!

 
**Blackbeard:**
IT PISSES 
 
**Blackbeard:**
ME OFF 
 
**Blackbeard:**
!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Now that you have intentionally pissed me off,
you'll learn the extent of my wrath!

 
**Shakespeare:**
What are you saying, Lord Blackbeard?
That explosion was not by me or Master.

 
**Blackbeard:**
So then, who on Earth would dare to blow up Blackbeard?!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Don't tell me one of ya good-for-nothings is trying to kill me and take my spot!

 
**Underling:**
It's not us, Captain!
Also, no one could replace ya.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
That is correct, Lord Blackbeard!
How can you suspect us without proof?!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Y-You...are absolutely right.
I am sorry... Well, Mista Mephisto...

 
**Blackbeard:**
...Wait, hold on a minute.
Why are you riding on my boat?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Huh? Well you said “explode” out loud like that, so it's only fair for a explosive Servant like me blow you up, right?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I mean, even if you'd told me not to do it,
it's a clown's job to go ahead and do it anyway, no?

 
**Blackbeard:**
AARRGH! So you were the one!

 
**Shakespeare:**
By the way, Lord Blackbeard.
Are you hiding any chocolate?

 
**Shakespeare:**
You seem to give off a cacao-like smell.

 
**Blackbeard:**
Chocolate...you say?
N-No way, I have no idea what are you talking about!

 
**Blackbeard:**
I insist that I am innocent!

Shit! I have no rights, you say!
But, I haven't done anything&ndash;!

 
**Blackbeard:**
In that case, I can only prove my innocence through sheer strength! Brute force = Freedom! That's the way of the Voyager of the Storm!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, did someone mention a fight?
Then please allow me to participate, too.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
What? “Don't come?” “Don't do it?”
The more you say that to me the more I want to join!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Hee hee hee hee hee!
But, having Master as my opponent is so very painful!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
In any case, Valentine's Day is a day no normies should have! Especially in a Far East city called Harajuku!

While I, Blackbeard, am lucky to be summoned by Master, this is where our opinions differ.

 
**Blackbeard:**
And so, Mista Spartacus!
This Master here is a tyrant! An oppressor!

 
**Spartacus:**
Then I shall rebel against such tyranny.
Master, I will be the one to protect those chocolates!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Let me help too!
Other Servants, besides me, are strong, you know!

I was about to mold the Choco-Servants into Mash-chan,
Euryale-chan, Atalante-chan, Artemis-chan...

Anything you want to say?

**Emiya:**
Wait, hold on, Master.
I know how you feel, but please listen to me.

 
**Emiya:**
Due to my special nature, I am familiar with modern events such as Valentine's Day.

 
**Emiya:**
Therefore, shouldn't you view my actions as a way to remove any elements that might cause you trouble?

 
**Shakespeare:**
That's why they call you the most overprotective Servant in Chaldea. We understand your motives now, but can you share the details with us?

 
**Emiya:**
I object to that overprotective statement...
But fine, I'll ignore that for now.

 
**Emiya:**
Master. The people trying to send you chocolates are not normal humans.

 
**Emiya:**
That's right&ndash; They are Servants, heroes of the past! They are a group of people abnormal in all kinds of ways.

 
**Emiya:**
Capability, mentality, skill, and berserk level, they are the best in almost everything.

 
**Emiya:**
There's no way they would simply make some chocolate, send it to you, and just end it there.

 
**Emiya:**
I am certain. Something bad will happen to you.
Without a doubt, it'll be GG for you!

 
**Emiya:**
To stop my Master from walking into a minefield, it's obviously my duty as a Servant&mdash;

 
**Emiya:**
No, my duty as a friend who has a heart. I understand the consequences greatly. I had lady issues, too!

 
**Shakespeare:**
As I thought, you're an overprotective Servant.

 
**Emiya:**
Hmm. My words alone are not enough to convince you?
I thought as much, so I brought over a special guest.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hmm, a guest, you say? A guest who has gone through multiple lady troubles... That can only be...

 
**Diarmuid:**
Chocolate is dangerous, Master!

**Diarmuid:**
That's very good!

 
**Diarmuid:**
I didn't think too much and accepted some chocolate during a certain Holy Grail War! Then an intense confrontation unfolded right in front of me!

 
**Diarmuid:**
I could have stopped it if it was just a fistfight.

 
**Diarmuid:**
But there's no way I could stop two people from stabbing each other with words while smiling.

 
**Diarmuid:**

Chocolate is dangerous, Master.
It will mislead people!

Well, meditate on the wisdom of pioneers like this and be patient.

 
**Emiya:**
Master. Don't forget that the future of mankind depends on you.

...Oh boy. It seems we can't convince you.
In that case, we will stop you with brute force.

 
**Emiya:**
Kill one to save a hundred&mdash; I hate that idea,
but I will believe it to be the absolute justice in this case!

That's right, unknown Archer!
For an Archer Class we sure do think alike!

Master! Even if I, Diarmuid, must point my blade at the one I serve&ndash;

**Shakespeare:**
If Lord Emiya feels like it, he can effortlessly make a chocolate.

 
**Shakespeare:**
In the event that Master does not receive chocolate from anyone... Since Master would look bad if that happened...

 
**Shakespeare:**
He was going to say “You might not want one from your guardian, but here” and then give you a chocolate.

 
**Shakespeare:**
That was the kind of beautiful ending he was going for.

 
**Emiya:**
The feeling of not receiving anything,
I... I understand that feeling all too well...

 
**Emiya:**
I made this chocolate using leftover ingredients, but I thought it would be better than nothing...

Well, there is a possibility that Altera will show up, but right now she's busy making chocolate...

That's right, the mastermind!

 
**Caesar:**
You see, even without relying on someone great like me, I'm sure you can tell there's a Servant that appeared recently...

 
**Caesar:**
...that will make you think “Can't we just blame everything on this guy?”

 
**Shakespeare:**
...Ah yes. That guy.

 
**Shakespeare:**
The kind that would make you say “It's for the best...” with a sorrowful expression.

 
**Shakespeare:**
That one that feels like “That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.”

Now go, go chase that person down!
I am going to stay here and enjoy more cocoa.

**Emiya:**
A Servant's physique doesn't change, you know...

 
**Emiya:**
Even if by some skill you may change your physique,
this amount of exercise won't do a thing.

 
**Emiya:**
A healthy diet can be adopted only after leading a regimented life, getting proper exercise, and appropriate food.

 
**Emiya:**
...Hmm, now that we're at it.
Let me fix that unhealthy body of yours.

 
**Caesar:**
Er, hold on.
Why are you grabbing my hand?

 
**Emiya:**
Fuyuki Citizens' Marathon Flame Course,

Boom! Did you just say “Boom?” Just how forceful can you be? I don't even have time to comment!

But, please wait! Physical labor does not fit my image...
Oh, I can feel the burn! My fat is burning!

Please be careful, Master.
Mages are like an author's deadline.

&ndash;Wait, wait a minute.
Please listen to me first.

 
**Paracelsus:**
What is chocolate anyway, Master?
That's right, it's a snack made from cocoa beans.

 
**Paracelsus:**
With its abundant sugar, chocolate is sweet and the calories and fat are also overpowering.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...Currently, there are countless female Servants in Chaldea.

 
**Paracelsus:**
They give away chocolates, and if Master eats all of them, it wouldn't be good for Master's health.

 
**Paracelsus:**
However, simply destroying the chocolates won't do&ndash;
They will simply make more on the spot.

Besides, if I do that, they'll kill me.

I'm playing with fire here!
 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
I see you're motivated now, Master!
Yes. It always comes down to violence.

 
**Shakespeare:**
It's sad but inevitable. Just like water always flows to lower ground, and birds always fly towards the sky.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Yes. Inevitability.
Every part of a bad ending is created by inevitability.

 
**Shakespeare:**
If things stay the same, not only will Master, but even the little girl here will face a bad ending.

**Shakespeare:**
Heh heh, I will tell you everything when the battle is over. Let's save everyone, Master!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Ugh, so you want to fight!
What a bad person... Fine! I don't care anymore.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Master and the uncle who only writes difficult stories, you will all be the Decapitating Bunny's prey!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's mean, so mean!
Flicking my forehead actually hurts!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Now this is the end.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
FINE! But I am still not giving you the Choco-Servants!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Heh, heh, now I, Shakespeare shall tell you the cruel reality!

 
**Shakespeare:**
You know, little girl.
Tea parties are fun.

 
**Shakespeare:**
If you have them together with sugar-packed tea, sugar-packed pastries, and sugar-packed chocolate...

 
**Shakespeare:**
It will envelope you in a sweet sugary joyfulness.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Unfortunately&ndash;we must not be allowed to enjoy this forever.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Even if the most beautiful time of the year can be kept,
there's a price to pay for enjoying anything for eternity.

 
**Shakespeare:**
“When sorrows come, they come not in single spies, but in battalions.” That's just how it is.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Wh-What do you mean?
Stop saying stuff that I can't understa... Ouch!

 
**Shakespeare:**
&ndash;That's right. As the price to pay for all those sweet pastries and tea, you'll&mdash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
...get cavities.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Nooooo!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I hear that cavities hurt like hell before dental technology was established!

 
**Shakespeare:**
It's painful. It hurts!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
H-H-Hell... No way, that's terrible.
B-But you know? I am a Servant!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Why yes. If you'd been eating normal candy, there's no way you'd get cavities...

 
**Shakespeare:**
However, what if a Servant has been eating candy made from another Servant's power? What do you think will happen then?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I-It's just your imagination. My tooth doesn't hurt at all.
It doesn't tingle at all, it doesn't sting at all.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tea doesn't stain my teeth when I drink it!

**Shakespeare:**
Time for the finishing blow!
Summon Chaldea's number one dentist!

Eh, eh, eh!?

YEAH!

Huh!?

**Fergus:**
So, where's my patient?
Ohhh, is this adorable young lady my patient?

 
**Fergus:**
Come, open your mouth wide...

 
**Fergus:**
Raise your hand if it hurts, OK?
(Doesn't say it won't hurt.)

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Eeeeeeeek.
That smile looks so scary!

 
**Fergus:**
Relax, young lady. With this Caladbog, AKA dental drill, any cavities will be...

 
**Fergus:**
SMASHED IN ONE SHOT!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Nooo&mdash;!
Help, Tooth Fairy&mdash;!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Phew, it's fixed now.
You can go home, Lord Fergus.

 
**Fergus:**
Hmm. I feel guilty about threatening an innocent girl, but I can't let bad things go.

 
**Fergus:**
I will happily take on the part of the villain if my Great Spin of Heaven and Earth can be useful, HAH, HAH, HAH!

 
**Shakespeare:**
See, I prevented a bad ending, right?

But the girl seems pretty traumatized.


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
I was bluffing about 50% of the time, but it seemed to work out after all!

 
**Shakespeare:**
After this, we will have retrieved most of the chocolates.

 
**Shakespeare:**
We're still short on some, but you can recover those at your leisure.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Now people can get back to making their chocolates.
I am sure the ladies (and some men) among the Servants will be happy.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Master can have an easy mind now and receive those chocolates.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I can have an ease of mind now that I have the idea necessary for the manuscript of my Valentine Anthology.

**Shakespeare:**
Don't worry about it, Master!
Servants have to enjoy themselves even during off time.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Come now, you have no time to waste on someone like me.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Master... Numerous chocolates are waiting for you!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hehehe. Indeed this is&ndash;
“To be or not to be, that is the question.”

For I will put my whole heart and soul into this brown pastry. I hope it will be accepted.

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Now that I have completed my chocolate.
Without any trouble that is.

 
**Mash:**
...I am happy that Senpai is getting a lot of chocolates.
I am a little worried if mine will get acknowledged.

 
**Mash:**
Perhaps the wrapping was too plain?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you for the encouragement, Fou.
I will go hand it to Senpai now.

 
**Mash:**
I dropped a letter in the mail already, so Senpai should be there.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai?
Are you there, Senpai?

 
**Mash:**
...
...

 
**Mash:**
...Strange.
No response.

 
**Mash:**
...Let's look for the exit record first...
No exit record.

 
**Mash:**
In that case, could it be!
This is just like Christmas&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Since this is an emergency, HAH!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Mash:**
I'm charging in!
Back me up, Fou!

 
**Fou:**
FouFou!?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai... I mean, Master!
Are you okay?

 
**Mash:**
...Huh?
I am sure I entered Senpai's room, but...

 
**Stheno:**
Hehehe, welcome my dear.
I welcome your rough arrival, Mash.

 
**Euryale:**
Just as “I” planned, Demi-servant.
But, it's too bad.

 
**Euryale:**
We were supposed to have our “loser sister” punish you if you were even a minute late.

 
**Medusa:**
...I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart that you arrived right on time, Mash...

 
**Mash:**
Wh-what's the meaning of this?

 
**Stheno:**
I guess you don't know?
Valentine's Day is an important event for women&mdash;

 
**Stheno:**
The same goes for you.
So you wouldn't appreciate it if it's too simple, right?

 
**Stheno:**
A special event is necessary for a special day like this.That's why&mdash;

 
**Euryale:**
Right! That's why we will hype it up for everybody!

 
**Euryale:**
Only by giving the chocolate after overcoming several trials, can the bond between a Master and Servant get stronger.

 
**Euryale:**
I believe the term is Misattribution of Arousal?
It's very important to balance the tsun and dere.

 
**Medusa:**
Ah, yes... Of course, my big sisters.

 
**Medusa:**
And I am really sorry, Mash.
Those two are like that... I am sorry.

 
**Stheno/Euryale:**
I can hear you, you know? Medusa!
I can hear you, Medusa!

 
**Medusa:**
Sorry, I am sorry, my big sisters!

 
**Medusa:**
Well... Again I am sorry for all the trouble but, please defeat us and move onward!

 
**Mash:**
I see. That is how it is?
...Understood. I will accept this trial!

 
**Mash:**
A special trial befits a special occasion like this...
I accept the justification behind those words!

 
**Mash:**
And&mdash; Today is the only day I can express my gratitude to Senpai!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Stheno/Euryale:**
Nooo waaaay!

 
**Medusa:**
...What a powerful strike! An attack from the heart, 100 times more powerful than anything from my sisters!

 
**Medusa:**
We were totally defeated, Mash.
You did a really great job.

 
**Mash:**
Th-Thank you very much!
You hang in there too, Medusa!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
All right... Who's waiting for us at the next trial?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Mash:**
Yes. I prepared myself knowing in a situation like this, there will always be second and third trials!

 
**Mash:**
You know what happens twice will surely happen a third time!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Jack:**
Hey, it's Mash.

 
**Mash:**
J-Jack?

 
**Jack:**
It's a trial, please give me chocolate!

 
**Mash:**
Well, but this is...

 
**Jack:**
Please, please, please, please, please!
Please, please, please, please, please!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Mash:**
Fou is trembling at the intense begging...
Honestly, I'm scared too!

 
**Mash:**
But, there's no way I'm handing over this chocolate!
If you want one, go find the Doctor, Jack!

 
**Jack:**
Whaaat, that's mean.
In that case&mdash; Trick or Dead!

 
**Mash:**
That event was three months ago! You need to understand that the year has begun already, please!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jack:**
Waaahhh, that's mean, Mash!
We just wanted some candy!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
I'll give you something sweet later, ok?
So please let me through, Jack...

 
**Jack:**
Really? In that case, you passed!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
...Thank you.
As for the sweet, is sesame bun okay?

 
**Jack:**
Er... That's the kind of stuff you eat when you're old,
Yuck...

 
**Mash:**
...I feel like the Doctor just passed out from that comment, but maybe it's just my imagination.

 
**Fou:**
Fou Fou.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Kiyohime:**
&ndash;This is a trial!

 
**Mash:**
Ugh... I knew something was coming but... of course it's Kiyohime!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, it is I, Kiyohime, who comically throws flame at events that deal with love.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...Although I am really not that comical! Platonic love, seriousness, and suspense are what I was known for!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...
Fou...rror?

 
**Mash:**
Fou wanted to say “Aren't you missing horror there?”
But let's leave that aside.

 
**Mash:**
I will face your trial with everything I have.
Let's go&mdash;

 
**Kiyohime:**
Well, wait a little there, Mash.
...Mash, what do you think about our Master.

 
**Mash:**
I respect Senpai more than anyone!
I take pride in being their Servant!

 
**Kiyohime:**
...Not like that.
I mean be more straightforward.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...Don't you want to be bonded to that person with love and romance?

 
**Mash:**
?
What do you mean by that?

 
**Kiyohime:**
...I see. There are no lies in those words.
But that's that and this is this.

 
**Kiyohime:**
My flame will be the conclusion of this trial.
Prepare to receive it!

 
**Mash:**
Understood.
I will protect this chocolate!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Kiyohime:**
&ndash;Ohh, I lost.
Is the chocolate safe?

 
**Mash:**
Yes!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Onward then.
That person is waiting for you.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much, Kiyohime!

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, Senpai, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;!

 
**Mash:**
(Inhale... Exhale...)
...ahem, ahem.

 
**Mash:**
Good morning!
It's Valentine's Day, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Ah, well...sorry for shouting.
I don't quite understand my feelings...

 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway, I heard today is the day we transform our feelings of gratitude into chocolate and give them away.

 
**Mash:**
That's why, here you go. It's not much, but it would make me happy if it nourishes you.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Why am I armed, you ask?

 
**Mash:**
Well... Da Vinci taught me a lot of stuff beforehand, so...

 
**Mash:**
So I turned into my Servant form to psyche myself up for this...

 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway, thank you for the Valentine this year.

 
**Mash:**
I put all my heartfelt gratitude in this... I'm looking forward to our time together in the future, Master!
