# The Little Santa Alter - Christmas 2018

## 1st Night: What Ever Happened to Jeanne?
 
**Narration:**
The waves crashed and roared.
The violent winds howled.

 
**Narration:**
It may not have been alive, but for all its ferocity, it may as well have been.

 
**Narration:**
Somehow, it was as frightening as the beginning of the world, but as beautiful as the end of all things.

 
**Narration:**
A gift that, supposedly, was never meant to be, was being opened before my eyes.

 
**Narration:**
...In the end, I was probably a failure as Santa.

 
**Narration:**
That's why I'm sure these tears are tears of frustration.

 
**Narration:**
There was a hole in my heart.
And what filled it was&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, are you ready to go?
That reindeer outfit really suits you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks.
 
**Mash:**
Oh, you forgot something important.
Here, your red nose.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that a compliment?
 
**Mash:**
Yes! Of course!

 

 
**Mash:**
I have sort of a care package for you from all the Servants.

 
**Mash:**
We expect you to be out for a while, so please take it with you.

 
**Mash:**
First... This is a portable heater.

 
**Mash:**
You'll be flying at over 7,500 meters, so this will make sure you don't get cold.

 
**Mash:**
It's made with Medea's magecraft, so it will definitely keep you warm!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How helpful!

 
**Mash:**
And this is a lunch from Emiya.

 
**Mash:**
If you pull this string, it will automatically warm up.

 
**Mash:**
He developed it together with Edison, or so he said...

 
**Mash:**
Oh, the one flaw is that it emits a strong smell of dumplings, so be careful when you eat it.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rocket dumplings...

 
**Mash:**
And this is from Marie.

 
**Mash:**
“It's a little early for Christmas, but this is warm spiced wine,” she says.

 
**Mash:**
“I'll put it in an insulated case, so drink it when you find yourself getting cold.”

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is all so thoughtful...

 
**Mash:**
And lastly, Senpai, this is from Santa Alter and me.

 
**Mash:**
It's a talisman we made together. It's meant to give many effects, such as safe travelling...

 
**Mash:**
At least, I hope it does.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, and I have a message from Santa Alter.
“You'd better not make her cry,” she says.

 
**Mash:**
Hehehe, I guess Santa Alter is kind of worried.

 
**Mash:**
This year's Christmas is going to be a little bit... crazy...

 
**Mash:**
But I'm sure you'll make it work.

 
**Mash:**
I need to undergo emergency maintenance, so I'm staying here with the doctor...

 
**Mash:**
But I'll be monitoring you carefully!

 
**Mash:**
So um... If you would contact me too, that would make me happy.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger!

 
**Mash:**
Right! Goodbye, Master!
Be careful!

 
**???:**
All right, it's time for Reindeer Master to head out!
Let's go!

 
**???:**
It is pretty cold outside, but we'll be fine!

 
**???:**
Because I, Jeanne d'Arc Alter, am Santa!

 
**???:**
It's extremely logistical! I mean, logical!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay...what the actual hell?

 
**Mash:**
Um, let me start from the beginning&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Time for you to learn a lesson...

 
**Gilles:**
Oh, Jeanne! Why are you summoning me at this late hour?

 
**Gilles:**
If you wish to do a ritual of dark magecraft, can't it wait till morning?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
No, no, no. Definitely not.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I don't care about those weird rituals.
I don't even think they work.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You know... It's almost time, right?

 
**Gilles:**
Time for what?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
All the younger Servants are starting to get excited.
I mean, so are the adults.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Why are they getting all excited for? Can you even call that candy-loving book a legendary hero who left a mark on history?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Ugh... Those so-called “real Servants” are satisfied with merely existing, and not at all interested in bettering themselves.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
According to Master, someone once said that anyone without a desire to improve is an idiot.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I don't know who it was, but it's a great saying worthy of a Jeanne Alter gold star.

 
**Gilles:**
Haha, you're getting off track, Jeanne.
So, will you tell me what it's time for?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Ahem.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Basically, it's almost Christmas.
Doesn't it piss you off to see them in high spirits?

 
**Gilles:**
No, not at all.

 
**Gilles:**
On the contrary, when I see the children get excited, it makes me want to smile.

 
**Gilles:**
Though for reasons I can't quite understand, my smile seems to frighten children!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I see now what a stupid question that was.
Also, those kids are right to run away.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Anyways, listen.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
When Christmas comes, she starts getting excited.

 
**Gilles:**
Who is “she”?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Don't you know?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That awful, dark Santa with the skin the color of a corpse!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Last time I was just walking through the halls when I almost got blown away!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
“You aren't looking where you're going, fallen saint. Can't you tell I'm in the middle of tuning my Llamrei Mark II?”

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
“Of course you can! It's almost Christmas! It's almost time for Christmas fun. My sword shall save the world once more!”

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
She said it twice! She just wouldn't shut up!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And then she went into the combat simulator and started humming “Jingle Bells” while blasting off her Noble Phantasm for hours before finally going home.

 
**Gilles:**
(Is my Jeanne stalking Santa...?)

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Can't you see? She's much too merry to be a proper Santa.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So I'm going to steal&ndash;ahem, borrow&ndash;Santa Alter's sack.

 
**Gilles:**
What? The sack she uses to carry presents!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's right. And then I'm going to hand them out before she can.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The children will cry. Santa Alter will cry.
It will be my best Christmas ever!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Do you see now, the genius of my plan?

 
**Gilles:**
But, my Jeanne...

 
**Gilles:**
If I may point out, even if it is the middle of the night, she is still a Servant.

 
**Gilles:**
And we do not even have Presence Concealment.
Won't it be quite difficult to steal from her?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hmph. You underestimate me, Gilles!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Don't worry! The cute little kiddie King of Heroes gave me a potion that makes you invisible!

 
**Gilles:**
Ooh! So that the pitch-black potion you've been holding...!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Yep. I'll turn invisible, steal her sack, and then spend the whole night delivering presents! It's foolproof.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And tomorrow, when the children are happily opening their presents, I will feast on the sweet salt of Santa Alter's tears&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
SERVES YOU RIGHT!

 
**Gilles:**
What a beautiful, perfect plan!
So all you have to do is drink that potion, my Jeanne!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Yep! All that's left is to drink this potion, Gilles! That's...all...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
How strange. I'm suddenly a little...nervous for some reason...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It should be safe, right? I was careful not to ask the scary evil Gilgamesh and chose the dumb kid, as a precaution.

 
**Gilles:**
Yes! I have no reason to be confident about that, but I am willing to bet your life on it!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Gilles, feel free not to say everything that comes to mind.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But that's fine. If I stopped to worry about consequences, I wouldn't be a Servant.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am the witch of vengeance. Even if I've been tricked into taking poison, I'll still laugh and gulp it down.
All the potion. All of it.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Well, bottoms up!
(Swallow)

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Ugh! This tastes awful!

 
**Gilles:**
They say good medicine is bitter, Jeanne.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Right, right. So? Am I turning invisible?

 
**Gilles:**
No, not really.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Grr. I knew he tricked me. Well, then I'll just go STEAL the real thing from&mdash; Ack, gah!?

 
**Gilles:**
What's wrong, Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
M-my body is on fire...Gyaaaahh!

 
**Gilles:**
Oh no, not again! Jeanne! Jeanne!

 
**Gilles:**
JEEEAAANNE!!!

 
**???:**
Hey, you're being real loud, Mr. Gilles de Rais!

 
**Gilles:**
Huh?

 
**B：???:**
Hmph. Trying to turn invisible to stir up trouble.
The grown-up me is awful, huh?

 
**Gilles:**
Eh? Eh? Eh?

 
**B：???:**
But I respect her desire to want to be Santa!
I shall carry on her will!

 
**Gilles:**
Wait... Wait... Are you...!

 
**???:**
I am Jeanne Alter Lily.
I was born to become the next Santa!

 
**Gilles:**
Oh, Jeanne... Jeanne...!
You have turned into a child too adorable by far...!

 
**Gilles:**
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my! I'm so excited I seem to have ascended! Prelati would be delighted!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Anyway, the grown-up me is a dummy to think I could steal by turning invisible.

 
**Gilles:**
Oh? So you have a plan, sweet young Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
A plan? Mr. Gilles, are you stupid?
I don't need a plan!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm just gonna convince Miss Altria Santa that I'm the better Santa!

 
**Gilles:**
Ooh! Even in youth my Jeanne was so very reckless!

 
**Gilles:**
Nothing good will come of this, but she may at least learn a life lesson...!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...?
Off I go!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh, you stay here, Mr. Gilles de Rais. You sneaking into a woman's room at night is bad, bad, bad!

 
**Gilles:**
...

 
**Santa Alter:**
What'd'yuh mean you wannnabe Santa? ChristmasSwordOfPromised-calibur!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Huh? Did that voice sound younger or something&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
Meh, whatever. Bedtime... Zzz...
Get lots of sleep f' Christmas...

 
**Gilles:**
Ooh, Jeanne!

 
**Gilles:**
She's the sort who may bite if you get too close!
Well, she may bite whether you're close or not!

 
**Gilles:**
Perhaps the reason you failed was that you approached unguarded. Oh, how sad...!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Why didn't you tell me before!?
She was scary! She was really, really scary!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Nuh-uh, I'm not crying!

 
**Jeanne:**
Bulging-eyed Gilles... What is the meaning of your intrusion at this hour?

 
**Jeanne:**
The Servants are one thing, but Master and the staff are sleeping.

 
**Jeanne:**
If you want to make noise, do it when everyone is awake&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
The properly grown-up me! It's Regular Adult Me!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I see. That explains why Adult-Me is all panicking and stuff.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
But this year, Santa's job will be miiiiiine!

 
**Jeanne:**
...

 
**Jeanne:**
...Gilles?

 
**Gilles:**
Wh-what is it, Jeanne?

 
**Gilles:**
Is it just my imagination, or is your smile a little more strained than usual?

 
**Jeanne:**
How could it not be strained?
Now, tell me what's going on!

 
**Jeanne:**
If you don't tell me everything, I will poke those googly eyes right out!

 
**Jeanne:**
...And that's what happened.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What? Just... What?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You don't seem very calm, my Master.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
If you're my Master, you need to be composted and remain calm at all times!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see... So they multiplied again...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hey, Master. What's that attitude for!?

 
**Jeanne:**
That's right, Master.
Multiplying like bunnies is Altria's thing.

 
**Jeanne:**
Me multiplying is an exception to all exceptions!

 

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry. May I ask your name and class once more?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Of course. I am...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
“Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily Lancer!”

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
One more time, faster.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
F-faster? All right.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
“Jeanned'ArcSantaAlterLilySanta”!
Huh? Waaait a minute... Um...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
“SantaJeanneAlterd'ArcLily”!
No... Um...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
“ShantaJantaLilyncer”!
Huh Um... Hmm... Um... Well...

 
**Jeanne:**
Master, please don't tease her too much.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Tease me...? M-Master, what are you? A kid!?

 
**Mash:**
I think I see what's going on.

 
**Mash:**
Jeanne Alter has become Lily. And the cause is the young Gilgamesh's potion. Am I correct?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
I'm really sorry!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're not even kind of sorry, are you?
 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
Nope. She woke me up in the middle of the night.
Not my fault I grabbed the wrong potion!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
It wasn't deliberate. It was an innocent mistake.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Forgiven.
 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
Thanks!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
...Well, if I were to make an excuse, it was because I was woken up at night and I grabbed the wrong thing.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
Maybe I shouldn't have opened the door to my treasure vault while I was still lying on the floor.

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
That was very careless of you, Gil!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child):**
Hahaha. I never thought I'd see the day Jeanne Alter had a good reason to yell at me.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Adult-Me is a good-for-nothing!

 
**Jeanne:**
I&ndash;she is not that bad...

 
**Jeanne:**
Deep down, she has the potential to become a proud Servant...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
The way the other me spoils me is the reason why I think of things like trying to steal sacks!

 
**Santa Alter:**
...I see. So this is what that weirdo looked like before she grew up.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...

 
**Santa Alter:**
Miss Calls-Herself-a-Holy-Maiden, Master, come with me. I need to talk to you.

 
**Jeanne:**
I've never called myself anything like that!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Mash, you play with her for a while.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm too old to play.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
More importantly, Miss Altria Santa, give me Santa's sack&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
Just play. Or you get the naughtygirl-calibur.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Whaaaaaa!?

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Heh.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I-I don't think Santa should be threatening people! (Shaking)

 
**Mash:**
Should I call you Jeanne Alter Santa Lily?

 
**Mash:**
Or maybe something shorter? A nickname...?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Jeanne Alter is fine. Or Santa Jeanne.

 
**Mash:**
Then for now, I'll call you Jeanne Alter.
Why do you want to be Santa Claus?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Because I'd be the best Santa ever, duh!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I can do a much better job of delivering the proper, ideal presents for everyone.

 
**Mash:**
The proper presents...?

 
**Mash:**
I do remember Emiya's unreadable expression upon receiving Black Keys last year...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What's an Archer gonna do with Black Keys, anyway? That's why she's bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!

 
**Mash:**
...Good point.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I know most of what happened last Christmas from grown-up me's memories.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I know I can give better presents, and that everyone will love them!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Heh. Listen to you.

 
**Mash:**
Welcome back, Master. Is something wrong?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nothing.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm back.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Wh-what is it, Miss Altria Santa?
Is it another-calibur? Whatcha-calibur again?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
D-do it, if you dare!

 
**Santa Alter:**
You are not fooling anyone, talking tough while hiding behind Master.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...But we talked, and I've decided that you can be Santa this year.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Take this. This is Santa's secret sack.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Huh?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-it's okay? Really?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well, if you don't want to, I'll just be Santa again.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
N-no! I'll do it! I'll do it!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Reindeer, this year will be different than last.
You take the lead.

 
**Santa Alter:**
What you do is no different from last year. Gather the stockings that are the crystallizations of children's hearts.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Babysitting will be an extra task, but you can do it.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Th-that sounds like I'm just some useless kid!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Take that back! I demand a reduction!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I guess I have to babysit Master, then.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Fine. I'm gonna lead the Reindeer to the best Christmas ever!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do our best, Santa Claus.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Do our best? There's no need to work that hard.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hehehe. Why, you ask? Because my plan is perfect!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
(I have a bad feeling about this, but hang in there, Reindeer. Fujimaru is the only one who can control her.)

 
**Jeanne:**
Consider this a request from me as well, Master.
Please, make Lily into a great Santa...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm on it.
 
**Jeanne:**
Thank you...!

 
**Jeanne:**
I know this should be obvious, but Alter Lily is also a different being than myself.

 
**Jeanne:**
Please treat her as a full-fledged Servant.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll try.
 
**Santa Alter:**
Heh. That's the answer of one who knows what [♂ he /♀ she]'s doing.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
All right, I'll start by testing your power.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Santa, Jr., Fujimaru.
We'll start with Santa warm-ups.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Santa needs an iron will, an icy heart, and the fury of a demon! Fight without fear!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
To the combat simulator, right?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Don't worry. I'll show you my powers as a Santa Servant.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Very well. I will be your opponent, Santa, Jr.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
A-already!? Uuhhh...
Wait! I'm not ready&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
There's no use arguing! I shall test you to see if you're a Santa worthy of my Reindeer!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Santa Alter:**
You passed. Barely. But, I suppose I must give you my secret sack.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Now, Reindeer. Work hard so you don't tarnish the Santa name.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Th-that was scary... That was real scary...

 
**Mash:**
Are you okay? It looked like you were maybe crying a little, Jeanne Alter...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
No, I wasn't crying! There's no crying in Santa Claus!
It's a Class that delivers smiles!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Anyways, old Santa gave me her blessing.
Now let's go deliver preseeents!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh? It's still early?
What are you saying, Reindeer?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You know how the song goes!
“Santa baby, hurry down...”

 
**Mash:**
V-very well, but we have to prepare, so hold on a little bit!

 
**Mash:**
It may not be winter yet, but it is late fall. There might already be snow falling in some places.

 
**Mash:**
We should at least get some winter equipment ready!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Anyway, that's enough reminiscing.
Time to get going, Reindeer!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
There are Servants waiting for us to give them their presents!

 
## 2nd Night: The Gift of the Fool
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Have you heard of the story called
“The Gift of the Magi,” Reindeer?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Personally, the truly moving moment kinda falls flat!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hair can grow out, but the special family watch is gone forever!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
From the way the story goes, the husband prolly won't be getting a new watch.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
And every time the wife uses the combs, she'd feel real bad, and every time the husband see the combs, he'd feel kinda dumb.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
And that's bad. 'Course they wanted to be nice, but their gifts didn't make them magi, they made them dummies!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Yes, that's why this is the perfect present for her.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hum, hum, hum. Hum, hum, huuuum.
Hum, hum, hum... Hum, hummmm♪

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Slashing through the night, and tearing through the sky♪ This is how Santa should be!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You look like you're having fun.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Fun... N-no. This is work! It's real work!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Singing is part of Santa's job!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What a pretty voice.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Pretty...
Rei... Reindeer, you've sure got an eye for talent!

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
In any event, the first request will be... from Jea... Jean...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jing Ke.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I know that!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Last year's request was for a dagger with a sharp blade, but she instead got an “elegant older gentleman”...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What's an “elegant older gentleman”?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A classy old guy who got murderified.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I don't really get it, but that's not a good present for Jean Kay!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I have the bestest present for her, so let's head towards the caves!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
So, how do you get down there, anyways...?

 
**Martha:**
Again. We're doing this. Again. This year!?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
It's fine. It's fine. How about a drink, Martha?

 
**Martha:**
And this year Ushiwakamaru is drunk, too...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
No, no, no, no. I am not all at drunk.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Yooou...shall not pass.
(Talking to a Jizo statue)

 
**Martha:**
Stop talking nonsense.
We only need one person who talks like that.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Maaarrrthaaa!
Make me your Steel Fist Yukhoe, Yukhoe&mdash;!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Use your fists! Smash the meat! You know, the thing that magically tastes better that way!

 
**Martha:**
Okay. Fine. You two are a pain this year, too!

 
**Mata Hari:**
But Christmas is so much fun.
Why didn't you tell me last year?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Hey, Martha. Hey. Hey. Hey.

 
**Martha:**
It's just pains in the butt all over the place!
I thought this might happen!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Booooooo...

 
**Martha:**
Jing Ke! Do you have any other requests?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Hmm?

 
**Jing Ke:**
I have plenty of alcohol, so just Yukhoe will be fine! (Belch)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh, oh! Over here! Over here! I have a request.

 
**Martha:**
Sure, what is it?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I'd like a crockpot. Would that be okay?

 
**Martha:**
A crockpot?

 
**Mata Hari:**
What is a crockpot? Is it for crocodiles?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
No, I was hoping to make some soft-shell turtle soup.

 
**Martha:**
Oh, turtle soup...

 
**Jing Ke:**
Turtle soup, huh!?
That sounds good! That will invigorate you!

 
**Jing Ke:**
We can always make our Master eat it!
It'll be one wild night!

 
**Martha:**
Well unfortunately, I didn't procure any soft-shell turtles.

 
**Martha:**
Why would you need to be invigorated on such a holy day?

 
**Martha:**
Sure, I can see you celebrating a bit, but more than anything it is a time for reverence and&mdash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hahahahaha, what are you saying, Martha?
There's a huge turtle right here.

 
**Martha:**
 
That's Tarasque! Tarasque!!

 
**G：Tarasque:**
(You need to... pick better friends...)
↑Said while trembling like a soaked, frightened puppy 
 
**Mata Hari:**
Hey, Ushiwakamaru.
Don't you feel bad for Tarasque?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Besides, no way a turtle this big would taste good!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Hmm... Then how about giving it a try?!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Hahahahaha! Tarasque soup! Tarasque soup!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Do you see this, Reindeer?
Look at these weirdos...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is a terrifying scene...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
All the adults are ganging up on that poor turtle.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It's like a scene from hell.
This is bad... This is real, real bad.

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is so terrible in so many ways...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yeah, I feel bad for Tarasque, but seeing grown-ups acting like this...!

 

 
**Mash:**
Santa Alter told me what happened last year, but...
This is far worse than I heard...

 
**Martha:**
Oh, Santa and Reindeer.
You came again? So soon?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes! We're here! And just like last year you're all sooo baaad!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You're all getting ingrate... inebred... Drunk!
Drunk in a cave! And you call yourselves adults!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Come onnn! Are you dummies!?

 
**Martha:**
...Weren't you taller last year?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
H-hey! Don't pick on me!
I'm going to grow! I'm GONNA get taller!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Whaat? Santa?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Eek!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Oh, Santa's here again!
Come, come. Have a drink.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Jing Ke, Santa's scared and hiding. That's no good.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
We need to smoke her out. Like a mole.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
If you want to chop off the head of every soldier in a fortress, it's best to just burn it down.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
So, let's burn everything!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
R-Reindeer! Reindeer!?
Ushiwakamaru is scaring me!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
This is why I hate drunk people!
This isn't Christmas at all!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's punish them.
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Punishment... What a spirited idea...
I mean, splendid idea.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Brother would just put his trembling fingers up his brow in frustration...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But my sister-in-law, Masako. Wow, was she strict.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
If one didn't continuously demonstrate great martial might and feats of strength, she might take their head at any moment.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Punishment. That is good.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But if you don't give me a good punishment, I, Ushiwakamaru, shall bite back without hesitation!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's punch 'em till they straighten out.
 
**Martha:**
Let your fists do the talking... That sounds nice.
But we are an all-girls club.

 
**Martha:**
Out of respect for our friendship, I shall be on their side! Also, I'll make sure you forget everything while I'm at it, Master.

 
**Martha:**
It would be awkward next time we saw each other. Right?

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Ha. A fight? Yeah! I can do that!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Come on, Reindeer, give me your orders!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
When I win, make sure you praise me a lot!

 
**Mash:**
The sad drunk girls' party is coming this way!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
(Panting) W-we won!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You were great, Santa!
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes, I am the bestest Santa!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're cute.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Cu...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
N-N-NO! I'm not! I'm not!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You can praise me as much as you want, but for being the best Santa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
No calling me cute! No, no, no! Boo...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Thank you...

 

 
**Jing Ke:**
Oh man, we lost! It's lose even if you drunk while you're fun!

 
**Martha:**
(Sigh) That didn't sober them up at all...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Anyways, here's your presents, weird ladies!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Ahahahaha. What's this? (Gulp, gulp)

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Some sort of new alcohol? (Gulp, gulp)

 
**Mata Hari:**
This tastes funny... (Gulp, gulp)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It's a detoxifier.

 
**All Three:**
What.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Servants shouldn't be getting drunk!
That's bad, that's real bad.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
This medicine...is so you always keep your sense of duty as a Servant.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh, please do be careful. It also means if you drink any alcohol you'll take damage.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Th-that can't be!

 
**Jing Ke:**
I can't drink? Wh-what's the point in living now...?

 
**Martha:**
Darn it... I see. So that's where this was going...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Whew. Did you see how great the presents I gave them this year were?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Things were finally about to get really wild and fun...
It's going to be tough being sober on Christmas.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Oh my. I can't use alcohol as an excuse to do things anymore...

 
**Mata Hari:**
(Glance)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What's wrong, Reindeer?
Your face is all red...

 
**Mash:**
What's wrong, Master?
Did something happen, Master?

 
**Mash:**
Is there a reason to lock eyes with Mata Hari, Master!?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Hehehehe.

 
**Martha:**
Umm, Santa. You didn't make this medicine... Did you?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
No, I didn't know how, so I had a Caster make it. I don't know who he was but he wore white clothes&mdash;

 
**Jing Ke:**
Did he have long hair? It was long hair, wasn't it? Hahahahaha, let's go stab him. Stabbity stab stab!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I shall accompany you to the very gates of hell!
Haha, hahaha, hahahahaha...!

 
**Mata Hari:**
I think I'll come along, too.
Martha, you handle the rest.

 
**Martha:**
What do you mean, handle the rest&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Okay, let's head to the next one, Reindeer!
It smells like alcohol here, and it's making me dizzy...

 
**Martha:**
Okay, you. Wait juuust one second. (Grab)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Gah.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Wh-what is it?! I'm Santa! I'm busy!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You already got your present! Lemme go!

 
**Martha:**
I need to talk to you.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Call me Santa!

 
**Martha:**
Okay, okay. Santa, Santa.

 
**Martha:**
...Now. What were you thinking when you chose those presents?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What I was thinking... I wanted to pick something that would be good for them.

 
**Martha:**
Hmm... I think Christmas presents are more about making people happy than being practical.

 
**Martha:**
The celebration of Christmas began as an opportunity to celebrate His birth.

 
**Martha:**
It's not about having a good gift, but rather about making someone happy... Don't you think?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Nope!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
If Christmas is a day of blessing, then giving a useful gift is important.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...It's true everyone might not be happy with my gift, but...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
If it ends up being useful, then their happiness really isn't that important. That's what I think.

 
**Martha:**
...Hmm, I see. I suppose that way of thinking is&mdash;

 
**Martha:**
It makes sense, but...

 
**Martha:**
...Reindeer, can I leave the rest to you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, I got this.

 
**Martha:**
...Understood. That's all from me.
I thank you for your present.

 
**Martha:**
Good luck, Santa.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Haha, yesss!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Okay, let's go deliver our next present, Reindeer!

 
## 3rd Night: We are Middle Schoolers
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Okay, let's get going, Reindeer!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Time to deliver some good, practical presents for the good Servants of Japan!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Is it time yet?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Hmph, Lord Amakusa. What is Fuuma waiting for?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Ah... He requested a present from Santa Claus.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Hahaha! I see! I see!
Even the leader of the Fuuma Clan is still human, eh?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
I thought ninja were just puppets on strings without human emotions. Man, that's so cute!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
We Servants find our psychological ages strongly affected by our physical bodies.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
A 15 year-old body means his mind has regressed to that of a 15-year-old.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Indeed. Memories of our older selves often feel like it's somebody else's business.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Servants are such strange beings.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
But Lord Amakusa, is this “Santa Claus” really real? Handing out presents sounds like the work of a celestial maiden.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes, that's exactly right. But word from [♂ him /♀ her] is that there's a bit of a problem this year...

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Oh? A problem?
That sounds interesting. What is it&mdash;

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
They're here!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Thanks for waiting! You must be Fuuma Kotarou!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily has arrived!

 
**Mash:**
I see all the Servants of the Far East are gathered here... Are you having a banquet or something?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...A child?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm not a child! I'm Santa! Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily! Aww, how come everyone calls me a child?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Mostly because you are, I guess?
Come now, want some candy?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
No. Thank. You.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Besides, everyone knows you're not supposed to take things from strangers.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you want one?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer, where did you get that candy?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
A ramune flavored candy?
My faaavorite! Its fizziness is so grown-up!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
What do you mean, grown-up...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Want some candy?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What? Really!?
Thank yo&mdash; N-no, I'm fine.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I don't um... I really don't like mint... It's a little too grown-up for me...

 
**Mash:**
I see. Mint flavor is for grown-ups, huh?
I'll ask the doctor for some next time.

 

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
So, Santa. About my present... (Fidget, fidget)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes, I know. What you truly need is&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
This Japanese-English dictionary!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...A dictionary...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes! Your Noble Phantasm name has, um...
A lot of grammatical issues and things.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Fix it to proper English for a proper NP name!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Hmm, even I can tell that this is no fun at all.
A Japanese-English dictionary for Christmas?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
That's as disappointing as getting a biography of Schweitzer. No, I mean Schweitzer was a great man, but...

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Anyway, that's a terrible present.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What? Even Mr. Tawara is complaining!
This gift is for Mr. Fuuma's own good!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
But I've heard Christmas is a time for celebrations, like New Year's.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Everyone celebrates and everyone is happy. You want a gift like a festival prize, or something cheerful!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Which means it should be something they'll enjoy, not something that makes their life better, right?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...If it's not useful, then it's not a very good present.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Hmph.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Otherwise, giving a present is just about making yourself feel good. The giver just wants to take joy in giving something.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
That's no good! It doesn't make the world any better.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
So that means no matter what the person says, the giver has to get them a useful gift to help them improve!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
That's what it means to be Santa.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...No, it isn't.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes, it is.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
 
IT IS NOT!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
IS TOO!

 
**Both:**
 
Grrrr!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Hmph. Nothing for it, then.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
We are Servants. We shall settle this as Servants do, with a Christmas battle!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
By the way, I'm joining Fuuma's side.
It's childish to give someone a present they don't want.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Fine, then, be that way!
Santa will kick your butts!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I see. ...Then I shall resist with all I've got.
I am Fuuma Kotarou, fifth leader of the Fuuma Clan.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I shall destroy this most pointless of presents!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
My name is Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily! You're gonna take my gift and like it, whether you like it or not!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...Understood. Leave it to me.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
I lost to a kid like her!?
When did I get so rusty!?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
I guess I can't be touting “Playing is Justice” anymore... Maybe I should take it easy with the eating, too...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I've failed...!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
But a defeat is a defeat. I suppose I must now accept your Japanese-English dictionary.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Now you can fix your Noble Phantasm's name!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Hmm? I've no intention of changing its name.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What...?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...The founders of the Fuuma clan were “ijin.”
Which is to say, they were not from Japan.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I'm told my father was a large, red-haired, blue-eyed Westerner.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
For the founders, the fading memories of their homeland must have been hard to endure.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It is the same with the children born here. We can no longer speak the language of our forefathers.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
So the least we can do is to use a few (cool-sounding) words of that language to bring them peace...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Such sentiment is embedded in my Noble Phantasm...
So I can't change it.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I didn't know that... And to think I tried to give you a dictionary...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, no. I will take it, and thank you for it.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
In the future, maybe I'll add something to my Noble Phantasm name. So, thank you...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Okay. Let's go, Reindeer.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It's time to move on.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Huh, she left in the middle of our bit of reflection.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
That girl&mdash;

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Hmm?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
That girl doesn't feel any joy in giving presents, does she?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
No, she doesn't seem to. She's trying to do it right, but...it is sad, too.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
She focuses on usefulness because she doesn't know what kind of gifts bring joy.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
But then... Why did she become Santa in the first place?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Oh?

 
**Tawara Touta:**
What's wrong?

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No, I was just wondering...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Where did Lord Amakusa go?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Reindeer.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Umm... Am I doing this all wrong?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You look down.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Maybe my present for Fuuma Kotarou wasn't so useful after all...

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It's hard being Santa.
I thought it would be real easy when I started...

 
**???:**
Oh? Don't tell me you're giving up on being Santa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Who's there!?

 
**Mash:**
Huh? What? I'm detecting a Servant!

 
**???:**
Heheh. Only a fool would reveal his identity when asked.

 
**???:**
But I suppose there's no harm in it...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I am Santa Island Mask, the mysterious Servant who lives on Santa Island!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Santa Island Mask...!
He's boarding Llamrei Mark II...!

 
**Mash:**
Um, excuse me.
But are you Amaku&mdash;

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
 
I am Santa Island Mask!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
By the way, just because I'm wearing red doesn't mean I am in any way related to any “Emiya” or “Shirou”.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, really?
 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Nope. Not at all. I'm just red and tanned.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course not. Truly, your identity is shrouded in mystery.
 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Yes. Yes, it is.

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Okay! Now I know who you are!
But how come you're bothering me?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Ahem. Jeanne... Oh Jeanne...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
You mustn't let Fuuma not liking your present get you down.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
It is Santa's job to always get back up and always deliver smiles.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Always... smiles...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Stand and present. You must stand up... and give presents.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Even Scrooge made it in time.
There's no way YOU can fail, right?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Whenever you're lost, or in trouble, I shall appear.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Santa Island Mask...!
Does this make you my mentor?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Um... Sure... I guess...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Okay!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Heheh. Then I shall guide you on the path to becoming a true Santa.

 
## 4th Night: Merry Christmas in the Labyrinth
 
**Jack:**
Here are the plates!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Mister, is there anything else I can help with?
Oh, noisemakers! Those are important, right?

 
**Emiya:**
Mister... Well, I guess that's right. If I tell her not to call me Mister then I'll sound even older.

 
**Emiya:**
Oh hey you two, wait.
Be careful with the noisemakers.

 
**Emiya:**
The sound will echo in a labyrinth. You need to be mindful of your neighbors, especially at festival time.

 
**Both:**
Okay!

 
**Emiya:**
Sheesh... I had hoped to avoid a repeat of last year by spending this year alone in a quiet labyrinth.

 
**Asterios:**
Um... Sorry.

 
**Emiya:**
Don't worry. You got roped into this, too.
Don't be so timid.

 
**Emiya:**
I know this is foreign to you, but it's a celebration, so try to embrace it wholeheartedly.

 
**Emiya:**
Master and I are almost from the same era. Our generation has always gotten really excited about holidays and events.

 
**Emiya:**
Don't worry about me. Make noise, and have a good time.

 
**Asterios:**
Okay. Chriss...mas. Is...name?

 
**Jack:**
Guess what, guess what!
This year we asked Santa for a doll!

 
**Emiya:**
That's very unlike you... Ahem, erm, sorry, I mean, such innocence is just like you!

 
**Jack:**
They say the dolls of us are super popular!
So we want one as a present!

 
**Emiya:**
Oh? Wait a minute.
That's no doll, it's an action figure&mdash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Me too! Me too!! I asked for a book!
But a new tea set would be nice too!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
What did you ask for, Asterios?

 
**Asterios:**
Huh? Nothing...really&mdash;

 
**Both:**
Huh!? What a waaaaaaste!

 
**Jack:**
Ask for something!
Or we'll dismember you!

 
**Emiya:**
...Dismember? Oh, she means this'll be something to remember!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We'll help you! Asterios, what do you want?

 
**Asterios:**
Hmm... It's...secret...

 
**Jack:**
We hope your wish comes true!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We'll pray that your wish comes true!

 
**Asterios:**
Thanks. Hope...you...get...wish too...

 
**Emiya:**
Okay, food's ready. All that's left is&mdash;

 
**Both:**
To wait for Santa!

 
**Asterios:**
...Oh. Someone...is here...

 
**Jack:**
It must be Santa!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's go meet them!

 
**Emiya:**
So much energy.

 
**Emiya:**
Asterios, while they're going to see Santa, let's get ready.

 
**Asterios:**
Plates on...table... Okay...got it.

 
**Emiya:**
...Humph. A confidential message from Chaldea...? I didn't know they had my private contact info... Hello?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...We're lost, aren't we?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Absatively.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yeaaah... Maybe I was wrong to think I could just figure out the labyrinth...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, you've been blindly wandering around...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I had a revelation that this was the right way!
But...maaaybe it was just my imagination!

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hey, someone's here!
Good, it must be the people who asked Santa for presents!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hello! I'm Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!
Now, your present is&mdash;

 
**Monster:**
I'MMA GONNA EAT YOU UP!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Gyah&mdash;!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So I'm the present?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I don't have any er...ro...arrow presents like that! That kind of stuff is, um, will have to wait until you grow up!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're labyrinth lunch.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer, i-it's gonna eat us!

 

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**???:**
Santa! Santa!

 
**???:**
Wheeere aaare yooou!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Those voices!
The sweet voices of innocent children calling for Santa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Come on, let's shout back, Reindeer!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
We're heeere! Where are yooou?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh good. We finally found you!

 
**Jack:**
Are you okay? We heard a big scream.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
W-we're fine. Everything's fine. Anyway, were you the one who asked Santa for presents?

 
**Jack:**
Yep! ...Wait. Are you Santa?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Where's last year's Santa?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Oh!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
This year, I am the one true Santa:
Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!

 
**Jack:**
Too looong!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's a fun name, like spam!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Spam!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
But that's too bad!
I wanted to thank last year's Santa.

 
**Jack:**
Yeah. She gave us lots of presents.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Altria Santa gave you lots of presents?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yup, it was me and Jack's first Christmas, so she gave us lots of presents!

 
**Jack:**
We got to be friends with Reindeer, too!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
The last Santa did that...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Now, are you ready?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh? Ready? Ready for what?

 
**Jack:**
Aww, don't try and fool us! We know!

 
**Jack:**
You only get presents after you beat Santa in a fight!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
F-fight...?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Well, I guess being Santa this year has been looots of fighting...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Butbutbut! Santa spreads love, not battles!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It's what the Adult-Me stopped spreading.
...Stupid Adult-Me!!!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So. Now, this is happening... (sigh)
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I'm sorry. When I think about my future, I just can't help it...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Calm down, Little Alter.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hey! Don't call me “Little”!

 

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
She's flirting with Master. Bad Santa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I am not flirting!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Christmas is a time for children like us!
I won't let couples steal it!

 
**Jack:**
Let's get lots of presents, Nursery!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's do it, Jack!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Now, let's all gather round for story time! If you're naughty on Christmas, Krampus will come for you!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's treat our weird Santa Claus guest to our best hospitality!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We lost...

 
**Jack:**
 
Waaaahh!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh? Wh-what happens if you lose!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
If you lose, you don't get presents!
Christmas rules!

 
**Jack:**
The rules...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
But I do have presents for you...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...This is... A rose Black Key!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A rose Black Key!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A what, now?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
When he hears both the sobbing and cheering of little girls, he comes running...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I am... Santa Island Mask!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And then Christmas was saved...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I'm here!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
My mentooor...!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Humph... It would be rude to tell them they're wrong about Christmas.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Don't worry. Here's what you do. (Whisper whisper)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Um... But isn't lying bad...?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Christmas is a day where lies are okay!
April Fools? What's that?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I understand!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
G-gwah!
I. Have. Been. Defeated!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Hwah?

 
**Jack:**
Huh?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes, um... It seems like...um...
You used... Damage over time! Yes...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I'm so weak... I can't move another step...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I have no choice but to give you these presents, I guess...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You won!

 
**Both:**
Yaaay!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We won! We won! I'm so happy!
I'm so super-duper happy!

 
**Jack:**
Okay! Now it's time to dismember you!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Please don't.

 
**Jack:**
Oh, you're alive!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
See? It worked, right?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
R-right!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
But somehow, it just doesn't feel right...

 
**Jack:**
Is that masked person Mommy?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
No, unfortunately, I am not your mother.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
But in a way, Christmas is a day when everyone is your mother. Isn't that wonderful?

 
**Jack:**
Lots of mommies on Christmas? Really?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Santa Mask...what have you done...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No! That will only end badly!
 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hey, don't shout, Reindeer Master!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Heheh, now that I've ticked Master off, I shall bid you adieu!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
My mentooor...!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Okay, new Santa! It's time...

 
**Jack:**
...to invite you to our tea party!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Th-thank you very much.
I'll give you your presents there!

 
**Emiya:**
It took you a while. I assume you had to fight some weird Christmas battles.

 
**Emiya:**
Oh, Master... And you're the new Santa?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's right. This is the new Santa!
She's going to give us presents!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Her name's um... Um...

 
**Jack:**
Jeanne Spam d'Arc Spam Alter Spam Santa Spam Lily Spam, right?

 
**Emiya:**
What... That's... What?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Take the spam part out, please!

 
**Emiya:**
Oh, so it's like a code name.
But it's still long...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Emiya... You didn't request a Christmas present, did you?

 
**Emiya:**
Unfortunately, I'm too old for that.

 
**Emiya:**
And in my homeland, the parents and guardians are the ones to give the presents.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Asterios didn't make any requests, either.
Don't you have anything you want?

 
**Asterios:**
I do... But it's...okay...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hmph. You might think I'm not a really real Santa 'cause I'm young.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I may not look it, but I'm a full-fledged Santa Claus!
Now tell me what you want!

 
**Asterios:**
...I want...days like this...to last.
As long...as...possible...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh...?

 
**Asterios:**
Getting...summoned...like this...
Going...lots of places... Fighting&mdash;

 
**Asterios:**
Someday...will...end...
Sometimes...hard, but...

 
**Asterios:**
...It's fun...right now...
Even...labyrinth...is fun.

 
**Asterios:**
Like...a dream...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Um, that wish... I'm sorry... I can't grant it.

 
**Asterios:**
Yeah... So, it's okay...

 
**Asterios:**
Want...some food?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...No. I'm Santa. No food for me.

 
**Asterios:**
Too bad... It's good...

 
**Emiya:**
How long have you been Santa?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Th-this is my first year.

 
**Emiya:**
Hmm. So your Spirit Origin base was Jeanne d'Arc?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
E-enough talking about me.
Now, let's give these two their presents!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
What kind of present is it?
I can't wait! I just can't wait!

 
**Jack:**
A dolly! A dolly!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
...It'll be fine. I'm sure this will be useful...
For you two...

 
**Emiya:**
That's...

 
**Asterios:**
Huh?

 
**Jack:**
...What's this?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
What is it?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
A Hermitage is a quiet place where monks do special spiritual training...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
...It's so you can go someplace quiet... and study instead of just playing all the time...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I just thought studying...
Would help Jack and Nursery Rhyme...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Um... Well...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It would be good for you... No, it wouldn't.
I-I'm sorry!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Santa!?

 
**Jack:**
Sh-she ran away...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
What do we do? Santa got sad! On Christmas!

 
**Jack:**
Is it our fault?

 
**Emiya:**
No, it's not your fault.
Have some food before it gets cold.

 
**Both:**
Okay...

 
**Asterios:**
What...do we do...?
Th-this...is a problem...

 
**Emiya:**
Right, then... You, shady-looking guy in the mask who's been creeping in the corner this whole time.

 
**Emiya:**
You got a solution?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Let's see...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Before we start thinking about a solution, shouldn't we begin by identifying the problem?

 
**Emiya:**
That's fair enough.

 
**Emiya:**
Jeanne d'Arc is one thing, but...
Jeanne Alter... Especially in Lily form...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
No, I think I know the cause.
There's something she's missing.

 
**Emiya:**
Missing, huh...?
Hmm. What is it?

 
**Narration:**
...No matter what they say, I just don't have it.

 
**Narration:**
Practicality is all I am.
Every part of my being is about what's useful...

 
**Narration:**
I have no wish. I could die at any time. I have no hope.
I could vanish at any moment.

 
**Narration:**
E-even my existence was impossible from the moment it began...

 
**Narration:**
Something like me...an impossible being, an impossible concept...could have no wish.

 
**Narration:**
...But there was one thing I thought I could do...

 
**Narration:**
I could be someone who grants other people's wishes, instead of my own... I could be Santa Claus.

 
**Narration:**
I thought I could be Santa.
But...I was wrong.

 
**Narration:**
I borrowed the sack, and got Reindeer Master to come with me...

 
**Narration:**
But I don't know what makes people happy.
I don't know, so I keep failing and failing&mdash;

 
**Narration:**
And finally, I just ran away.
I couldn't do anything right as Santa...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
... (Sigh)

 
**F：???:**
Saaantaaa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Who-wha!?

 
**Jack:**
Oh, there you are!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Wow, you're so fast!
Were you going to leave your Reindeer!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I was not!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I don't have anything else to say to you once I've given you your present.
I have to go give the rest out...

 
**Jack:**
 
We don't need that present!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Uguh!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Y-you're right... You don't need it, do you?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yeah. Studying in a quiet place wouldn't be enough for us.

 
**Jack:**
So we're giving it baaack!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hic... Ohh...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Instead! Instead, we want you to grant our wish!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You had a wish...?
Um, wasn't it a doll, and&mdash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Nope! We don't need that!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We don't need a doll, or a stuffed animal, or cake, or a tree, or a star, or a party, or anything!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh? Th-then what do you want!?
There's nothing else I can give you&mdash;

 
**Jack:**
There is! There is something, Santa!
We want&mdash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We want to see the sea!

 
**Jack:**
We wanna go see the beach!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Th-the sea? When you say the sea...
You mean the ocean?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Um... I've only heard of it... But is it the place where it blows and roars, and is totally different than the land...

 
**Jack:**
We don't know the complicated stuff!
We don't know, but Asterios brags about it!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
He says it's big! Suuuper-big! Ultra-big!
He says we're like pebbles next to it!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
If we're pebbles, is Asterios a big rock?

 
**Jack:**
We've never left London, and never seen the sea!

 
**Jack:**
We died before we could.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Me too! I've never seen the sea!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Asterios went with Reindeer, and I hear they all rode on a boat and had a big adventure on the sea a while back!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'm jealous! I'm so really really jealous!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Sea... Boat... Big adventure... That's...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Wait a minute.
Are you saying that going to see the sea&mdash;

 
**Jack:**
Yup! That's our request!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You took back our present, so Santa will have to grant us our wish!

 
**Jack:**
Of course she will!
She's Santa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
B-but&mdash; But that's...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh, a rose Black Key.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Santa Island Mask, at your service!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
My mentor! Please, tell me!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What should I do!?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Well, you should grant their request.
You've taken back their gift.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Which means you have to grant them another wish.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
But children are selfish.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
So, if you don't grant their request, they'll keep throwing anything you give them right back in your face! They're such returnaholics!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
...That's how it goes with kids. So, that's why you should at least start by granting their wish.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I promise you that if you do, you can be a real Santa Claus.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...I-I understand!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Jack, Nursery Rhyme. I'll use the Llamrei Mark II to carry you to the sea!

 
**Both:**
Yay!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Okay, let's go!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't forget me!
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer Master!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Uh... It's not like I forgot about you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You know I'm still here, right?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...It's okay. I didn't forget you.
I would never leave you, Reindeer Master...

 

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I think she totally forgot.

 
**Jack:**
It completely slipped her mind!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
B-be quiet! Okay everyone, hop on the sleigh!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
The Llamrei Mark II is taking off! Oh, my mentor!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Yes?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Thank you! I'll do my best!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Thank you, huh? Oh, I wouldn't thank me... Heh, heh...

 
**Emiya:**
Why are you acting like a bad guy? Don't you have to go ahead of them? Let's get a move on.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
...I just wanted to end on a bad guy note, that's all.

 
## 5th Night: When You Wish Upon a Star, Again
 
**Jack:**
We're flying!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's like the Wizard of Oz!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are there three Ozes?
 
**Jack:**
...?
We're Jack!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I don't think that's what we're talking about.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So who's Oz?
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's me! Me!

 
**Jack:**
We're Jack!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Wah!? Llamrei Mark II, what's wrong!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
S-something's pulling us down!

 
**Mash:**
There's a Servant below us!
Some sort of power is pulling us down!

 
**Jack:**
Um, this is what's called...
Oh, right! A “crash!”

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Don't look so excited about it, Jack!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Everyone, grab on to something!
W-we're falling!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer, are you okay?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think I'm gonna throw up...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Please don't throw up! Definitely do not throw up!
I'm right underneath you!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Urmpf...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Are you throwing up!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
P-please don't throw up!

 

 
**Jack:**
Wow, that was a surprise.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You don't look surprised, Jack.

 
**???:**
Fwahahaha! I won't let you take another step!
You shall not pass!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Wh-who's there?

 
**Mash:**
I-it can't be...! Y-you're...!

 
**Leonidas:**
 
I am Leonidas! Santa, I cannot let you grant their wish of seeing the ocean!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
H-huh!? Why? Why?

 
**Leonidas:**
That's uhhh... Well... You see...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Some evil mastermind must be commanding him!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a conspiracy!

 
**Leonidas:**
Yes, exactly! We have been ordered not to let you show them the sea!

 
**Leonidas:**
By a mastermind. Yes, something like that!

 
**Leonidas:**
So...yes! You shall not pass!
Not another step! Definitely not!

 
**Jack:**
You're so mean! We don't like you, mister!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's right! Only meanies, devils, and the Queen of Hearts bully children!

 
**Leonidas:**
HEY! I don't like it either!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Why would you be upset about this!?

 
**Leonidas:**
Ah...Ahem! Yes, I am the meanest burly muscle-enemy! What of it?

 
**Jack:**
Way too muscly! He's not mommy!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Santa! Should we get him?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...I...guess?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Outta the way, Leonidas!
This Santa is taking them to see the sea!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Granting wishes is Santa's job.
I'll beat up anyone who stands in the way!

 
**Leonidas:**
Very well, Santa! You shall do so over my dead body!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We've defeated Leonidas...!

 
**Leonidas:**
Ha! Ha! Ha! It seems I have lost, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay then, we shall pass after all.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We won, so we'll be stepping over you.

 
**Leonidas:**
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

 
**Leonidas:**
Santa, there is still a group of Servants waiting ahead called the Fabulous Five, or the Magnificent Seven, or the Dirty Dozen or something like that!

 
**Mash:**
Th-that many!?

 
**Leonidas:**
What? There's not that many? I must have miscounted then... Pardon me. There may be a little less than that.

 
**Leonidas:**
...Anyhow, your journey to the sea will not be an easy one!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Wh-why are you getting in the way of Santa trying to fulfill a wish!?

 
**Jack:**
We just want to see the sea!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Meaniehead!

 
**Leonidas:**
You'll have to ask our evil mastermind!
I don't really, uh...know all the details either...

 
**Leonidas:**
I am a man of logic, so I am not very good in psychology and things like that!

 
**Leonidas:**
So please ask the next villainous Servant to come along!

 
**Leonidas:**
Farewell then, everyone!
Let us meet again at Chaldea!

 
**Mash:**
Servant has vanished.
I will go and speak with Leonidas later!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Is everyone all right?

 
**Jack:**
Yep!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Are you all right, Santa?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes! That was a cakewalk!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now what do you want, Santa Island Mask?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
So how about it, Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
It looks like there are a number of enemy Servants awaiting you in your journey to come.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Neither their identities nor goals are known, but they will try and put a stop to your grand Christmas quest.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Granting wishes is a hopelessly difficult journey.
But even if you do manage that, expect no reward.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Why? Because you are Santa Claus. There is no such thing as a reward for completing your task.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Will you still continue?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I...

 
**Jack:**
...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's something Santa must decide.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I... I want to grant their wish, instead of forcing a present they don't want on them.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I want to give them both exactly what they wished for!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
If the two of you don't mind, I would still like to grant your wish. So let's go see... the ocean!

 
**Both:**
Okaaay!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I see. Then, proceed with caution, Santa.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Fulfilling a wish is intrinsically an unequal thing. Unequal... That is, a problem of desire.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Be it a simple, casual wish or a desperate need with life hanging in the balance, it is Santa Claus who decides whether or not to grant it.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
The one who prays and pleads has their wish granted, while those who don't are not so fulfilled.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
...When you think about it, Santa may not be a saint at all.

 
**Narration:**
Santa may not be a saint at all&mdash;
That's what Santa Island Mask said.

 
**Narration:**
I wanted to argue and say it wasn't true.

 
**Narration:**
I wanted to say Santa Claus is a noble saint who grants everyone's wishes, and that's why I chose to become Santa.

 
**Narration:**
But I can't shake the feeling that what he said might really be true.

 
**Narration:**
...When I think about what happens after Christmas, I start trembling with fear.

 
**Narration:**
Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master.
Am I okay? Will I be okay?

 
**Narration:**
...Will I still be allowed to exist?

 
**Jack:**
Huh? It's no use.
The sleigh won't move.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh, even Santa's sleigh can break down.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I see... Well, we'd be in trouble if we got dragged down to the ground anyway!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Let's leave the sleigh here.

 
**Mash:**
Don't worry, we'll retrieve the sleigh later.

 
**Mash:**
Luckily, we aren't too far from the ocean.

 
**Mash:**
It may be a little taxing for Master though...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm okay, we can all walk.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I agree. Jack and Nursery Rhyme, are you two okay with that too?

 
**Jack:**
Umm, then we have a favor to ask Reindeer.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yes, I have something to ask of Reindeer too.

 
**Both:**
Ready and... Let's all hold hands and walk!!!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Hey, no fair...!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
No, I mean, you're making it difficult for Reindeer Master to walk! Stop it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't mind.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Uh, well... P-please mind!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
A Reindeer should not walk hand-in-hand with small children! Santa rules!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wanna join, Santa?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...!
W-well, if you insist... Hey, you're out of hands!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
What, your back? Piggyback?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
N-no, that's embarrassing. Please stop!!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Errr... Thank you...

 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Um, when you return, would you please give me... No, a piggyback ride is too embarrassing!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash? Maaash?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It would be nice for me to get in on an event one of these days... Maaash?

 
## 6th Night: It's a Wonderful Life, Santa!
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
This will be our campsite!

 
**Jack:**
Wow!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Fun, it's fun, so fun!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a slumber party...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A sleepover on Christmas.
What a carefree scene we have.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That aside, Fujimaru.
I transferred the goods you requested.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No problem, it's part of my job.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Spend the night here, and if all goes well, you'll reach the sea tomorrow.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If all goes well, that is!

 
**Jack:**
Oh? This feast...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's the feast Mister Emiya made for us!
We hurried out and forgot all about it!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...I feel a little bad...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rest assured and eat up. He said the key to party foods is that they taste good even when they get cold.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
D-Don't worry about me. I am not hungry.

 
**Jack:**
You're not?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'm sure she is. She's too proud to admit it, I bet.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I am not!

 
**Both:**
You are, you are!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Am. Not!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jeanne Alter Santa Lily!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Mggh!?
... (munch, munch, munch) ... (gulp)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
So tasty... I mean! Please don't shove food into my mouth.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Well, it was tasty, though.
Um...m-more, please?

 
**Jack:**
Piece of cake.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Did I just hear slander and label that I should definitely respond to!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
“Being faithful to one's principles” and “clarity of purpose” are my two mottos. Hmph!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Are those spells or something? I don't get it...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh, oh, oh, this roast beef is delicious!
Delicious, so deliiicious!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You should thank Emiya...
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Of course. When we get back, I'm planning on giving him headpats!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha, I can already see his face, looking like he hates it but fooling no one.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
And I'll scold him too.
Mister Emiya, quit stealing Noble Phantasms, okay?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Politely thank Mister Emiya.
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yes. I think I shall write a proper letter.
Daddy Long... no wait, what should I call him?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Dear Noble-Phantasm-Stealing Mister...

 

 
**G：???:**
Where did you hear that I stole things?
I'm merely copying for eternity.

 
**F：???:**
...What are you yelling about?

 
**G：???:**
I just felt like I had to clear some things up right here, right now.

 
**G：???:**
...Ahem, anyway, preparations are complete.

 
**F：???:**
But... This seems kind of ridiculous.
Why do we need to interfere?

 
**G：???:**
...Well, simply put, if her heart can't change, there's nothing we can do for her.

 
**G：???:**
For a wish-granter to try so desperately to avoid admitting her own wish... That's something of a paradox.

 
**G：???:**
She's deliberately blinding herself to what it really means to grant wishes.

 
**G：???:**
To even BE Santa Claus is to have the wish granted of being able to grant others' wishes.

 
**G：???:**
Unless you're pure evil, the feeling of so performing so many good deeds fills the heart.

 
**G：???:**
In a way, Santa Clause epitomizes that concept.

 
**G：???:**
A nice child receives a gift.
A naughty child receives a scolding.

 
**F：???:**
I see. But Jeanne, she&mdash;

 
**G：???:**
Right. She lacks that. And that's the problem.

 
**G：???:**
Left alone, she will lose sight of her reason to live, and maybe even lose her own identity.

 
**G：???:**
...It would be fine for a Heroic Spirit whose name is engraved in history.

 
**G：???:**
If someone has faith, and calls your name in awe, it doesn't matter if you have a wish or not.

 
**F：???:**
However... That's not the case for Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily.

 
**F：???:**
Nobody believes in her. Moreover, the world doesn't know of her at all.

 
**F：???:**
Even if they know of Jeanne d'Arc, nobody thinks someone like her existed behind the scenes.

 
**G：???:**
After all, she is a Servant born within Orleans.
A fake given temporary life by the Holy Grail.

 
**G：???:**
She barely managed to materialize as a Servant after slipping past several trials and causing a nightmarish commotion.

 
**G：???:**
But even materialization is uncertain in the Lily state.

 
**F：???:**
I see. That's why Altria Alter passed her the role of Santa.

 
**G：???:**
But, even given the role of Santa, she still carries a burden within her.

 
**G：???:**
Hopefully she'll come to understand it in the short journey to the sea&mdash;

 
**F：???:**
...By the way, what is the meaning of THAT?

 
**G：???:**
Heh, I have to at least hide my face.

 
**F：???:**
(So he is a bowman who knows nothing of disguises, I see...)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer Master, can't you sleep?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Jack and Nursery Rhymes both crawled into their sleeping bags.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Aren't those two Servants? It shouldn't be necessary to sleep when they're materialized.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
They are wasting needless magical energy.
Aren't they bothering you, Master Reindeer?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, not at all.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
They're not...? How come?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm going to take my spirit form so I don't cause trouble. I'm a good girl, aren't I? Ahem!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I prefer it this way.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Y-you prefer it that way?
But isn't it pointless?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I feel it's more proper for a Servant to stay in spirit form at times like this... So that's what I'll be doing!

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...But before that, I have a question.
Have you ever seen the sea, Reindeer Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I see... You have.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Is it really so great for the two of them to get all worked up over it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Actually, I haven't.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I see...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Does that mean no one in this party has ever seen the sea?

 

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...To be honest, I have never seen the sea.
My grown self, I mean the other...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
The original Jeanne d'Arc should have seen the sea in her lifetime...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
But me, I have no memory of the sea.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Besides... If what I know is right, don't people usually go to the sea in summer?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Winter seas are just for looking and not swimming.
So, um, what's the point in going?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sure you'll like it.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
You really think so? I can't imagine that.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
After all, unlike those two, I am an adult! Hee hee!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Waaah! Don't pinch my cheeks! Hey, stoppit!

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai!
It's snowing again today. Are you all right in the cold?

 
**Mash:**
Physical and mental parameters are all normal, it seems.

 
**Jack:**
To the seeea!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We'll reach the sea for sure today! Yaay!!!

 
**Mash:**
Head straight west from there&mdash;
Please wait, Master!

 
**Mash:**
Servants detected. There are two!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You do a better job than the Doctor.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, what, Fujimaru!?

 
**Mash:**
Master, you're good at compliments.
But I'm glad I can be of help with logistical support!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You've got a cuter voice than Roman.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahahahaha, you're dissatisfied with an old man's voice?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Perhaps. Mister Roman's voice sounds somewhat silly.
It warbles like a dying cat!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
He sounds like a really sad person who gave up on everything, and can't do anything but laugh!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Really, is that what you think?
I think that might be a bit much.

 

 
**???:**
May I finally make my appearance?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Wh-who's that!?

 
**???:**
Ahem. Hem-hem!

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hehehe... I am the cruel contortionist, Hassan of the Cursed Arm. I will not allow you to reach the sea...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Why not!?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Why, you ask!?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is there a different Santa!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could there be other Santas!?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Ah ha! Yes, that! ...Hehehe, because the real Santa is right here.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Um, that sounded kinda like you just thought of it when Master Reindeer said it.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hehehe... twist, twist. (Trying to dodge the accusation with suggestive contortions)

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Time to make your appearance!
The true Santa... Lord Santam!

 
**???:**
Heh... I ask of you: What is Santa?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Who's that!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
And Santa is the granter of wishes!
Someone who brings happiness by bringing gifts!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I...um, well, I may not be the best at that yet, though...

 
**???:**
Then, I shall answer you.

 
**???:**
Santas are faceless watchmen who wander from shadow to shadow, hidden from the world!

 
**???:**
Take a look, this is the proper form of a Santa!

 
**Santam:**
My name is Santam! I! We! Are Santam!

 
**Jack:**
...Huh?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...Oh?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Emiya... What are you doing there, Emiya?

 
**Santam:**
 
What!?

 
**Jack:**
What are you doing? Are you playing dress-up?
Should we join?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh, Mister Emiya. Playing make-believe masked heroes is embarrassing for adults, you know?

 
**Santam:**
How did they figure it out...!?
They couldn't figure out Santa Island Mask...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ahem. Anyway, Santam.

 
**Santam:**
I-I know. Hey, Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!

 
**Santam:**
I, Santam, was summoned to correct your mistaken view of Santa.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Mistaken...view of Santa...

 
**Jack:**
Mister has it all wrong too. (whisper)

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I know! (whisper)

 
**Cursed Arm:**
You over there, shush! Here, have some candy.

 
**Jack:**
(Nom nom)

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
(Nom nom)

 
**Santam:**
If you hesitate or run from this, then you are no true Santa!

 
**Santam:**
Come at me, Santa! But only if you truly believe you are Santa Claus!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I am...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. You are Santa.
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Yes! I am, without a doubt, Santa Claus!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
As long as Reindeer Master doesn't abandon me, I'll always be the really real Santa Claus!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're not Santa?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I don't know.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Perhaps Emi... I mean, Santam may be a better Santa than me...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I mean, he can copy anything and everything.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
The nerve! First he copies Noble Phantasms, now presents!? He's the Counterfeit King!

 
**Santam:**
...Forget about that!
This way I don't need to buy anything, at least.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...But!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
But, since Altria Santa has entrusted me with the bag,
I am Santa!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Please step aside, Mr. Santam...!

 

 
**Santam:**
All right. Come at me, young lady!

 
**Santam:**
By the way, I am an Archer, which doesn't really go well against a Lancer, but...never mind that!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Victory!

 
**Santam:**
Heh... And defeat for me.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...It felt like you were taking it super easy on us...
But we won! And that's what matters!

 
**Santam:**
Then move forward.
Never forget that you are a true Santa.

 
**Santam:**
And no matter who the enemy is...
Do not forget your duties as Santa.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Don't worry, Jeanne is a great Santa!

 
**Santam:**
Then we shall disappear as the defeated should.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh, nothing!
We've almost reached the sea!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't look too well...
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
It's nothing! I'm fine, yes, I'll be fine...

 

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Let us hurry ahead to play the role of the final blockade!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You look like you're enjoying yourself, Ama...
I mean, Santa Island Mask.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Well, it's been a while since I had a chance to play the villain!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
And with this impending betrayal, I'm getting all fired up!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahahahaha. Are you sure you're a Ruler?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Heheheh, whatever do you mean?
Right now I am just the mysterious Santa Island Mask.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
A masked man can only be a traitor, a villain, or a hero that cannot show his face.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, so you're not a hero?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I certainly will not call a man who gets in the way of a girl's dream a hero.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
...Now onward!
Santa Island Mask is coming...

 
## 7th Night: Last Present For You
 
**Narration:**
We're getting closer to the sea.
Our short but difficult journey will end soon.

 
**Narration:**
Will I still be able to be Santa? Will I still get to be the one who delivers gifts and hope?

 
**Narration:**
Or will I disappear, like a dream in morning?

 
**Narration:**
...That would've been fine.
At least, that's what I thought to start with.

 
**Narration:**
But why can't I feel that way now?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ruuuun!!!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Dolls are coming after us! It's scaaary!

 
**Jack:**
You should just let me dismember them!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I-I-I-I can't stand those creepy inorplantic types!
If they're living creatures I'm okay, but those, no!

 
**Mash:**
A-are you okay, Master!?
I noticed you're carrying all three of them now!

 
**Jack:**
Wheee!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Master's roaring along!
Zooooom! Fast like a hippogriff!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They're light!
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-I bet. I always pay careful attention to my weight!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're heavy!
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Hey! That's a rude thing to say to a lady!

 
**Jack:**
Grr.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Bring me a scale later.
I'll show you I'm really light!

 

 
**Mash:**
Oh!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Look down!

 
**Jack:**
It's a pebble!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eeeeeeep!?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Senpai! You fell flat on your face!
Are you all right!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer Master... You made sure to protect us even when you fell...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
That was such a nice thing to do, Reindeer Master! Awww! You!

 
**Jack:**
You okay? It hurts? Dismember?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No dismembering Master on Christmas, Jack!
 
**Jack:**
Too baaad.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My nose's bleeding...
 
**Jack:**
Looks painful... Want me to lick it?

 
**Jack:**
Liiick...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
EWW! Cut. It. Out!

 

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Look, they've caught up to us while we were messing around!

 
**Mash:**
They're already in battle mode.
Please ready your weapons!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
O-okay... Err, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I am not afraaaid! Waaagh!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
It's still coming after us even after it split in two, eww!!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Creaky mannequin dolls chasing us is definitely not a good fairy-tale!

 
**Jack:**
I'll dismember them all!

 
**Mash:**
Jack's really excited about this...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
A rose Black Key! That means&mdash;

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Yes, I'm sure you're getting tired of my entrance speech.
I know I am...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, yes. Whatever-Mask.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Thank you. My mentor...!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
There is no need for you to thank me, Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Huh?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Why...? Because I've led you into my dastardly, evil, villainous, wicked trap! Mwa ha ha!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
The hope of every Santa, the sack that contains every gift of the universe, shall be mine!

 
**Jack:**
?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Get it? I'm your enemy! Mwa ha ha!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!

 
**Mash:**
...Um, where did that lightning come from?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Try not to think about it too hard.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I-it can't be...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
The first rule of Santaing is that Santas must be aloof but fair. They grant wishes and give presents fairly, without bias.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Self-interest is unnecessary. All that is required is to embody the ideal that sustains the mechanism that is Santa Claus.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
You are lost, perplexed, and anguished...
Yet you still continue.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Is it bad to be lost and perplexed?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
It is. If you're Santa, then you must be rational.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Self-interest is unnecessary?
Even the desire to grant wishes?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
No. It is absolutely not needed for Santa.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Is...that true...?

 
**Jack:**
Um, um, Master?
What is “self-interest?”

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's the desire to do something for yourself.

 
**Jack:**
Ummm, so we want to go to the sea!
...Is that self-interest?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
That is correct.

 
**Jack:**
Jeanne... Don't you want to come with us and Nursery to the sea?

 
**Jack:**
We want you to come with us.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I agree, I want to go to the sea with Jack and Jeanne too!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Of course, Master's coming too!
Doing it together is what makes it fun!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
...I cannot be lending my ears to every bit of nonsense children say.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Now, kindly hand over the sack.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...I will not.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Oh-ho?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I DON'T WANT TO. I'll never give it up!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I cannot give this sack to someone who insults children!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
So what will you do now?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I will fight!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Please, Reindeer Master! Lead me to victory!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I want to win against this man!
No, that's not it.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I cannot lose to this man!
I just can't lose!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that, Santa Claus!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's grant your wish!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes! Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
As the really real Santa Claus, I'm gonna knock Santa Island Mask out!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Hehe... That's how...it should be...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Now, please stand aside!

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Please.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Now that I've seen your resolve as Santa Claus, I have no right to say anything more.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Go ahead.
Go, and see for yourself...

 
**Jack:**
Jeanne's already gone.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Aww...

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
...Then, Jack. I'll trust you with her.

 
**Jack:**
Yeah, leave it to us!

 
**Jack:**
...Should we dismember you?

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Thanks, but no thanks♪

 
**Mash:**
Oh, there isn't any snow around here.
You're almost to the sea.

 
**Mash:**
But if you want to see the sea, please hurry.
It's almost dusk. It will soon be night.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
So exciting, Jack!

 
**Jack:**
We wonder what it's like.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I wonder if you can swim.
Maybe not, since it's winter.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Hey, Jeanne.
...Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
S-sorry. What is it?

 
**Jack:**
Ummm, you want to hold hands?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh, no. I'm fine...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...You're trembling.
Then I'll hold your hand, too!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
G-geez. Um, Reindeer Master...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You three go on ahead.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll catch up later.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Understood.
Then, we're on our way!

 
**???:**
...Right. That was my dream when I was young.

 
**???:**
The vast sea spreading across the horizon was a tale I had only heard about.

 
**???:**
Even if I pretended a wheat field was the sea, I could not hear the sound of the waves.

 
**???:**
My dream came true after everything was over.

 
**???:**
Yes, it was the winter of 1430. When I passed through Le Crotoy, I indeed saw the sea.

 
**???:**
Even if everything was over.
Even if I understood the destiny that awaited me.

 
**???:**
That beauty. That sense of awe that made me tremble.

 
**???:**
It was unforgettable. It was a scene beyond comparison to anything&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
(Panting)

 
**Jack:**
(Panting)

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
This is really hard on a book, sheesh...!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh&mdash;

 
**Narration:**
The waves crashed and roared.
The violent winds howled.

 
**Narration:**
It may not have been alive, but for all its ferocity, it may as well have been.

 
**Narration:**
Somehow, it was as frightening as the beginning of the world, but as beautiful as the end of all things.

 
**Narration:**
A gift that, supposedly, was never meant to be, was being opened before my eyes.

 
**Narration:**
...In the end, I was probably a failure as Santa.

 
**Jack:**
Wow, this is the sea?
Amazing. It's really amazing!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's amazing, it's scary, but it's so pretty!
And the sunset is beautiful!

 
**Jack:**
The sun is setting!
It looks like it's melting into the ocean!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...

 
**Jack:**
Can't we go swimming?
It should be all right, we're Servants!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Maybe it's disgraceful.
Oooh, water is bad for paper!

 
**Jack:**
Awww. Then what about you, Jeanne?
Jeanne, you don't mind, right?

 
**Jack:**
...Jeanne?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Jeanne?

 
**Both:**
Eh...!?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Ah, aah... Aaah...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...This. Right, this. I was wrong from the beginning.
I was wrong.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
This. Is. My. Dream...!!
I wanted to see the sea...!!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I wanted to see this. I wanted to see this...! For the longest, longest time, I wanted to see the sea...!!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
Waaaaaaaaaaah...!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!

 
**Jack:**
Jeanne...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
 
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
We didn't come here to grant your wishes.
This is&mdash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...It's fine. It's fine.

 
**Jack:**
Yeah, it's fine. We don't mind.

 
**Jack:**
You really did your best.
You did the best any Santa could.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Okay.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's listen to the churning waves.
Let's watch the waves break.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
A primordial display, as fierce as the end of the world. And yet, it's such a beautiful scene&mdash;

 
**Jeanne:**
I'm so glad she realized...

 
**Mash:**
Eh? Jeanne!? What in the world is going on here...!?

 
**Jeanne:**
Wanting to see the sea...was my wish, my desire.

 
**Jeanne:**
It was a silly dream I had in my childhood. So much so that when I departed at age 17, I had left it behind.

 
**Jeanne:**
...That girl is not a saint.
That said, she is not an Avenger, either.

 
**Jeanne:**
My young self was simply a child who enjoyed everyday life.

 
**Jeanne:**
So, in order to maintain her body as a Servant, there was a need to become something.

 
**Jeanne:**
...But, she had wished to become Santa.
Even though no child should become Santa Claus.

 
**Mash:**
Children should not become Santa Claus?

 
**Jeanne:**
A proper Santa is what Amakusa&mdash;no, is exactly what Santa Island Mask said.

 
**Jeanne:**
The ideal Santa must be impartial in delivering presents.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...? I didn't mind that when I delivered.

 
**Jeanne:**
Oh, please. But, for children, that is impossible.

 
**Jeanne:**
Because children should be the ones receiving presents. Not the ones giving them out.

 
**Jeanne:**
Of course, it's different if they're giving something to someone specific. That's a gift given out of personal desire.

 
**Jeanne:**
But Santa Claus isn't like that. Santa's purpose is to deliver love and presents impartially, to all.

 
**Jeanne:**
But children desire presents more than anyone else.
All the more so if they haven't wished for anything yet.

 
**Jeanne:**
That's what I hoped her time as Santa Claus would teach her, somehow.

 
**Jeanne:**
I wanted her, Jeanne, to harbor a desire.

 
**Jeanne:**
...However, the story went...a little astray.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I never imagined she would be so stubborn.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I thought that after passing out two or three presents, she would realize she harbored her own desires.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Just how selfless are you?

 
**Jeanne:**
It's just that my everyday life was fulfilling...
I'm sure I wasn't that charming of a child.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I managed to figure out Jeanne's wish, and asked Jack and Nursery.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I asked them to grant her wish.

 
**Mash:**
Eh? So this journey was...!?

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes. This journey was never about her becoming Santa Claus&mdash;

 
**Jeanne:**
It was a chance for Santa Claus to become Jeanne Alter Santa Lily.

 
**Mash:**
Everyone who appeared along the way...

 
**Santa Alter:**
If she were to give up after one or two obstacles, we would've been forced to take a different approach.

 
**Santa Alter:**
But she trudged forward, so it must truly have been her dream to see the sea.

 
**Jeanne:**
And, there is one more important thing.
It wasn't merely going to go see the sea.

 
**Jeanne:**
Even after all her struggles, she was able to go see the sea with her dear friends.

 
**Jeanne:**
As long as she has this memory, she will continue to exist as a Servant.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Oh, so the cat's out of the bag.
Can I revive myself now?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you must.
 
**Santa Island Mask:**
My gosh. Even as a child, she was a formidable opponent! I couldn't afford to go easy on her.

 
**Santa Island Mask:**
I actually fought like I meant it, and she took me down.

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nope. Stay dead.
 
**Santa Island Mask:**
Ehhh? Aren't we done?
All three of them reached the sea.

 

 
**Mash:**
Wh-whaaaa!? Santa Island Mask came back to life?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
My gosh. Well, we kind of railroaded the plot, but we managed to finish.

 
**Jeanne:**
Thank you very much.
I never imagined you would help me&mdash;

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Hahaha, of course!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
To have more Jeanne Alters you don't get along with! What could be better?

 
**Jeanne:**
So that was your ulterior motive. Geez!
...But, I am happy with how this worked out.

 
**Jeanne:**
She may not be me, but she has untapped potential that even I don't...

 
**Jeanne:**
Honestly, I'm happy.
It feels like I gained a little sister.

 
**Santa Alter:**
You should say that to the original Jeanne Alter.
That will really upset her.

 
**Jeanne:**
I know. That's why I won't tell her.

 
**Mash:**
I see... So everything was a scheme Amakusa and Jeanne cooked up.

 
**Mash:**
I was completely fooled.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
No, it wasn't me.

 
**Jeanne:**
Nor was it me. I could have never gotten this far...

 
**Santa Alter:**
Though I was the one who mentioned Jeanne Alter Santa Lily would disappear as she was...

 
**Santa Alter:**
The plan itself wasn't actually mine.

 
**Mash:**
Eh, then who was it? Santam?

 
**Emiya:**
What? No!
Heh... Mash, you haven't figured it out?

 
**Mash:**
Eh...?

 
**Emiya:**
The one who planned this is the one who understands Servants the most.

 
**Emiya:**
The one who understands who is best for which role, and who should guide her along the way.

 
**Emiya:**
And, it must be someone that THE Jeanne Alter trusts from the bottom of her heart, even in her Lily form.

 
**Emiya:**
Really, there is only one such mastermind in all the world, isn't there?

 
**Mash:**
 
Ah... Aah!!!

 
**Mash:**
...MASTER!?

**Fujimaru 1:**
Busted...

 
**Mash:**
M-Master, you set all of this up!?

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, the way you improvised your way through situations, and the way the Servants were appropriately placed was remarkable.

 
**Santa Alter:**
It was also Fujimaru's plan to make it look like Llamrei Mark II's engine was broken after the crash.

 
**Mash:**
...H-hold on a second!

 
**Mash:**
Why didn't anyone tell me?

 
**Jeanne:**
Th-that's because...

 
**Santa Alter:**
Master told us to stay quiet. We were told that Mash could not tell a lie, and telling her would ruin the plan.

 
**Mash:**
 
SEEEENNPAAAAIIIII!?

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-I'm sooorry!!

 
**Mash:**
Oh! So when the Doctor said there was emergency maintenance...!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Of course he was playing along.

 
**Mash:**
I'm going to the Doctor to protest right this instant!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Try to go easy on him.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, of course. I have to save some energy for you, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whew...
 
**Mash:**
I hate to burst your bubble, but brace yourself when you return, Master!

 

 
**Emiya:**
Heh. She's pouting.

 
**Emiya:**
Girls of that type hold grudges for a long time.
You should make it up to her soon.

 
**Emiya:**
At a time like this, your best bet is giving her a present.

 
**Jeanne:**
(He seems quite used to this...)

 
**Santa Alter:**
(Indeed...)

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
(He must have had to do plenty of “making up” during his lifetime...)

 
**Emiya:**
...?
(Sometimes this place is the worst...)

 
**Leonidas:**
Are we done? Did it all work out?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
It seems everything worked out for the best.
What a relief!

 
**Jeanne:**
Thank you all for your hard work.
I'm sorry for roping you into this too, Asterios.

 
**Asterios:**
No...worries!
Wish granted...I'm...happy.

 
**Asterios:**
I knew...now is...the most...fun!

 
**Emiya:**
The other Servants are gathering in Chaldea.
This...will be quite the party.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master!

 
**Jeanne:**
...Quick, everyone, let's hide!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Reindeer Master!
I figured it out now that I reached the sea!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'm Santa, but I'm still young.
I'm immature, selfish, and helpless&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
But still, I'm here right now!
I want to do my best to help you, Reindeer Master!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
So, um, well, even when Christmas is over, even if spring, summer, and autumn come...!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Can I stay by your side?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Thank you sooo much! You are the bestest...
I love you, Reindeer Master!
