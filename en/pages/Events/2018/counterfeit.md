# Da Vinci and the 7 Counterfeit Heroic Spirits

## Prologue: "Lisa del Giocondo's Graceful Holiday"
 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;I can't believe this.

 
**Da Vinci:**
This is impossible. It's just not possible,
but...this is without a doubt “me.”

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Wait, no. This is “me,” and yet it isn't.

 
**Da Vinci:**
The skill is not all there, but the passion is.
That passion is forcing “me” to become more like “me.”

 
**Da Vinci:**
Actually, I'm a little bit put off by this passion...

 
**Da Vinci:**
The passion on this canvas... It's like wearing layers of coats in the summer, with the heat on full blast, and eating hot udon all at the same time.

 
**Da Vinci:**
How do I know!? That's because I'm always a perver...
I mean, passionate!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, back on topic.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Curse you! Who would do something so blasphemous!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
I can't just sit around like this. At this rate, Romani will lecture me... I mean...

 
**Da Vinci:**
This is a problem that could cause the Foundation of Humanity to collapse, thus creating a new Singularity!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay! Activating emergency alarm system!
Everyone, assemble!

 
**Emiya:**
...Trace ...On.

 
**Mash:**
I see... So this is how you create your twin blades.

 
**Mash:**
I was wondering how you get them back so fast every time they shatter.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou.
Fou, fou.

 
**Emiya:**
Yes. However, it's more accurate to say that I create a copy that's not better or worse than the original.

 
**Emiya:**
No matter how similar it is to the real thing, it's never as strong. I guess fiction is too light to support the weight of reality.

 
**Emiya:**
Although my projections must be similar to the originals. However, even if I create an identical copy, it's no more than reflections on the surface of water.

 
**Emiya:**
They're nothing more than counterfeits, different from the originals.

Different in what way?

 
**Emiya:**
It would take a while to explain everything, so let me skip that for now.

 
**Emiya:**
However, that doesn't mean the counterfeits will always perform worse than the originals, if we're just talking numbers.

 
**Emiya:**
If both of them perform equally well, it's not the “objects” themselves that decide which is better, but the “audience.”

 
**Emiya:**
It's not really a nice topic for the people who made the originals...

 
**Emiya:**
However, humans are a species that constantly aims for the future. The concept of improvement is necessary to move forward.

 
**Emiya:**
Originals made from scratch are valuable, yes,
but so are the imitations derived from them.

 
**Emiya:**
My projections are just copies, but the imitations in this world are originals that have been developed further.

 
**Emiya:**
What starts from one expands out into infinite possibilities and shapes the future.

 
**Mash:**
I see. That's very deep.

 
**Emiya:**
Anyway, let's get back to cleaning the rooms.
Master, are you keeping your room clean?

I always keep it clean.
 
**Emiya:**
Excellent. One's room is the reflection of their mind.

 
**Emiya:**
The fact that you keep your room tidy reflects your personality.

Sometimes it gets messy.
 
**Emiya:**
Oh, you mean at Halloween and Christmas?
Remember, one's room is the reflection of their mind.

 
**Emiya:**
In other words, you are the type that gets excited whenever there's an event.

 

 
**Mash:**
Hehehe, he's right on the spot, huh?
Senpai.

 
**Emiya:**
Hmm?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Mash:**
The emergency alarm...
Something is happening, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, is there an emergency?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry I'm late!
What was that emergency alarm just now?

 
**Mash:**
You just got here?
Wait, aren't you the one who sounded the alarm?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'd feel better if that was me, but it wasn't.
Normally I'd be tuning Chaldea's reactor at this hour.

 
**Mash:**
Then, who could it be?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahem. Testing, testing! Testing, testing! As this is an emergency situation, I have taken over the intercom.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Attention all Servants who can stand by and accept our Master's recklessness with a smile.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Empty your minds and come to my workshop immediately!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course, you are to bring your weapons.
Oh, Romani is annoying so he can't come.

 
**Da Vinci:**
You have one minute!
Now hop to it!

 
**Emiya:**
Hey, what happened?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...It seems to be something she can't say for now. Anyway, let's head over there.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, there you are! As expected, Fujimaru!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I knew you'd come, too, Mash! Hmm, and it looks like you've also brought... Huh, only Emiya?

 
**Da Vinci:**
I thought surely seven nosy Servants would be lured here...

 
**Emiya:**
I think once they found out the alarm was from the Da Vinci Workshop, none of them wanted to come anymore.

 
**Emiya:**
I on the other hand was already talking to Fujimaru, so I simply tagged along.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Whaaaaat? Am I really that unpopular?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course. Maybe you should change that attitude of yours. I heard even Dr. Tesla can understand other people's feelings more.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ugh. Romani. Why did you come? I told you not to!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you tell someone not to come, of course their curiosity will get the better of them!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What did you do this time?
I may be a coward, but even I get mad sometimes.

 
**Da Vinci:**
You misunderstand. This time it's not just my problem, but the entirety of Chaldea's problem.

Sounds like trouble.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's right. We're in such big trouble I feel like my rationality is gonna be gone like Astolfo.

 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay, there's no time. I will get to the point!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I have reached the truth of this world.
At last, I have identified its lies!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, hello? Medical team? Do you have a spare bed?
We have a weirdo here who's gone insane.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If you're not going to listen then leave!

 
**Emiya:**
Doctor, I know how you feel, but let's hear her out for now.

 
**Emiya:**
Regardless of his personality, he&ndash; I mean she is the universal genius, Leonardo da Vinci.

 
**Emiya:**
There has to be some truth in her words, right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I suppose so, but...
That's what makes it worse.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, as expected from the Hero of Wrought Iron.
Nice save, Emiya!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Makers will never forget how to respect one another. Maybe Romani should show more respect for me.

 
**Mash:**
That would be an issue, Da Vinci.
Now, what do you mean by the world's lies?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Right.
First, take a look at this.

 
**Mash:**
This is&ndash;

The infamous Mona Lisa!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hahaha. I won't deny that. A lot of blood and money has been shed for this painting, hasn't it?

 
**Mash:**
She has a smug look on her face for some reason, Senpai!

**Fujimaru 2::**

It's truly the center of deceit!
 
**Da Vinci:**
How could you say that in front of the greatest painting in history? ...Well, I'll admit I made a ton of money copying and pasting the same painting.

 
**Mash:**
She's admitting it, Senpai!

 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hahaha. Well, anyway.
This is indeed the Craft Essence, Mona Lisa.

 
**Da Vinci:**
However, this one wasn't made by my workshop.

 
**Emiya:**
...I could tell. It's very well-done, but it's a counterfeit. It's very meticulous, but I can sense anger from it as well.

 
**Emiya:**
It's a step below the one created by Ms. Da Vinci, which costs more than a thousand Mana Prisms, a VERY VALUABLE magical resource.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I sense sarcasm in your words, but that's right!
This is a counterfeit!

 
**Da Vinci:**
To think someone would... Copy! My! MONA LISA!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I don't mean copy-and-paste!
Each was painted from scratch!

 
**Mash:**
That's amazing.
I can't tell the difference at all.

 
**Emiya:**
You can spot a poorly made counterfeit from the technique.

 
**Emiya:**
If it's a well-made counterfeit, you can naturally tell the difference from the aura it gives off.

 
**Emiya:**
All creative works, not just swords, contain the ideals, emotions, and likes and dislikes of the one who made them.

 
**Emiya:**
If one is desperate... No, if one puts their life on the line to feel the same way the original creator did, then it would be hard to tell the difference.

 
**Emiya:**
This Mona Lisa...is incredible in its intensity and passion. Unfortunately, what it's lacking in is technique.

 
**Emiya:**
It's a rare counterfeit that seeks to make up for its lack of skill with passion. Usually it's the other way around.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Indeed. By the way, is your class Artist?

 
**Emiya:**
It's Archer. So, what's wrong with this counterfeit?

 
**Emiya:**
There's nothing wrong with having a passionate follower, right? Isn't that what all creators want?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Actually... Mona Lisa hasn't been selling well lately.

What? They did at one point?

 
**Da Vinci:**
THEY DO SELL!
They're the biggest hit from my workshop!

 
**Da Vinci:**
But all of a sudden they stopped selling!
I thought it was strange and went to look, and found this!

 
**Da Vinci:**
At first glance, they look the same and kinda have similar effects, but the price is only a tenth of the original!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you understand what I'm trying to say now, right!?

You're useless now?
 
**Da Vinci:**
The truth is so cruel...
But that's what will happen at this rate!

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, right. So basically an underworld broker is selling better Craft Essences for cheaper than Da Vinci's workshop.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's wrong with that? You're supposed to be in charge of Sheba and the summoning system anyway.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No one likes this workshop anyway,
so maybe you can just let the fake&mdash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
I will straight-up murder you, Romani.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, right! Sorry!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahem. Oopsies! My real personality came out☆
Back to what we were saying&mdash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
Listen. Whoever's making this counterfeit is undeniably evil!

 
**Emiya:**
(...I don't know. It feels twisted, but the passion within it is pure...)

 
**Da Vinci:**
And so, Fujimaru, I want you to find out who's making these...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...and defeat them, no questions asked!

 
**Mash:**
Finding and arresting an underworld broker?
That doesn't sound like Senpai's job...

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, it most certainly is Fujimaru's job.
I mean, whoever is doing it can only be evil.

 
**Da Vinci:**
They must be the kind of demon that's filled with enough maliciousness to destroy this world.

 
**Da Vinci:**
They're probably the strongest enemy you've ever faced, but don't worry! This time... I'll be going with you!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gwah!? No, no! What are you saying, Leonardo?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chaldea needs you! If you're defeated, our effectiveness will drop by half!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
As the person in charge here, I can't allow that!
You can't leave over something that doesn't matter...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm?
It doesn't matter, you say?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;R-Right. Art is at the core of your soul, huh?
I'll get the Rayshift ready.

**Dr. Roman:**
...Well, I can't think of a way to stop Leonardo if she's already this angry...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And to tell the truth, we can't ignore the question of where these counterfeits are coming from.

 

 
**Emiya:**
Oh, right. I had a pressure cooker running in my room. The beef for my stew should be done now.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey! Emiya!

 
**Emiya:**
Tch! I was too late!

 
**Mash:**
Ah! Emiya-senpai, you were trying to run, weren't you?

 
**Emiya:**
No... I wasn't... Fine, I was.

 
**Emiya:**
It's just that I'm busy. I have to tune my weapons, clean my room, chat with the operator girl...

 
**Emiya:**
As you can see, a Servant has many duties.

 
**Mash:**
Good point, but I've already finished cleaning all the rooms.

 
**Emiya:**
W-Well... You see...
These kind of events aren't really my forte...

 
**Mash:**
Let's go, Master, Emiya-senpai!
Let's go on a journey to find the counterfeits!

 
**Mash:**
The more, the merrier! Right now the more sensible Servants around the better.

 
**Mash:**
I haven't had this bad a feeling since that space rocket! For Senpai's sake too! Please!

 
**Emiya:**
So you're asking not for your own sake, but your Master's... In that case...Hmmm...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash is really growing up...

Well done, Mash. We can all suffer together.
 

 
**Mash:**
Of course. All I can do right now is keep you safe!

 
**Emiya:**
...Humph. Very well. I give up.
I'll go with you.

 
**Emiya:**
So? Where are we going first?
You must have some idea, Ms. Da Vinci.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course. Just leave that to me! Okay, Roman, I'm going to borrow the Rayshift for a bit.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Don't worry. With Fujimaru's help we can solve this is no time!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Off to the Rayshift we go!
Wow, my first Rayshift! I'm so nervous!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Now, after tracing and observing the Spiritron information on the counterfeits, I've concluded they came from these coordinates in this era.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm, it's been so long since I stepped outside of Chaldea. The feeling of dirt, the breeze on my cheeks...

 
**Da Vinci:**
It's good to be alive, isn't it, Fujimaru?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Come, come, let's go find that jerk who's making all the counterfeits!

 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci's really excited!

 
**Emiya:**
She's been cooped up in her workshop until now.
She's probably both an indoor and outdoor person.

 
**Emiya:**
Let's start by heading for the town.
The first thing we need is information.

 
**Mash:**
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the town. It's very peaceful and pleasant.

 
**Emiya:**
Yes. Let's start with something basic.
We'll show the counterfeit to someone passing by.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I understand.

That escalated quickly!
Let's finish this and go home!

 
**Caesar:**
What is this sudden attempt at arrest?

 
**Caesar:**
Every fight has its reasons.
Even if we are in the wrong, shouldn't you tell us why!?

 
**Caesar:**
Some truths can only be found through dialogue!
Let's talk about this! That's how I win!

 
**Emiya:**
I already know that talking with you is a trap that we can't fall into!

 
**Caesar:**
What... Have we done business together once before!?

 
**Paracelsus:**
So it seems... How sad... Trust is such a fragile thing...

Quite the contrary!

 
**Mash:**
That's right, Master!

 
**Caesar:**
Hmm... If conversation is impossible, I suppose I'll act like a politician, and settle things by force.

 
**Caesar:**
Because I'd like to get rid of the negative image that
“if anything bad happens, it's probably Caesar!”

 
**Paracelsus:**
I agree, Caesar.
I, P, know exactly how you feel.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I'm opposed to violence, but I will join in the fight.
Don't worry. It's possible to brainwash them mid-battle.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I want to say this loud and clear!
We are innocent&ndash;!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey, making someone laugh before battle is not right!
I almost dropped my staff!

How can you honestly claim that you're innocent?

Caesar, is that true?
 
**Caesar:**
It's true!

 
**Caesar:**
Selling those counterfeits for cheap wouldn't bring in any money anyway.

 
**Caesar:**
First I'd tell the customer that I'm offering the real Mona Lisas! Then I'd buy up all of the Craft Essences from Da Vinci.

 
**Caesar:**
Why? Because as long as I've got the real ones with me, the customers would be willing to pay full price...

 
**Caesar:**
without having to worry about them being fakes!
To just distribute the counterfeits for free like that&mdash;

 
**Caesar:**
I swear to you on my very soul.
I would never do something so wasteful!

 
**Mash:**
This Caesar is also the real thing!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Indeed. He knows that trust is the strongest foundation for a business.

P, are you trying to do what you think's best, again?
 
**Paracelsus:**
Even if I did make Mona Lisa counterfeits... I don't think that would have any good effect on the world.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The Mona Lisa is the pinnacle of art.
Not many paintings share that same level of fame.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Degrading it to the level of counterfeits is unthinkable even in the world of magecraft.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...However, if something can be created by sacrificing the original, I guess that would be all right...

 
**Da Vinci:**
It wouldn't be all right!
My heart would sustain heavy damage!

 

 
**Mash:**
But... I guess the two of them aren't behind the counterfeits.

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry...we got ahead of ourselves.

 
**Caesar:**
Humph. Don't be sad, oh girl who is plump and firm in a different way than me.

 
**Caesar:**
After all, we secretly Rayshifted here because we heard about the rumors of the counterfeits.

 
**Caesar:**
I thought I could use Paracelsus as a decoy and brought him here... Hahaha, I didn't expect to get caught before we split up.

 
**Paracelsus:**
It's embarrassing, but I thought the same thing.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I was going to stand behind Caesar and use Sword P to get rid of both him and the counterfeiter.

 
**Emiya:**
I think that mage over there needs to reconsider what “embarrassing” means... Anyway...

 
**Emiya:**
For now, we're the ones asking questions. I would have you tell us everything you know about the counterfeits.

 
**Caesar:**
We're sure there's a group of counterfeiters in this town. My “money sensor” tells me so.

 
**Caesar:**
But there's one problem. I'm told a Servant is running the counterfeiter's workshop.

 
**Mash:**
...What!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
A-A Servant!
...I see. That explains it.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But who could it be? Michelangelo? Raphael?
Or perhaps... Donatello?

 
**Da Vinci:**
There's so many...
Him? Her? Who?

 
**Emiya:**
I can guess what kind of relationships Leonardo da Vinci had in life.

 
**Caesar:**
I don't know who it is myself.
Their workshop is here. Go pay them a visit.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay, thanks!
Off to the counterfeiter's workshop, everyone!

 
## Section 1: Counterfeit "The Innocent Boy"
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We're almost there.
I'm picking up multiple enemy signals.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Be careful!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yuck. It looks just like my workshop!

 
**Mash:**
And it's not just the Mona Lisa...

 
**Da Vinci:**
You're right! The Annunciation, the Vitruvian Man...
Even the Last Supper!?

 
**Emiya:**
They're better preserved than the ones that exist now in 2018.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm? What's this...

 
**Emiya:**
Is that your manuscript?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Let me see... Yes, this one's mine.
However, this one's a counterfeit.

 
**Mash:**
This one is the real one, and that one over there is a fake... Master, I can't tell the difference at all...

The manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci stretch for thousands of pages, and that's just what exists now.

 
**Emiya:**
It also uses mirror writing, which means making a counterfeit must've required a ton of effort.

 
**Emiya:**
I can understand the reason behind the Mona Lisa and the other paintings, but why the manuscripts?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay, let's take them all with us!

 
**Mash:**
Huh? All of them?

 
**Mash:**
One or two wouldn't be a problem, but to take all of these back with us...

Let's get to it!

 
**Mash:**
Get them loaded up!

 
**Emiya:**
You guys change your mind fast, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry to interrupt you when you're working, but I'm seeing enemies! Be careful!

 
**Mash:**
Enemy signals detected!
They seem...different than normal enemies!

 
**Emiya:**
Don't worry. In terms of strength, they're no different than regular enemies.

 
**Emiya:**
&ndash;Let's do it!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now I'm seeing a Servant!
It's close!

 
**Mash:**
Thanks, Doctor!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hmm?
No, what is this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a Servant... But it looks a little crude.
Like parts of it are patched together.

 
**Emiya:**
Crude?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Shadow Servant is literally a fake&mdash;a shadow modeled after a Heroic Spirit's Spirit Origin.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is just “something very similar.” It's a well-made Spirit Origin down to the details, but...

 
**Emiya:**
Should we call it a counterfeit?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. That's exactly right.

 
**Emiya:**
...That explains it. No wonder something didn't feel right.

 
**Emiya:**
In other words, you're not exactly a pure Servant.

 
**Emiya:**
Alexander the Great...

 
**Alexander:**
Yes, that's right!

 
**Alexander:**
We are counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We're Servants, yet we are neither pure Servants nor pure heroes.

 
**Alexander:**
Go easy on me, okay♡

 
**Mash:**
So beautiful... His smile is so beautiful!

 
**Emiya:**
The spitting image of an enchanting young boy.
Any opinions as an artist?

 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;I'm in love. I'd like to draw his naked body.
No, I want to get naked and draw him!

 
**Emiya:**
...I see. Do it in a dimensional rift so you don't bother anyone.

 
**Emiya:**
Okay, Alexander.
Tell us who made you and what your goal is.

 
**Emiya:**
I won't hurt you. I may not look it, but I'm a man who understands counterfeits.

 
**Alexander:**
You're lying, mister!
You're going to hurt me, I know it!

 
**Alexander:**
Once you get the information you'll kill me in a heartbeat, won't you?

 
**Emiya:**
What kind of barbarian do you think I am?
I'll capture you, but after that, it's up to you.

 
**Emiya:**
For one thing, your body is...
No, I won't say it. I'm sure you're well aware.

 
**Alexander:**
Yup. No need to bring that up.
I don't worry about that kind of stuff at all.

 
**Alexander:**
What's required from me now is innocence and purity. That's what will bring her peace.

 
**Alexander:**
On the other hand, that also means all she wanted was my abilities, without any unnecessary elements.

 
**Alexander:**
But I guess that's fun in its own way.

 
**Mash:**
“She”?
Who can that be...

 
**Alexander:**
Too bad! That's a secret!

 
**Alexander:**
I mean, right now I am “a talented little stepbrother who adores the big sister living with him!”

 
**Mash:**
...
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh?
I'm sorry, what?

 
**Alexander:**
Heheh! It's so romantic, isn't it?

 
**Alexander:**
To be honest, I didn't quite get that backstory either, but it's a very girly wish!

 
**Alexander:**
Come on, [♂ mister /♀ lady]♡
It's time for war!

 
**Emiya:**
That intensity. Those words. Even if you are a counterfeit, you are the man who'll someday become the King of Conquerors.

 
**Emiya:**
Very well.
Let's fight him, Master!

**Alexander:**
Hmm... I guess that's it, then.
Hahaha! I figured it would be hard to actually win.

 
**Alexander:**
To get so close and still be so far...
That's what is sad about being a fake, isn't it?

 
**Emiya:**
That's not true. It was a fight between Servants,
and you lost. That's all.

 
**Alexander:**
&mdash;As expected.
Real Heroic Spirits are always so amazing, huh?

 
**Emiya:**
&mdash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, how I enjoyed that... A young man, his trained biceps pushed to the limit... Wonderful!

 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci's being weird...

 
**Emiya:**
Look. She may be real, but look at her. It's fine to worry about where you came from, but stupid to compare it.

 
**Alexander:**
Whatever. Thanks for the nice speech.
In exchange, I'll tell you what you want to know, I guess.

 
**Alexander:**
But all I can really tell you is your next destination.

 
**Alexander:**
There are counterfeit workshops all over the place.
They're spreading fakes of Da Vinci's works little by little.

 
**Alexander:**
But I don't know what her goal is,
not in the slightest!

 
**Alexander:**
Why? Because my job's to be innocent! I haven't been told anything about what goes on behind the scenes.

 
**Alexander:**
I mean, it's not that hard to figure out.
But it would be rude to tell.

 
**Emiya:**
Roger.
I see you're not going to talk no matter what.

 
**Emiya:**
We're in a hurry...but do you need me to finish you off?

 
**Alexander:**
Hmm, nope, I guess.
I hate sympathy.

I don't... Neither does she. I'm a fake, so I'll just disappear when my expiration date arrives.

Hey Roman.
Analyze this homunculus for me, would you?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You always make me do everything, don't you...
Fine, I'll do it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see. This one's different, too.
It's similar to a homunculus, but different.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Another counterfeit, huh...
All right, let's get moving.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Now that we've confirmed this homunculus is a counterfeit, we know we're heading in the right direction.

 
**Hektor:**
Oh, there you are!
Hey, original Heroic Spirits!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Does that mean you're another counterfeit?

 
**Mash:**
You too, Hektor&ndash;

 
**Hektor:**
Well, Servants are basically counterfeits to begin with. So it would make me happy if you would just let me go.

 
**Emiya:**
That's not possible.
You're still spreading the counterfeits.

 
**Hektor:**
Are heroes of justice always this stubborn?

How about it, Master?
I think you're likely to be a bit more flexible.

W-Wow. Wait, where's the “overseas” part coming from?

 
**Emiya:**
Stop it. Delving into vague backstories is a good way to get burned.

 
**Hektor:**
Basically, she wants someone who cares. Someone gentle and sweet, who does whatever she says.

 
**Emiya:**
First Alexander, now this... Seems their Master must be a bit of a spoiled child.

 
**Hektor:**
A spoiled child, huh? But isn't that kind of what makes her adorable?

 
**Hektor:**
When a spoiled child is demanding, it means they're testing your trust. And they're doing that because they're scared.

 
**Hektor:**
Isn't that kind of cute?

Hmm. So a dandy-type Heroic Spirit who spoils you, huh... It works!

That aside, these particular counterfeits are unforgivable!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Look at these Mona Lisas here that just got finished!

 
**Da Vinci:**
What I hate isn't the skill, it's the passion!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Skill-wise, it's still just an inferior copy, but the passion is real. But she's not trying to imitate me!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Instead of putting in the passion to imitate me,
she's starting to put it towards surpassing me!

 
**Hektor:**
Oh, so you noticed, huh?

 
**Emiya:**
Her skills are a little inferior, but when mixed with her passion, they make it seem like the real thing.

 
**Emiya:**
It's the type of counterfeits that you can't just ignore. &ndash;I assume you're ready, Hektor?

 
**Hektor:**
Right, right. I figured this was coming. Well, that's fine.

 
**Hektor:**
I may be a counterfeit, but I'll give it my all!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Hektor:**
Tch... Fine, I lost.
I guess this is as far as a counterfeit can go.

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, Hektor.
You didn't lose because you're a counterfeit.

 
**Da Vinci:**
You lost because you're weak.

 
**Hektor:**
Wow, aren't you harsh!?
But well, that makes me feel better.

 
**Hektor:**
All right, next time I challenge you I'll be stronger.
See ya!

 
**Emiya:**
...Heh. He may joke around, but his spear was sharp and struck hard. Carelessness could have meant our end.

 
**Emiya:**
The way he talks is an important part of his defenses.
That's why the great hero Achilles kept his distance.

 
**Da Vinci:**
A passionate counterfeit...
One that seeks to surpass the original...

 
**Emiya:**
Well, that's what happens if you do it for a while.
Most counterfeiters eventually end up like that.

 
**Emiya:**
They stop making copies, and even trying to become like the original. They try to surpass them.

 
**Emiya:**
I'm not sure who their Master is, but I'm sure her feelings are real.

I can't help it. I'm a counterfeit after all. If the original is humble, I must surpass it with my pride to defeat my opponents.

 
**Siegfried:**
For one thing, isn't it rude to tell someone you're sorry when you're not?

 
**Da Vinci:**
He's right. A very arrogant comment, but he's right!

 
**Da Vinci:**
He's a counterfeit trying to surpass the original, but he's still kind of humble at his core!

 
**Mash:**
I think that's just who Siegfried is!

 
**Siegfried:**
&mdash;I am the strongest dragon, descending on a beach beneath the crescent moon. I have nothing to apologize for.

 
**Siegfried:**
Instead, be bold. Be bolder&mdash;
That's what she whispers to me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
She, huh? Hmm, and it's not like she has something against me, right?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Or actually, I don't think she does. If she hated me, she'd be a little more clingy, or sticky&ndash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. It's best to say that she's dry.

 
**Da Vinci:**
A dried-up fresco. It lasts for a century,
but will never change.

 
**Siegfried:**
...That's why you're the most famous artist in the world. You're very perceptive. I commend you for that.

 
**Siegfried:**
But that doesn't mean I can tell you anything. I'm sor...
No, you're my enemy, so I'm not sorry at all.

 
**Siegfried:**
Kindness towards an enemy can only be shown if you have the strength to spare it, and I do not.

 
**Siegfried:**
Now let's fight, Fujimaru! I've got no real reason to, but I'll stop you with everything I've got!

**Siegfried:**
I tricked you, but I won't apologize!

 
**Siegfried:**
Because it's only natural for a warrior to try and trick his foe.

 
**Siegfried:**
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

 
**Mash:**
He said that with such confidence!
Like “What are you going to do!?”

**Arjuna:**
...It's for her sake. We have no choice.
Also, I would never want to pair up with “that.”

 
**Arash:**
Hmm... I agree.
Quite vexing.

 
**Arash:**
First of all, the fact that it is impossible to communicate is quite a problem.

 
**Arjuna:**
It's not that she can't perceive data from the five senses, it's that she doesn't.

 
**Arjuna:**
It's not that she's blind or deaf, it's that she doesn't try to see or listen.

 
**Arjuna:**
The trouble is that she possesses top-class abilities.

 
**Arash:**
Well, never mind her.
&ndash;It looks like they are still alive.

 
**Arjuna:**
I don't think either of us held back.
...Should we have used our Noble Phantasms?

 
**Arash:**
It's not just that Demi-Servant, Mash! Even that mysterious Archer has a shield-type Noble Phantasm!

 
**Arash:**
It appears we underestimated them.

 
**Arjuna:**
Siegfried's loss is unfortunate.
...I am sorry we dragged him into this.

 
**Arash:**
No. Precisely because he was defenseless, we were able to lure them into this trap. He would've wanted this.

 
**Siegfried:**
...I guess that's it for me.
I leave the rest to you!

I can't believe this. He may be a counterfeit, but to think they would use the great hero Siegfried as bait...

A bowman has many talents.

Careful, Master.
I know who they are.

 
**Emiya:**
One is Arash, a great hero of ancient Persia.

The other is the gifted hero Arjuna,
a legend in India's epic poem the Mahabharata.

 
**Emiya:**
Even if they're counterfeit Heroic Spirits,
they are far more powerful than us.

 
**Mash:**
Arash and Arjuna. Both were Heroic Spirits who lived during the Age of the Gods.

 
**Emiya:**
They're going to attack.
Don't hesitate, Master.

 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;Even after sacrificing Siegfried, we dealt them almost no damage.

 
**Arjuna:**
Nameless Hero. I do not know who you are, but I respect your ability.

 
**Emiya:**
Your strategic error was to try to kill us without using your Noble Phantasms.

 
**Emiya:**
Of course&ndash;Arjuna aside, it's not like Arash can use his Noble Phantasm here.

 
**Arash:**
Hmm, this is quite vexing.
Very vexing.

 
**Arash:**
If I used my Noble Phantasm,
I would make that child so sad!

 
**Arash:**
She gets carried away. When she only means to curse at someone, she spits at them too.

 
**Arash:**
Then she's filled with self-loathing when she realizes that she's made the same mistake again.

 
**Arjuna:**
She may be our Master, but she is quite simple in principle. That's how she will act.

 
**Arjuna:**
Quite undesirable, really.
...I'm the only one who should make her weep.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Counterfeits... “Her”... Hmm.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey, you two.
Can I ask a question?

 
**Arash:**
Oh, and what would that be?
I don't mind answering if it's something I know.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'd like you to tell me about the relationship between you and your Master.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If my speculation is correct,
both of you were assigned a role, yes?

 
**Arjuna:**
...You're quite perceptive.

 
**Arash:**
What was your role again? She was using some kind of slang, like “tsun” or “sadistic” or something like that.

 
**Mash:**
Tsun... Sadistic?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Slang... I think that means...

 
**Arjuna:**
I shall explain my role once and only once.
I am&ndash;

 
**Arjuna:**
“a very sadistic science major upperclassman who gets all lovey-dovey when it matters most.”

However, whether it's for money or some other objective, your Master has been pirating my works.

 
**Arash:**
Hmm... You're a bit off the mark.
But close enough, I suppose.

 
**Arjuna:**
Arash. Isn't this the time to pretend like you know a little less?

 
**Arash:**
It's no big deal. We've done what we're supposed to.

 
**Arash:**
The moment our Master began to forge counterfeits,
she was no doubt aware how it would all turn out.

 
**Arjuna:**
I don't quite agree.

 
**Arjuna:**
Whether Chaldea wants to track down the counterfeits or not, their priority right now should be restoring the Foundation of Humanity.

 
**Arjuna:**
It's unnecessary to solve an issue that wouldn't even turn into a Singularity. In that case... You there, that Master! Won't you make a deal with me?

 
**Arjuna:**
It's clear that we're stronger.
If you withdraw now, we won't attack you.

 
**Arjuna:**
I think it's a fair deal myself.

 
**Mash:**
...Master.

 
**Emiya:**
Fujimaru, it's you who must decide.
We will obey your decision.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Hmm, I guess this is it. It bothers me that so many counterfeits are being circulated...

 
**Da Vinci:**
But it doesn't make any sense to put Fujimaru at risk.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I agree.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sad that my works will remain obscure...
But, I guess it can't be helped!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I mean, humanity is at stake here. If there are no human beings left to appreciate my art, what's the point?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Art is only a visual depiction of this world's phenomena and truths that are already beautiful as they are.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But art is how I make my living. It is the reason for my existence. I was born for art.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So, ultimately, as long as no one interferes with my artistic work, I am content.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If anyone loudly condemns my work to be a sham, I can proudly claim otherwise.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I can say, “I am the one who created this work!”

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Da Vinci...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Emiya:**
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Romani, sorry to be so selfish.
Prepare to Rayshift.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay. Well, I'd expect no less of a conclusion from you, Leonardo.

**Da Vinci:**

**Emiya:**
...You heard that, Da Vinci.
Our Master can be quite reckless.

 
**Mash:**
That's just how Senpai is!

 
**Emiya:**
Either way, I'm not that weak to a point of asking my enemies for mercy. Arash, Arjuna... Ready your bows.

 
**Arash:**
Hah hah hah! Your Master is quite bold. I wish we could provide you with some of our Master's sensitivity.

 
**Arash:**
&ndash;But...a battle is a battle.
We won't hold back.

 
**Arjuna:**
So you don't need mercy from us, huh? Such an endearing fool, but&ndash;you've made a grave mistake.

 
**Arjuna:**
My name is Arjuna.
With this arrow, you will all scatter like a flower's petals!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Arash:**
Ah dammit. I lost...
I didn't think I pulled any punches but...

 
**Arjuna:**
So a counterfeit's utmost effort wasn't enough to defeat an original, huh... No...authenticity isn't the problem here.

 
**Arjuna:**
We lost to you.
And that is all...

 
**Da Vinci:**
I suppose we don't have to run around the world anymore. She's at an art museum, right?

 
**Arash:**
Oh, I'm not about to confess to that!

 
**Arjuna:**
Arash is right. You should find that out yourself.

 
**Arjuna:**
Leonardo da Vinci. History's greatest artist, known worldwide for your works.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Right. I don't want you to meet her.
However, if you do happen to run into her...

 
**Arjuna:**
Witness the truth with your own eyes.

 
**Da Vinci:**
We've come this far.
All that's left is to go meet the boss&ndash;

**Da Vinci:**
...Thanks...for what you did earlier.
Hah, it's kind of awkward to directly thank someone.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't believe I'm seeing this...
Da Vinci...seems...to be...embarrassed!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, do not ruin a nice moment. Please shut up.

 
**Fou:**

**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, you agreed.
You'll see this through with me to the end, right?

 
**Da Vinci:**
...It seems my role this time is to ascertain the authenticity of her works.

 
**Emiya:**
By the way, Da Vinci.
You mentioned an “art museum.” Which one, exactly?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, come on. Surely you know where my Mona Lisa was originally on display, right?

 
**Emiya:**
The Louvre!

 
**Da Vinci:**
If she's not there...
Then I'll give up without complaint!

 
**Mash:**
But for now, let's search thoroughly...

**Emiya:**
A stroll through a museum? How laid-back, Master.
...Well, don't worry about it.

 
**Emiya:**
If you have the time, it'd be good for you to enjoy the art here.

However, nothing on display here is authentic. Although you should still be able to enjoy them since they're well-made duplicates.

Scan complete.
The counterfeits are definitely there.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you continue going straight, be careful.
You'll probably encounter enemies.

Okay.
Let's get started, shall we?

Yes!

Ugh... This malicious aura...

&ndash;Oh, now that's a familiar face.

 
**Mash:**
Gilles de Rais!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, I'm not surprised...
As long as she's there, he'll be with her.

 
**Gilles:**
What are you babbling about!
My name is Gilles de Rais!

 
**Gilles:**
I am “a sad father who was loved by his daughter when she was a kid, but is now hated by her since she became a rebellious teenager!”

I am Gilles de Rais, who gets shooed away with comments like “Dad, you smell like an old person!”

Thank you, sweet young lady!
Oh, if only my daughter had your kindness!

But so it goes. This is also fate... If this is the stage that child envisioned, I must resign myself to that fact.

 
**Emiya:**
...I don't think she had any intention of sharing that information with others...

 
**Emiya:**
Enough. Gilles de Rais, we have nothing to ask of you.

 
**Emiya:**
If you stand in our way,
we will cut you down.

 
**Gilles:**
Oh, is that right?
Hooooooowever!

 
**Gilles:**
Finally, I have a question for you, Master.
Why do you interfere with us!?

If Leonardo da Vinci's counterfeits are a problem,
we'll persuade that child to forge someone else's works.

We have to meet her.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Right.
Marshal Gilles de Rais.

 
**Da Vinci:**
We know her identity.
We simply want to understand her motive.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, it's possible that we already have a rough idea, but...

 
**Da Vinci:**
To go into bouts of fury, despair, and contempt by merely imagining others' motives...

 
**Da Vinci:**
I can't give my approval.

 
**Emiya:**
Agreed.
In any case, we cannot avoid a fight.

 
**Emiya:**
Whatever her purpose is,
it doesn't change the fact that she opposes us.

 
**Emiya:**
No matter how touching her wish is,
we must first defeat her if we are to reason with her.

 
**Gilles:**
...I see. In that case, we shall be your opponents.
For that child's dreams and wishes.

 
**Gilles:**
We seven Servants were created to fulfill them after all.

 
**Gilles:**
Let the counterfeits surpass their originals!
Let falsity overpower truth!

 
**Gilles:**
Even if we're branded as spurious, false, or specious,
we still exist now, in this place!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilles:**
Heh... Sorry, but she's all right.

 
**Gilles:**
She is not a lonely girl who had faith foisted on her and was forced into seclusion.

 
**Gilles:**
She is not a warrior who continues forward, even while bearing wounds that won't heal. She is not a moralizing saint.

 
**Gilles:**
No miracle will happen, no revelation.

 
**Gilles:**
Even though she was just a counterfeit... She's trying to spread her wings out in the world as an individual!

 
**Gilles:**
I dream of the eventual day when we shall meet again somewhere far away. Farewell...

 
**Emiya:**
...Then all that's left are her and one more.

 
**Mash:**
We know who she is.
It's the other one that's the problem.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If I had to guess, I would say someone like Karna.

 
**Emiya:**
Kojirou Sasaki is also a possibility.

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What about Leonidas?

## Section 6: Counterfeit "The Valkyrie Moving Towards The Day After Tomorrow"

...Quiet.
I heard voices.

It seems she hasn't noticed us. Since she's a counterfeit,
she's probably weaker at detecting Servants.

So was your kick an expression of love?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Of course not! Not even close!
Dammit, why is this happening to me!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
All I did was make a simple wish: “Among my seven followers, it would be nice to have a woman.”

**Jeanne Alter:**
But you came faster than I expected. As always, that nose of yours works like a dog, Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
We haven't seen you since Orleans, eh, Jeanne Alter?

 
**Emiya:**
...I thought you were gone for good.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;Ha!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It doesn't matter how twisted my birth was.
Once I exist as a concept, it's impossible to get rid of me.

 
**Emiya:**
...True. Even if something born into this world gets destroyed and disappears...

 
**Emiya:**
The fact that it was born will never be erased.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
As expected, Faker.

 
**Emiya:**
However, that alone shouldn't be enough.

 
**Emiya:**
Gilles de Rais wished for your existence and the Holy Grail made it happen.

 
**Emiya:**
The Holy Grail was recovered and Gilles de Rais was defeated. There was almost zero possibility that you could be summoned again.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Ahahahaha! Yes, you're right, you're absolutely right! The possibility of me being summoned again was infinitesimal.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
After all, nobody wanted me!
The one hero who wished for me was dead!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Except for him, I ruled by brute force,
so no one wanted me brought back!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;So I inverted the idea.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The one woman who would never wish for me, the other half of me whom I hate and despise...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I managed to flip that idiot's wish inside-out, and somehow that's how I was reborn.

 
**Emiya:**
So forceful... It's like a fictional villain materializing into reality.

 
**Emiya:**
It's a rule-breaking technique made possible by the fact that the Heroic Spirit Jeanne d'Arc is unbelievably popular.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Yes, I accept that. I am without a doubt a counterfeit. An abysmal possibility born out of her mercy.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But this world is full of lies. The world approves of the existence of counterfeits. No one says “a counterfeit must not surpass the original!”

 
**Da Vinci:**
Alter... You're dissatisfied as a counterfeit, and want to surpass the original?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's right. I won't repeat the same mistake made in Orleans.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
At the time, I was no more than a machine, made to reject her.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm a counterfeit&ndash; So what!? Want me to hide in the shadows? HAH! Like I would ever do that!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Even if I'm a counterfeit, there are no rules saying I can't make a name for myself in this world!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am Jeanne d'Arc.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Many people imagined that a death like mine warranted vengeance. I'm a witch who fell on account of that.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am, beyond a shred of doubt,
one aspect of Jeanne d'Arc!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am an Anti-Hero born from the dark abyss of murderous intent and hatred... An Avenger-class Servant!

 
**Emiya:**
...Avenger, you say?

 
**Mash:**
She's right. She doesn't fit into any of the seven classes... She's also different than Jeanne's Ruler class!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Get up now, you pervert!

 
**Brynhild:**
Yes! Hahh, hahh, hahh... I've had my fill...

 
**Brynhild:**
And now, I am going to kill you.
Prepare yourselves.

 
**Brynhild:**
This spear will not overlook the fact that you're Big Sister's enemy... Oh, it's also good for giving her acupuncture.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'll never let you give me a massage again!
Look! Look what you did to me!

 
**Emiya:**
That's... Hm. I was going to keep my mouth shut, but let me correct you.

 
**Emiya:**
Listen, Holy Maiden of Vengeance.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Wh-What do you want?
Talking like that, you must be a womanizer.

 
**Emiya:**
Hahaha. All right, now I won't hold anything back.

 
**Emiya:**
You summoned seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits.
No, you made them.

 
**Emiya:**
That was revenge for Orleans, yes?
But this time, your wishes are mixed in there.

 
**Emiya:**
Why are most of the counterfeit Heroic Spirits handsome men? Why didn't you rely on your general, Gilles?

 
**Emiya:**
The answer is clear. You just haven't realized it yourself. Deep inside that consciousness is a desire to be the protagonist!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Nonsense! If that's the case, how do you explain this perverted woman!?

 
**Brynhild:**
What... Perverted? What a passionate comment... (Blush)

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Die of dehydration!

 
**Brynhild:**
Aaah! Love is painfully hot!

Um... Even I understand.

 
**Mash:**
I'm sure you just wanted “an honest friend who's the same sex as you” right?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**

**Jeanne Alter:**
...Annoying.
You people are truly annoying.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am a lone Avenger. The counterfeits are only pawns. If I don't like them, I will crush them without a second thought.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Come at me. I will show you even a counterfeit can surpass the original!

 
**Emiya:**
Here she comes. Your orders, please, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Emiya:**
Somehow we managed to take down Brynhild, but...

 
**Mash:**
Right. Jeanne Alter is still a threat!

 
**Emiya:**
We just need one more push.
You can do it, Master!

 
**Brynhild:**
...I failed. Master, sorry I couldn't be of use to you...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Don't worry about it.
I could tell from watching your struggle up close.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Your lack of ability is my responsibility.
I wasn't able to summon you into a proper form.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Why don't you blame me before you die, like the others?

 
**Brynhild:**
Well, heh-heh.
You still don't get it, do you, Master?

 
**Brynhild:**
&ndash;I enjoyed myself.
I had so much fun.

 
**Brynhild:**
We're counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We've been able to indulge in the vice, masochism, and folly that our true personalities never could.

 
**Brynhild:**
Thanks to you, Master, I've had a ridiculously good time.

 
**Brynhild:**
You gave us so much pleasure.
Why would we blame you?

 
**Brynhild:**
The emotions you gave us, the fictional backstory... they're no more than a starting point.

 
**Brynhild:**
We began there,
and fell in love with you along the way.

 
**Brynhild:**
It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.
Goodbye, Big Sister&ndash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
So one left, huh?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, how do you think we should solve this commotion?

It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.
Goodbye, Big Sister&ndash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...
Humph. What a joke.

 
**Emiya:**
It sounded to me like she was being honest.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's a joke. I created the seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits as pawns for my amusement.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
They have no respect, affection, or trust.
After all, we came into this world as fakes.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Sigh. Even with your back against the wall,
you haven't realized your true feelings. Unbelievable.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Dark Jeanne d'Arc. Let's set aside counterfeit paintings and sculptures.

 
**Da Vinci:**
As far as counterfeit Heroic Spirits go, you're on the right track. You said your goal was to surpass the original...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...but you've already created counterfeits that surpass the originals.

 
**Da Vinci:**
After all, the originals are bound by their sense of heroism. Fujimaru, don't you agree?

They all looked like they were having a good time.
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...
...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What are you talking about, “a good time?”
Don't make me laugh. It couldn't have been fun.

None of them complained.
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Ridiculous. What are you saying?
They must have felt bitter.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I summoned them by force, but wasn't satisfied,
so I even altered their parameters.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
They may have acted as my subordinates on the surface, but must have despised me on the inside!

 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Listen, I'm Leonardo da Vinci,
creator of many original works.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Do you think I can't tell whether something is genuine or fake? They sincerely enjoyed themselves.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well more than the original Servants at that.
They had concern for and deeply cared about you.

 
**Da Vinci:**
What Fujimaru said is important, too.
This is a Master who has been through many scenes of bloodshed.

 
**Da Vinci:**
[♂ He /♀ She] said it best. There was nothing false about those counterfeit Heroic Spirits.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Look, even if you don't believe me,
you can believe Fujimaru, can't you?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I don't know. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!
I don't understand any of this!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I mean... There's nothing lovable about me!
I have no charm! I'm a helplessly twisted little girl!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
All I have is power, so much so you want to throw up! But can you blame me!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's all I have! I'm driven to seek revenge and it's all that I have!

 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;Yes. That's okay, isn't it?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Huh?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Whether you're lovable or charming or worthy of being a Servant...

 
**Da Vinci:**
You've given a lot of thought to those things, but your conclusion is confusing.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Since long ago, you've understood.
You're a girl who burns with vengeance.

 
**Da Vinci:**
You should have gone big with that wicked power of yours. You should have become an Anti-Hero.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And then you should've been summoned here like that, as a Servant.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Humph. After all this time, I wouldn't have the nerve&ndash;

Don't you need any processing time?
Are you a calculator?

 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Whether you're a Heroic Spirit or an Anti-Hero, Fujimaru is the perfect five-star Master.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So, what are you going to do?

...It's my loss.

 
**Emiya:**
You admit defeat?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I will admit my defeat, with one exception.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I admit to an inferiority complex over that Holy Maiden.
I admit to a craving to be sought after.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I admit to having smoldering hatred in my heart even now.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And I admit that no matter how much success I achieve, how many lives I save&mdash; I'll always be an Avenger who is never satisfied.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But even so, with all the sins this hopeless Avenger has committed,

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
if you still wish for this strength, this flag of hatred, I will respond to your summon, last Master of the world.

 
**Mash:**
Master... You did it!

Then let's go ho&ndash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Now, let's begin our final battle to the death!

 
**Mash:**
H-Huh!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What? Demi-Servant, why are you looking at me with wide eyes? We're going to fight.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? But...
Didn't you just surrender!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;No, I did no such thing. Don't tell me you thought I would just go off to Chaldea with you?

 
**Mash:**
I-I did. Or at least I don't think a duel to the death is necessary.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It is. After all, you people defeated my pawns.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
As the one who stands above all counterfeit Heroic Spirits, I will never back down from a fight. I will fight with all my strength. That's nonnegotiable.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
After all&mdash; I'm an exceptionally wicked Heroic Spirit. You think I'd let someone who defied me get away so easily?

 
**Emiya:**
...Sheesh. Just what we need.
Somebody with pride in being an evil leader.

 
**Emiya:**
Only one thing to do.
Give up and fight, Master.

 
**Emiya:**
But look at the bright side.
This will be our last fight with her.

But...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru.
I mean Master.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you already realize this.
She needs this fight more than anyone.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If we blew it off here, she would have a lifelong grudge against you.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I mean... Put it this way. Scary as she is, you would hate for that to happen, right?

**Jeanne Alter:**
Oui.
Yes, that's it. That impudent expression!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
How many times did I want to make you kneel in Orleans?! How many times did I want to trample you!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;It's time to hit the dirt, originals!

 
**Mash:**
!!!
Here come the remaining enemies too!

 
**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight, ready for combat!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Ahhh, that wasn't enough, huh?
But that's okay.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It was fun, just like that horror movie woman said.
I had a lot of fun!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's why this story and I shall end here.

...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Ahhh, this is so vexing!
But that's fine.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The future me will form a bond with you. The current me will have a hearty laugh and go off into the sunset.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm sure the future me won't have any memories of being a counterfeit Heroic Spirit.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So the current me at least wanted to make one last memory&ndash; So I wouldn't be lonely.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I guess it's about time.
Good. You've embarrassed me enough.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You'd better take full responsibility...
Goodbye.

 
**Mash:**
Master. We've recovered a fragment of the Holy Grail.

 
**Mash:**
Just as Elisabeth retrieved a Holy Grail fragment back in Orleans...

 
**Mash:**
...it seems Jeanne Alter also obtained a fragment from somewhere.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Her elimination is confirmed.
Now there's no more danger of counterfeit proliferation.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good work. You can come back now. Although you could also retrieve the remaining counterfeits.

 
**Emiya:**
Master, you were right. Sometimes there are people who just need to be defeated.

 
**Emiya:**
There are people who can't admit defeat and move on until it's too late.

 
**Emiya:**
She had to be defeated precisely because she has gained the qualification to be summoned as a Servant.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, that's right. There are people in this world who need to be defeated before they can move forward.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, shall we go home? For a shut-in like me, the turmoil this time was a lot to bear!

 
**Mash:**
I think you should get some exercise once in a while, Da Vinci, instead of tinkering with your strange inventions all the time.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh? I use an exercise bike in my room so I don't particularly need more exercise than this.

 
**Emiya:**
Why, I got a clear understanding of just how athletic you are. To think you were good at close combat...

 
**Emiya:**
As soon as we get back, King Leonidas and I will come up with a training menu to make you fit enough to stand on the front line.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I don't want a total muscle-building menu!
If I get muscles, I'll lose this golden ratio!

 
**Emiya:**
Don't worry. A little training and we'll send you to the front. I bet you're looking forward to that day, Master.

I'm not ready to go anywhere!

Unless something dire happens, I'm not going to the front! Keep that in miiiiiiind!
