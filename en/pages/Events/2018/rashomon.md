# The Demonic Capital Rashomon

## Opening Act: Heian Sakura Front Line
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Rayshift complete.
We've arrived in Japan, Master.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And it seems you got there safely. Sorry if the ride was bumpy, Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
As if to be expected, I'm not getting a clear visual of you. This time it's even worse than normal.

 
**Mash:**
I'm guessing you can't pinpoint the cause?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. There are times when you travel so far back that we don't have enough data on that era...but that's not the case here.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This observation impediment doesn't follow any pattern we've seen before. It's like someone is jamming our signal.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, the fact remains that I'm picking up very unusual responses from that era. It's bound to turn into a Singularity if we leave it alone.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why I sent you two to check it out.
For starters, what are your surroundings like?

 
**Mash:**
Right. Well, it's safe here. I mean, we've never been to a place this idyllic. Especially, um...

 
**Mash:**
The cherry blossoms are lovely.
Just beautiful.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Cherry blossoms, huh? That's nice. I've seen them before, too. Although I didn't get to have a viewing party...

 
**Mash:**
...On top of that, there's a kind of sweet aroma...all around... Mm...

Wait, could this scent be...
 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm... An aroma you say... I wonder what it could be. We definitely need more information.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
My estimate is that you're in the Heian era right now. That said, the Heian era lasted for nearly 400 years.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Stand by while I try to pinpoint your exact coordinates. Please keep an eye on your surroundings.

 
**Mash:**
Understood. Still...
I can't get over how beautiful it is here.

I can't get over how beautiful you are, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
 
R-Right... As you can see, my primary colors are purple and black... So I am no match for the beautiful pink of cherry blossoms.

I wish we had some dumplings from the moon festivals.
 
**Mash:**
Hehe. Shhh, Senpai.
Caesar will appear if you bring that up again.

 

 
**Mash:**
But... Ummm. Actually, this has been bothering me since we got here...

 
**Mash:**
There's a big pile of petals over there, but it's human-shaped.

 
**Mash:**
It's as if someone fell asleep while viewing the cherry blossoms and was left behind for a full day...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ah&mdash;chooo! Ahhh, what, morning already!? Daaammit!

 
**Mash:**
K-Kintoki!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, if I just do this and voila... Huh?
Hey, I'm picking up a Servant in your proximity.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Going by the powerful magical energy reading... No doubt about it, it's a musclehead Servant with a suffocating presence!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Doctor. Mr. Golden, Sakata Kintoki himself is right in front of us.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, Kintoki is there.
That would explain this strength level I'm seeing.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, what's he doing there!?
Did you two bring him along!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oooh, my head hurts... I went overboard brawling with those bears...

To be golden in the morning is very golden!

God morning, Kintoki.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
O-Oh, that's a strange mangling of the language.
“God morning” sounds a little ominous.

 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
At any rate, it's good to start off with a greeting.
It shows you have good manners.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A fulfilling day begins with a nice greeting, a nice breakfast, and nice wood-chopping.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My boss... Oh, I don't mean you.
My former boss, or I guess more like my foster parent...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Boss Raikou, you know?
She lived around here.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
She was usually lax, but very serious about table manners. Even bad sitting posture would earn a demonic glare.

 
**Mash:**
Um, Kintoki. My apologies for interrupting, but would you tell us what you're doing here?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, sorry. I slipped into reminiscing about the olden days. But the reason I'm here&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Whoa, wait. Don't get too close.

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(I'm the one just waking up here... And even though I'm the man they called the Beast of Ashigara...)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(Dangerous... she's the true dangerous beast!
I mean, look at her outfit!)

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, he won't look me in the eye.
Does he hate me now?

Dangerous... beast!
 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No, it's not your fault, young lady.
In fact, I would compliment you, if you were a man.

 
**Mash:**
H-Huh? Thank you... I think?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, you even bow to me?!
Then I gotta man up... Here we go...

 
**Mash:**
K-Kintoki!? Oh no, Senpai, Kintoki is punching himself hard in the cheek!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All right, that woke me up!
So, shall we get going, Boss!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I wouldn't call it a world crisis, but there's trouble in my neck of the woods.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Deep in the mountains, somebody called.
I don't know who it is, but I'm goin' there.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All the signs point to good things, so I'll push on ahead. My axe will carve a way through the mountains. Make way for this thunderclap!

**Mash:**
That said... Where are we going?

**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh? Where are we going? Why, that's obvious.
It's&mdash;

 
**???:**
 
Gyaaaaooooo&mdash;!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Aaaah! A hostile response already!
Is it&ndash;a wild beast?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Your ambush is well-timed&mdash;! But I don't think I've seen you around these parts before!

 
**Mash:**
It seems to see us as food.
It's charging!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is also a perfect way to start the day.
A nice warm-up! Let's go wild, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good work.
I've finally got your coordinates now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
North latitude 35 degrees, east longitude 135 degrees 45 minutes approximately. The cultural and political center of Japan in this era.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words, if you go down that mountain&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
There's only one place with a sky and cherry blossoms like this. We stand before Kyoto.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's Kyo&ndash; He stole my line! I shouldn't have started off with the latitude and longitude!

 
**Mash:**
It's okay, Doctor.

 
**Mash:**
Someday we may have to take a geography test with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.

 
**Mash:**
When that happens, this information should come in handy. Thank you very much.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, you can be rather brutal sometimes...
Okay, one more piece of new info.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You were just talking about an aroma, right?
I got curious, so I analyzed it...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's ethanol mixed in with the air.
Fruits and crops fermented using yeast.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words, alcohol. What you're smelling is wine.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The smell of wine, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Kintoki? You seem like a guy who can hold his drink.
Bad memories or something?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I've never heard of anything good happening when alcohol was involved.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's true. It's usually stories of someone getting drunk and embarrassing themselves!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...That's right.
Jeez, I've got a golden bad feeling about this.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Enough about drinking.
I've located the point of the abnormality too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ignore what we can't understand for now, and head there as planned to investigate it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why you're here, right, Kintoki?
But when did you use the Rayshift?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh? Boss was the one who called me, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I just found myself here all of a sudden! I was bored, so I trained with a bear, slept, and then it was morning.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hmm? So you were forcibly summoned there.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah. Looks like there's more to it, but the details don't matter. Boss, you need more people, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Then leave it to me! As you can see, I've got more strength than I know what to do with!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thanks, that's a big help.
Take care and proceed.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is a bad mist.
Smoke on the whatsits, you know?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's a bit of a ways till you get to the source.
What's the situation where you're at?

 
**Mash:**
It looks like we're in a residential district near Kyoto... But something seems strange...

 
**Kyoto Resident:**
Hahahaha! Ahahahaha!
Food! Drink! Bring more!

 
**Kyoto Resident:**
You rotten fiend! I never liked the way you married your childhood friend! Now let's celebrate!

 
**Kyoto Resident:**
I like you. I love you! Take me! Take me now!
Take me to paradise! Huh? You're married? Then die!

Some kind of weird festival?
 

 
**Mash:**
To be honest, I don't understand what's going on. Everyone seems to be doing something different.

 
**Mash:**
Everybody's getting excited about their own thing...
What is going on here?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A lot of them are saying some rough stuff, but they're still sane. It's fine until the blades come out, but...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Did you notice?
It's getting thicker.

 
**Mash:**
There's no telling what will happen.
Senpai, we need to be more careful than ever.

 
**Mash:**
The cherry blossoms are as pretty as ever but&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...
...

 
**Mash:**
Huh!? Senpai, watch out!
(Squeeze)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's wrong? What happened!?
An enemy attack?

**Mash:**
Whew. That was close.
A cherry blossom petal fell on Senpai's head.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai has an important duty to perform.
I can't let anything threaten that.

 
**Mash:**
I, Mash Kyrielight, want to help Senpai.
More, more, more. More.

 
**Mash:**
So&ndash;Huh!? Look at that foul-smelling mystery trap!
It may be an enemy Noble Phantasm! Get back! (Squeeze-squeeze)  
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No, that's just a fertilizer pit.
if you fall in, you're gonna regret it.

 
**Mash:**
...Oh? Senpai, your face is a little red.
Do you have a fever? ...No, perhaps a cold?

 
**Mash:**
Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?
Do you want headpats?

 
**Mash:**
Come to think of it, you were sleeping with your stomach exposed this morning.

 
**Mash:**
But don't worry. It's okay now that I'm here.
I'll sleep next to you tonight.

 
**Mash:**
With my Noble Phantasm I can keep you safe from cold viruses, as well as nasty cedar pollen!

 
**Mash:**
I can shut out all nasty insects and external enemies completely!

Hmm? Wait a second. Is this...
I see. I knew it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way, how about you, Kintoki?
Anything seem off with you?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No need to worry.
I'm always golden.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Actually, I feel stronger!
I feel like I'm overflowing with energy!

 
**Mash:**
Did you hear that, Senpai? Mr. Golden is filled with too much energy, he says. Scary, huh?

 
**Mash:**
But don't worry. Even if he approaches you with a sexual proposition,

 
**Mash:**
my shield will deploy to secure you with incredible speed.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
No, I'm not that kind of guy...

No, this time it's worse than usual.
 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, well... This is extremely hard to say, but...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm seeing a slight change on her vitals.
She's drunk.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Drunk? Just on this aroma?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. It doesn't seem to be affecting you, though.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's because of the alcohol that's permeating the air. That's what's gotten into the people around you, too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoever breathes it in gets drunk.
That's why they're all acting like that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
How about you, Fujimaru?
Anything seem strange?

I've never been drunk, so I don't know.
 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. Maybe the protective power that Mash should have is being transferred to her Master?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Still, that's the right thing for the moment. No matter how drunk she is, Mash will follow Fujimaru's orders.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If Fujimaru went nuts, we'd have a golden disaster on our hands.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Senpai! Stop spending so much time talking with the Doctor, and let's go. We have a ways to walk.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Guess we'll have to keep going.
Though my bad feeling keeps getting worse... Huh?

 
**Kyoto Resident:**
 
Yahoo! A bunch o' fresh country bumpkins!

 
**Kyoto Resident:**
Leave all your valuables!

 
**Mash:**
I will not!
Senpai's going with me!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, we'll eliminate this obstacle.
Let's do it together!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's strange about this is that she seems normal at first glance...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is there a reason they're getting drunk like this?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tch... It stinks.
I mean, there are good drinks and bad drinks.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And this is a really bad one.
It ain't something a person should be drinking.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Harder to reach you...
All I can manage is audio... Be careful...

 
**Mash:**
It's strange. We should be getting closer to central Kyoto, but&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
It feels so empty. I don't see a single person.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? Kyoto was the center of Japan in that era.
There can't just be no one there&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
But it's true. I'll add that there are several corpses lying on the side of the road.

 
**Mash:**
It seems clear that something's going up ahead.
...Mr. Golden, you know Kyoto well, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, I guess. But this is different.
This ain't the Kyoto I know.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Kyoto's a golden city.
The atmosphere, the people, even the laughter shines.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's normal and natural in Kyoto. That's why in the future that amazing, cool golden temple is gonna be built.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(He's probably talking about the Kinkaku... Rokuon-ji...)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't like it.
This dead, alcohol-stinking air ain't Kyoto.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Drinks are for warming up the heart.
It ain't something to melt the marrow of your bones.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Tch. I don't want to remember it,
but this alcohol is&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, I see a big gate.
Is it past this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Yes...but...be careful...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh! What is this? A dragonkin!?
Everyone, be extremely careful&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Ah! I see something near the gate, Master!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...And to think I thought this was just a lot of fun. Pathetic. I feel pathetic.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Poison, miasma, hedonism, and decadence, all mixed up. That means only one thing.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That ain't a bunch of little things mixed together.
It's the real aura of an oni.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Haha!
Bwahahahaha!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And there you are, Ibaraki-Douji!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I wondered who it was. Haha!
Who does it turn out to be but Sakata Kintoki!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It's been so damn long! So long!
You alone? Where's Raikou? Where's Tsuna?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You've got eyes, don't you?
But you... You ain't alone, are ya?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tell me. What is that?
What is that thing floating behind you?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hah! This is my master, and my sacrifice!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Our fallen leader of the oni clan, Shuten-Douji!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwaha! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
&mdash;!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hah! Ticked off, huh?
Even behind that strange blindfold I can tell!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Your eyes are shining with a burning light.
That must've ticked you off, huh?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&mdash;Humph. But I am even more displeased than you. Would the likes of you really care about Shuten?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
After you tricked her and slew her? Why would you care about Shuten when I am about to eat her?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You idiot! I ain't worried! I don't care what you do!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If you're gonna fight each other, do it somewhere else! And anyway&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You have any idea how dangerous that wench is?
After you eat her she'll devour you from the inside out!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&ndash;Humph. That's right.
The old me wouldn't have been able to defeat her.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But you know what?
&mdash;Race forward, Sougenbi!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Gwaah!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...What ...happened...?

 
**Mash:**
Some huge flaming thing just flew out and blew Kintoki away!

 
**Mash:**
And... now it's coming back!
That's... That's...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tch. Is that...your arm?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Indeed. Indeed! Indeed! Indeed! This is my arm of destruction! I call it the Great Grudge of Rashomon!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
She's got a damn rocket punch!
I thought Tsuna hacked that thing off!

 
**Mash:**
No way... That's a Noble Phantasm. She's using her own severed arm as a Noble Phantasm&ndash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwahahaha! Little girl! Little girl! Little girl!
Have you ever seen anything like me?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Then carve this into your mind, so you'll have something to remember as the maggots eat your guts!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Raging like a beast! Terrifying like a god!
Frivolous like an insect!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We know not the weakness of mankind, nor the pride of a warrior! We use our own rotted arms as weapons!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That is what an oni is. We are man-eating monsters, who inspire fear by our very presence!

 
**Mash:**
Ugh!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...They're speaking to me.
Yes, someone, somewhere, is saying it.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&ndash;Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour&ndash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Devour mankind. Devour you!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You are human. Flesh for me to eat.
You are Sakata Kintoki, my mortal enemy.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And I am Ibaraki-Douji.
The ruler of all the oni on Mt. Ooe!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And thus... You shall not leave this place alive!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Stupid. Ibaraki's even stupider than last time.

 
**Mash:**
You know her, Kintoki?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah. She's just an animal that doesn't like people.
We don't get along.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But she wasn't that bad.
She used to follow the laws of the food chain...

 
**Mash:**
But now she's not... She's an oni killing people for no reason, not just to survive?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yup. That's what she's become.
And that puts her in my jurisdiction.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I see you've got some yummy kids with you!
They can fill my belly too!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Sure, bring it, little oni!
I'll smash that big arm of yours into tiny pieces!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That's my line, you wannabe westerner!
I'll eat your bones along with Shuten!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(That oni girl screwed up big... Isn't Mt. Ooe yours, fool?)

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Aah, aah&ndash; A lovely wind is blowing.
It smells of guts and blood and alcohol.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It is the smell of the demonic city that I desire!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm so happy, Kintoki.
Soon&ndash;the smell of your guts will be mixed in with it too!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwaha! Bwahahahaha!

 
**Mash:**
Her murderous intent is incredible...
She's coming, Master! Get ready to fight!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Right. One warning, Boss.
that ain't the Ibaraki I know.

She might be strong enough that you could throw all your Servants at her and have a 50/50 chance.

I knew it! Her lines are really...something!
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Nah, she was always like that.
That hasn't changed a bit.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But she's a lot stronger!
A helluva lot stronger than the Ibaraki I knew!

 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyway, this is good stuff!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The little oni who hid in Shuten's shadow has grown up to reach the level of a god!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A worthy opponent! Let's go, Boss!
Time for some golden oni hunting!

 
## Chase Battle: Back From Zero
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tch! She's fierce!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwahaha! Bwahaha! This is exciting!
It's so exciting, huh, Kintoki?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
If you grab a man he snaps in two.
Pat him and you'll split him open!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But battling you is like wrestling a mountain!
And this won't stop till one of us is dead!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It would be boring to let this end so soon.
Time to take a break!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I won't let you go, idiot!
Blow 'em away, Golden&ndash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwaha! Don't be in such a hurry!
Don't be in such a hurry! Our banquet continues!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwahahaha!

 
**Mash:**
She ran beyond the gate so quickly... She's so fast.

 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry, Mr. Golden. We're badly damaged as well. We've used too much energy.

 
**Mash:**
It feels very dangerous to pass through the gate like this...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, you're right.
Sorry, this wasn't just my fight, was it?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Fine. We'll come back tomorrow.
Let's eat something while we can.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Even with Kyoto in this state, there's gotta be a place to eat. I recommend some golden mash and golden pastries.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Get some energy stored up. Oni are greedier than any other creature, and there's no telling what they'll do.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This might end up being a much longer fight than you're expecting.

 
## Chase Battle: Drunkenness and Relaxation
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwahahaha!
This is such fun! Such fun!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It ain't fun for you!
Your eyes aren't laughing at all!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&ndash;Humph. Don't insult me.
I'm just not used to laughing.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
To laugh from the bottom of one's heart, huh...
I can't do it like Shuten.

 
**Mash:**
She got away again...

 
**Mash:**
But I could tell we were hitting her.
We're wearing her down, I think.

 
**Mash:**
Let's just stay calm and be careful.

**Mash:**
Let's retreat a little and make camp.
That should let us talk to the Doctor as well.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm... Got it. Thanks for the report.
Just keep it up and don't let your guard down.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry. There's just so much static near the gate that I can't analyze anything or communicate with you.

Dinner's ready, Senpai! We're having what Mr. Golden requested, golden rice balls.

 
**Mash:**
Since we're on the battlefield, it's curry-flavored! Everyone loves curry! But unfortunately your fingers get a little sticky.

 
**Mash:**
There's only one way to deal with this.
Open wide, Senpai!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-Yeah... The same, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If she's normal during combat, and near that gate,

maybe she's just barely keeping it under control when she's near danger, perhaps?

**Dr. Roman:**
W-Well, I'm just glad it's not interfering with the battle.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know what's going on, but clearly, there's some kind of alcohol in the air there.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Until we can deal with the root cause, it won't go away.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You'll have to make the best of what you've got.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, right. I did come up with a plan.
Something I wanted you to try when you had the time...

 
## Chase Battle: Alcoholic Fog in the Demonic Capital

They got away again.

...No. Considering our injuries and fatigue&ndash;
I guess we dealt a fair amount of damage.

(So you were listening to our conversation?)

 
**Mash:**
Our goal is to resolve whatever's causing the abnormalities that exist in this place.

 
**Mash:**
At the moment, it's clear that our biggest problem is the oni that lives by this gate&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
But maybe we don't necessarily have to defeat it.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You want to turn a blind eye to it?
That doesn't seem like a golden idea...

 
**Mash:**
No, I'm not saying we should turn a blind eye to it.

 
**Mash:**
But say that Ibaraki-Douji's power comes from this “source” beyond the gate&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
In which case, it would make more sense to wipe that out first. That's what I meant.

 
**Mash:**
For instance, by climbing over the gate rather than under it. Or maybe we could find a way to go around it...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ahh, so that's what you meant.
Then your objective makes sense, but...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We couldn't possibly climb over the gate.
Look at its top.

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. I did see that too.

 
**Mash:**
There's a sinister, thick, fog-like, cloudy-looking something that's hanging over the gate and wall.

 
**Mash:**
I don't know what it is, but I'm willing to bet it's something bad.

 
**Mash:**
There's no telling what it would do even to a Servant if they tried to touch it...

So how about finding a detour?
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master. Let's check the area again for possible detours before we stop to rest for the night.

 

 
**Mash:**
Even if we can't climb over the gate or the enclosing fences, if there's some other path to the other side...

 
**Mash:**
Maybe our prospects will look better...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Doesn't seem like there's anything.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Basically, it seems the heart of Kyoto is surrounded on all sides by that poisonous fog-looking substance.

 
**Mash:**
That said... Now that we're seeing the west end of the city for the first time, I've just realized...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
There's a freakin' humongous cliff here for some reason. I almost can't believe it, but there it is.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This era... I mean, this Japan right now, must have shrunken or something. Or should I say the islands have been squashed?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The topography is crazy. Unexpectedly the ocean is up against Kyoto's west side...

 
**Mash:**
...Right. It does look like there's something like an island beyond that fog, but since we don't have a boat...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't dislike this golden sense of scale, though.
But it looks like there's no way to make that detour.

 
**Mash:**
You're probably right. It seems... that we do need to beat Ibaraki-Douji in order to proceed.

Yes, Master.
She retreats with astonishing agility.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Whenever I see her arm, I'm reminded against my will.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
When Tsuna's sword Higekiri chopped off her arm, she still escaped before he could deal the finishing blow.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
These aren't just flukes.
It must be some kind of ability.

 
**Mash:**
Maybe she has the “Disengage” skill.
That would be very bothersome.

 
**Mash:**
By the way, Mr. Golden, what you just said makes me wonder something. Did you know her while you were alive too?

Only her battle habits. We fought quite a few times.

Did you know the captured oni... Shuten-Douji, too?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Aaah, well, yeah.
...She was the same as Ibaraki, I guess. Yeah.

 
**Mash:**
Were the two of them friends?
Or, were they more like boss and subordinate?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ibaraki was the boss of all the oni on Mt. Ooe. Shuten also apparently lived there, as a freeloader&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But Ibaraki treated her as her superior, saying Shuten had something she lacked.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
In terms of ranking within the oni clan, they were equals. But that was based solely on Ibaraki's decree...which caused the kinds of problems you'd expect.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But I do get where Ibaraki was coming from. That Shuten... She was, I guess you can say, a coward in a lot of ways.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And she was wicked to the core. But she was honestly good to those she'd formed a kind of bond with.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I thought she was a spirit of caprice and mischief in the form of an oni, but she's also chivalrous, dutiful, and humane.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, she was a natural-born leader, that Shuten-Douji. Though she caused plenty of trouble for her subordinates.

 
**Mash:**
I see, I see.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And just what the hell are you smiling about, huh?

 
**Mash:**
I beg your pardon. You just seemed oddly gentle while you were saying all that.

 
**Mash:**
But that boss oni is now being held prisoner by Ibaraki-Douji.

 
**Mash:**
She seemed to be completely out cold too.
I wonder what happened...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Who knows? Maybe Ibaraki finally ran out of patience with her.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oni will always be demonic.
And I'll hunt them down. That's all there is to it.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm heading out. If you all want to rest, then go on and rest already.

 
## Chase Battle: Shuten's Memories
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu. Just what are you staring at, boy?
Well, not that it's any bother to me to be stared at.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...I'm not staring. You're standing where I'm facing.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu. What a mean human you are...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now, shall we begin? I've lost count of how many times we've clashed at this point.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
My signature weapon is lacking its best bits...
Would you forgive me?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
If it were to clash head-on with that battle-axe of yours, it'd be such exquisite fun, such exquisite pleasure...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I'm not fond of pointless battle, you see.
I'll take you down with sensuality, not by brute force.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But, well, we're only in this situation because it doesn't seem to work on you, right?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh dear, oh dear. If I can't de-bone you with desire for me without lopping off your head, I'll lose self-confidence.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But I suppose it's hopeless.
After all... you like fighting way more, isn't that right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
&mdash;It is.
That's what I want. That's all I need.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oni are evil. That's what you are to me, Shuten.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
So you say. But I thought I saw you take pity on another oni before me and let her slip away?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Really, I'm quite furious now.
De-boning you won't be enough to satisfy me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's it! I'll rip out your bones and then use my metal rod to torment you. And with that, we'll erase all the history we've shared till now.

**Sakata Kintoki:**
&mdash;Tch.
Did I wake you? Sorry.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I let my guard down too. I dozed off and you saw a pathetic comedy from long ago.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But yeah... I've crossed paths with Shuten a number of times.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
When we've fought for real, we always end in a draw. When we've sparred for fun or for a bet, we always end in a draw.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I guess we'd both got it in our heads that we'd found an opponent we were dead even with...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Boss Raikou called me out on it, asked what I thought I was doing, striking up a rivalry with an oni.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Boss was the one who served Shuten drugged wine, which put all the oni to sleep.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You know how the rest of the story goes. I snuck up behind Shuten as she slept and decapitated her.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And yet, that wretch...
Even as she was dying, she gave me a little grin.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
“Guess I'll go a bit ahead of you, 'kay?” she murmured. Like she was enjoying her life to the very last.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Jeez. She really was quite a woman, actually.
Even now, that never felt like a victory to me.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
And, so... That's why I can't stomach the idea that she is being controlled by Ibaraki now.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'll take on Ibaraki since she's an oni, but as a victim of Shuten's annoying antics, I can't ignore this.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
At the end, I'm just venting my own anger!
You don't need to worry about it, Master.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This fight is finally drawing to a close.
It's time I gave her a proper thrashing!

 
## Chase Battle: Ibaraki's Obstinacy
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Urgh... Arrgh!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's a bitter pill to swallow, isn't it, Boss-Lady?
Time to pay the toll!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Not...not yet.

 
Do you think I am so easily slain!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You should know better than that, you fool!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No matter how many swords pierce us, no matter how many spears impale us...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We do not stop.
Not until we've had our fill.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We are the apex of this filthy existence... and, because we continually devour the souls of others, the embodiment of life!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That&ndash;is what an oni truly is!

 
**Mash:**
Ugh... This heat...!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
My Inferno Fist has obliterated entire armies&mdash;
May it burn the flesh from your bones!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
&mdash;Blaze, Sougenbi!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!
Are you trying to burn yourself up too, bastard?!

 
**Mash:**
Her Noble Phantasm's deployed!

 
**Mash:**
...Whew. We managed to defend ourselves through that attack, but... it looks like Ibaraki-Douji got away.

 
**Mash:**
I can't believe she could summon up so much latent power...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, that was basically her last rally.
She won't be able to summon any more of those flames.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
She saves that Noble Phantasm for last, not to destroy her opponent, but to give her cover under which she can run away.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's why she can't win against Shuten.
She acts like a ruffian, but deep down, she's submissive.

 
**Mash:**
Ahh. Well, then... What about Shuten?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
She's the exact opposite of Ibaraki. She looks refined on the surface, but she's a true oni inside.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But never mind that now.
We're finally close to finishing this, Boss.

 
**Mash:**
Agreed. We've all been pushing through our accumulating fatigue...

Now get blown away! Eat this&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Golden Spark!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
Urghh, aaaaaauuughhhh!

 
**Mash:**
We... We did it!

 
**Mash:**
She had so much stamina I wondered if it was inexhaustible, but...at last! That was a fatal hit!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Why? Why were you able to follow me this far?!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I stand above all the oni! Humans should not be able to slay me, even if you are Heroic Spirits!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Don't be ridiculous, Ibaraki.
You're not above anything.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're just a child pretending to be.
You lacked the guts you needed to the very end.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
How dare you! How could any part of me be deemed lacking!?

I respect Shuten and haven't hurt so much as a hair upon her head, you fools! In the first place, I'd be too afraid to! She'd slaughter me!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
See? Told you this was how Ibaraki was, right?

What a chicken...
 

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Y-You little wretch, I don't know what you called me, but I can sense that it was some kind of dreadful insult. Wasn't it, human!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What part of me do you dare to call weak!?
Speak your name, knave!

It's Fujimaru.
 

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
All right, I've memorized it. I've memorized your name, human! I shall curse it to the end of time! Writhe in mortal terror!

 
**Mash:**
...Saying all that was perhaps a bit counter-productive... All the terror I felt for you before has been reversed. Right, Senpai?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Even the black-clad one is...
Why? Why do you not fear me!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Jeez, you're actually pretty funny.
Especially because your speech is so melodramatic!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I-I can hardly help that!
It is the custom of oni to speak in this way!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Oni must be proud at all times, even in the way we speak! That's what my mother taught me!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Right, that's great.
Just go on preserving those proud oni customs then.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's an oni's strong point and pride, isn't it?
All right, what was this whole farce about?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You capture an oni despite being an oni yourself, then serve humans alcohol hoping we'll self-destruct?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's not like you at all. It's because you drink more than you can handle. So go wash your face and come back again.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ulp, gulp!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
All right, then. I acknowledge it was my loss this time! And I'll acknowledge you humans' so-called guts!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But my horns remain unbroken! So next time you insult me, I will make you regret it deeply!

 
## Conclusion: Awakening From a Drunken Dream
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Ibaraki-Douji has retreated.
We've won, Master!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, I can confirm it here!
It was the first time we tried it, so I'm glad it worked!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But the comms are still messed up.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm seeing a tiny Servant response in front of you...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm pretty sure it's just static, but...

 
**Mash:**
No. That's not static, Doctor.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Mmm. Fwah?

 
**Mash:**
Sh-She woke up, Senpai!
But she's an oni just like Ibaraki-Douji&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yup. Time for round two, huh?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Mnnyaah... Mmm? Mmmm?
...Ooohh!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Is that you, boy?
It's been forever. How've you been?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
! EAT THIS!

 
**Mash:**
K-Kintoki!? You're just attacking without warning!?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Sh-She stopped his axe at the last second.
She didn't even try to dodge&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh my. Such passion!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Jumping me as I get up... fufu.
You must be about ready to explode, huh?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I don't mind.
You're as handsome as ever, and it would wake me up.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey... What happened to you?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What do you mean? I'm me, aren't I?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
My pale skin, my swelling breasts, my voluptuous behind... They're all like you remember, right?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;Want to take a closer look?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I-I do not! Why don't you have any shame?

Golden... Were you two in a relationship?
 

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm always a victim!
And she's like this with everybody!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
More importantly!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're a greater oni than Ibaraki, so how'd you wind up looking just like an ordinary girl!

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. The power I sense from her is very weak.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, you're right.
I was wondering where all my strength had gone.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Looks like most of my power got absorbed by Ibaraki. Oh dear. That shouldn't be possible, huh?

 
**Mash:**
Do you remember...what happened?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
A little. So I know you tried really hard to save me, didn't you, boy?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I did not! You were just a bonus!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu. I was only half-awake, but I got to feel like a trapped princess.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It was a new experience... I liked it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, right. A rescued princess is supposed to thank you, isn't she? ...How about a kiss of gratitude? Come on...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
SPA&mdash;RK!

 
**Mash:**
He jumped back fast!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Aww, you're no fun.
You didn't have to run away.

 
**Mash:**
...Shuten-Douji, right?
I'd like an explanation as to what's going on here.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fair enough. I guess I can't spend all my time playing with the boy. ...I'll take you there. Follow me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Look, this is what you're searching for, isn't it?

 
**Mash:**
That's...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Holy Grail...or at least, something that looks very similar!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure of it.
What you're looking at is the root cause of all this!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It seems filled with some kind of fluid. That's...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I just woke up here with Ibaraki somehow, and this thing was right in front of us.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And it was filled with delicious wine.

 
**Mash:**
Um... You didn't.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yup. I drank it.

 
**Mash:**
...Something so obviously suspicious?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't want to ask, but why?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's just who she is.
I bet Ibaraki didn't want to, though.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Of course, Ibaraki was scared. She said it was a bad idea to eat things you find on the ground.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But when I asked her if it she was too good for my wine, she gave in and drank it down with tears in her eyes.

 
**Mash:**
Ibaraki...
You should've been nicer to her...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And then after I drank for a while, I got sleepy.
And then I woke up like this.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ibaraki absorbed my power, and I became a trapped princess, and the boy came after my body and soul...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I did not!

 
**Mash:**
I-I see. But in the end, you don't know what this is either?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
No, I don't, but I do know this: this is wine and I drank it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And you know how it ended up, right? So the answer is plain. This is&ndash;wine that grants wishes.

 
**Mash:**
!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wine poured into a Grail... Its role as an omnipotent wish granter activated... But is that really possible?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Come to think of it, I've been hearing someone's voice for a while.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I thought maybe I was just drunk... Is it an onmyouji?
He sounds like a wimp... Well, it doesn't matter.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Just so you're clear, this wine doesn't grant the wish itself.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It grants the wish in your heart, but&ndash;it twists it first.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Wine makes you drunk, and leads to bewilderment... Maybe that's why. That's what makes it fun, though.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see&ndash;which means that wine vaporized and spread through the air,

 
**Dr. Roman:**
and made all the normal people who couldn't fight it “drunk.”

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why everyone in the Kyoto area was acting so strangely.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Some people can handle their drink better than others. I'm glad Fujimaru was okay...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...By the way, Mash.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What would you do if a paper plane flew towards Fujimaru right now?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Say it was a paper plane thrown by the world champion paper plane thrower with a world record on the line.

 
**Mash:**
That's quite an undertaking... A new world record must involve a lot of suffering and drama, I assume.

 
**Mash:**
But I would immediately deploy my Noble Phantasm. Senpai's safety is my first priority.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(...Mash is tipsy too.)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait a second. Does that mean it's not just humans who get drunk here...but Servants too?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I think so. Ibaraki's wish was probably to go on a rampage with me...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But that got twisted into going on a rampage with my power.

 
**Mash:**
I'm not being affected, so it's okay...
But what about Mr. Golden?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My wish...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Come to think of it, you said you felt a lot stronger.
Was that it?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh&mdash;you wished for the same thing, huh?
Did you want to play with me that much?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
To hit each other with our exposed parts, staring into each other's eyes, moaning like beasts&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
N-No! A-Are you stupid or something? Of course not!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Sorry... I can't take you up on that offer the way I am right now.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But you worked some of that out with Ibaraki, right?
I guess you ended up with the wrong girl.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now then, I remember the kind of wine I drank, so&mdash;
Let's smash it.

 
**Mash:**
That's right. This thing is the cause of it all anyway.
We can't end this unless we destroy it.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Hey.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You... What was your wish?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Fufu. What do you think?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tch. Hell if I know.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're worried about me, aren't you? You're so cute... Both your body and your soul.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I like to mess around&mdash;but I especially like men who only have one love.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's a shame to get rid of this wine...
But I guess we don't have a choice.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
This wine makes you drunk on your own wishes.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And when you're drunk, things always seem twisted. This time it was especially bad. It twists you, yourself.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
This goes for Ibaraki too, but I've been far too twisted.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I've got no power, I can't eat people, I can't attack the boy... I'm just a little girl. This isn't me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
So I can't drink it down.
I can't just doze and enjoy the wine.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
No matter how much I've longed to see what I see when I open my eyes&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
This is just&mdash;a dream, brought on by too much drinking.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And now it's time to wake up.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh&ndash; Yes! We did it!
The cause of the abnormality is gone!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now that I'm awake...
It's time to go get drunk again.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Once I am, I won't let you get away, boy.
I swear&ndash;I'll pay you back for last time.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And then you can pour me drinks as part of my harem of hotties... Fufu...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
See you around.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
She looked so satisfied as she disappeared...
What did she want, anyway?

 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure, but I think I can guess.

 
**Mash:**
I think maybe since you were worried about her so much...

 
**Mash:**
She brought you here so she could laugh and tell you not to worry?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Tch. What the heck?
That just makes me worry more.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Man, this ain't golden at all.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Anyway, looks like my role here's done.
I might see you guys again somewhere, though.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Just be careful.

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Not all the mysteries have been solved.

 
**Mash:**
She said that there was a cup filled with wine placed in front of her. Which means&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Who put the cup there&ndash;
And who filled it with wine?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Who knows? If there was somebody behind it, this ain't over yet. Something else will happen.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But this is all for now. The oni of Rashomon are gone.
So I'm leaving.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are no Servants left.
We can assume we're finished here.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good work, Mash.
Good work, Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Let's head back to Chaldea, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
...

What is it, Mash?

...I'm sorry. I was a little curious what would happen if you were to get drunk...

 
**Mash:**
...Um, if you'd like, I'd be happy to have some alcohol with you after dinner.

 
**Mash:**
It's fine. I probably won't get drunk.
I've learned that this time.

**Dr. Roman:**
...No drinking until you're of legal age!
