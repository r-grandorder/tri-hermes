# Apocrypha/Inheritance of Glory
 
## Prelude
 
**Narration::**
Seven against seven.
Finally, at long last, they are all gathered.

 
**Narration::**
No Ruler has been summoned here. This Great Holy Grail War will have no effect on the world.

 
**Narration::**
The “other” Ruler is not here either.
He is already dead.

 
**Narration::**
He will never be sent here as a new Ruler now.

 
**Narration::**
In which case, this tiny, insignificant world that miraculously managed to remain...is mine.

 
**Narration::**
Yes, this is my world now.
It belongs to no one else.

 
**Narration::**
So I will repeat the cycle as many times as it takes. I will recreate the miracle, and this time I will ascend to glory.

 
**Narration::**
In the end, that is all I can do, all I can become.
And so, I have no choice but to proceed.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Oh. I'm dreaming.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Oh, we're doing this again, huh?

 
**Narration::**
Answer me... Answer me...
Hear my call...

 
**Narration::**
Hear my call, and answer me...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Who is this...?

 
**Narration::**
...Hear me, O feeble mortal... Thou art the one who clears the path for destiny... Hear my call, and answer me.

 
**Narration::**
I guess I'm falling now? Or maybe just lost?

 
**Narration::**
Either way, it definitely feels like I'm falling from a huge height. I flail my arms and legs around...

 
**Narration::**
...and end up sinking into a sea of darkness.

 
**Narration::**
...Awaken, Master of Chaldea...
The great Master who answered my call...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Great?
 
**Narration::**
Er, yeah. You&ndash;I mean, you DID restore humanity, didn't you? That certainly seems great to me...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Call?
 
**Narration::**
Yup, that's wh&ndash;Er, rather...
Forsooth, great Master who hath answered my call...

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...
...Master of Chaldea...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Has thou regained thy sense?
Canst thou see how many fingers I do hold before thee?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Welp, that settles it!

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Oh, yeah, so I AM dreaming!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yea, thou art correct. This is but a dream.
However, it is also quite real.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I summoned thee hither with this Holy Grail,
while thou yet slumbered...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It is a complicated matter to explain, but perhaps it would be best if thou thought of thyself as a sort of mental projection of thine own form.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Thy flesh and blood body...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...should yet slumber aboard the Shadow Border,
continuing thy journey.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...This world is in great peril, and to survive, it will need your&ndash;er, thy help. It will need THY help. Forsooth.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So you mean this is a job for Chaldea, huh?
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Thou dost seem perhaps TOO accustomed to this sort of thing.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Of course, that must be exactly why it was thee,
among all, who was summoned here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm sorry, who are you again?
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...My name is Fafnir. I am the evil dragon who once made off with the miracle of humankind.

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
So, what sayest thou?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Uh, what if I say no?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm guessing I can't leave until I solve this?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Nay, shouldst thou choo&ndash;ugh... Nope.
You can refuse if you want. If you do, that's that.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Yeah...
I should've known.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It was incredibly arrogant of me to call you here out of nowhere and ask you to fight.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something else out.
I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you like this.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That's so considerate... Tell me what's going on.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I want to know everything that's happening here.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...I see.
Very well then, I shall start at the beginning.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...
...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...This is more complicated than I thought...
Hold on, let me just get everything straight...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's okay. I'm not going anywhere.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Uh, first off, let me explain where you are right now.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
This is the Reverse Side of the World. Hmm, or maybe a hidden place on “the other side,” so to speak, is more accurate?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Basically, you can think of it as a mythical land and the home of magical beasts.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Your world, the human world,
is built on human laws.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...This world, however,
is entirely removed from those laws.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
This may be difficult to understand, but your world came to exist once humanity had covered the entire planet, like a cloth.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
But before that could happen,
beings called Phantasmals fled here.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Of course, I hear that Phantasmals have been showing up in your world again as well, now that humanity is in such disorder.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Sorry to interrupt, but...you mean like wyverns?
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yes, that's right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Phantasmals? Like what?
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Wyverns, bicorns, chimeras...
Creatures like that.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
They're supposed to live here, in this world, though. They shouldn't be visiting yours as though it were some sort of café.

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Now, this land is in grave danger,
thanks to the Greater Grail I brought here.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Greater Grail...?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
As in, the one that was in Fuyuki...?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
You really DO know your stuff.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I don't know what happened in your world, but in mine,
I had no choice but to bring the Greater Grail here to the Reverse Side.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Otherwise it would have caused all kinds of problems, you see.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
There was a problem, though. A certain Noble Phantasm partially destroyed the Greater Grail.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Even so, things were fine until now...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...but then, even though I didn't do anything,
it just kind of...broke. On its own.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Suuure it did.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
No, really, I didn't do anything.
I'm sure I didn't...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I may have a few gaps in my memory, but I'm fairly certain nothing happened during those gaps.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You expect me to believe that!?
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...I mean...I don't think I did, anyway.
I'll admit my memory is a little hazy, but even so...

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
A-at any rate, the real problem...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...is that a Holy Grail War is taking place inside the damaged Greater Grail.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Did you say...a Holy Grail War...?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yup.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
A miniature war between Servants is being waged inside the very Greater Grail they want to control.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I haven't actually seen any of the battles myself, but I know how many there have been. Just looking at the numbers here, it's been over ten thousand now.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
At first there were only two Servants. By the 567th Holy Grail War, there were four, and by the 2313th, there were seven.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...That was when my control of the Greater Grail started to waver.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
That is to say, someone is trying to take over the Greater Grail and use it for themselves.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
If something isn't done, the Greater Grail will continue to spin out of control until it's completely destroyed.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
And that would be...a problem.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Problem?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yes, a big problem. You see, this Greater Grail isn't mine. I'm just holding on to it.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I don't have any right to use it myself,
and I can't let anyone else use it either.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I have to take good care of it.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
If the Greater Grail went out of control, that would cause a great deal of trouble for all the Demonic Beasts who live here...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It's even possible that an event like that, or its aftermath, could damage one of the anchors that holds the world together.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
If the cloth&ndash;or texture, if you like&ndash;is torn, the laws of physics will be turned on their heads, and the Age of Gods will end up mixing with modern times.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
And that...wouldn't end well for anybody. Humans and Demonic Beasts would only end up hurting each other.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
So I'm asking you now:
Will you help me save this world?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Okay, I'll give it a shot.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Really...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
If there's something I can do to help...
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...!

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Thank you!!!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]

 
**Evil Dragon:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]

 
**Evil Dragon:**
?
???

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Are you okay?
Is something wrong?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
(Gesture at your ears)
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...I'm so sorry.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It's been so long since I actually spoke that I've forgotten how to do it at an appropriate volume.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
(Write on the ground)
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
I guess I got a little carried away...

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Ahem. Very well then, Let me try that again:
I want you to ride on my back.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
We'll need to dive into the domain within the Greater Grail itself.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So...I'm gonna get to be a dragon rider!?
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yes. You may be the first to do so since humanity began using the Gregorian calendar.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Oh man, I'm gonna get to be a dragoon!
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Ah, that is a popular misconception. A “dragoon,”
I am afraid, is not one who rides a dragon.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Though I do admit,
it has a very nice ring to it.

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Anyway, just climb up and grab one of my scales. Now, hold on... This will be my first flight in over ten years!

 
## Section 1: Dive, Inner World
 
**Evil Dragon:**
As I thought, Trifas has been recreated...along with the Assassin of Red's Hanging Gardens.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I'm surprised this world has been crafted with such detail, though... Who could have done this, and what could they be after?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Sorry, what's Trifas?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
A small city in Romania where a Great Holy Grail War took place. ...Hmm. I see there are a number of Dragon Tooth Warriors and golems roaming about.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
But those should be no trouble.
I'll just go ahead and burn them all.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That was amazing!
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Why thank you.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I shouldn't be too proud; this isn't something I trained hard to be able do or anything like that. Still, it's nice being complimented.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Yeowch, that's hot!
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Ah, sorry.
I guess I got a little carried away...

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
All right, let's just land here and then we'll&ndash;

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Uh oh...! There are Servants here...and they're wasting no time attacking us!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Khh...!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
This light...
That's Vasavi Shakti!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Karna's Noble Phantasm!?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Ghh...
Sorry! I'm going down...!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Are you all right...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
More or less...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
My wings are pretty messed up.
I won't be able to fly for a while.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I'm afraid I misjudged the situation...
I'm so sorry.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So, those were Servants we just ran into?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Not exactly.
At least, not in the true sense of the word.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
If we define Servants as pseudo-reproductions of people who have become Heroic Spirits, then the beings that attacked us don't quite qualify.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
If anything, they're more like...
Well, zombies, or maybe mecha.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
They're about as strong as Servants, but they have no emotions, and can't think for themselves.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Still, as tiny as this world is, I never thought they'd be able to reproduce their Noble Phantasms...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
They're coming!
 
**Evil Dragon:**
I'll stall them while you make your escape!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
We've gotta get out of here!
 
**Evil Dragon:**
That could be difficult.
I'm not exactly nimble in this form...

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Get to that fortress! You should be safe there.
Then&ndash;

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Damn, looks like we're out of time!
Why you...!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
They're still coming...!
Now what are they&ndash;

 
**Evil Dragon:**
They even managed to recreate Balmung...!?
Khh...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Fafnir!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Hurry, get out of here!
If they get you too, it's all over!

 
**???:**
...Oh? It seems we have a special guest.

 
**???:**
What a surprise to see a real flesh-and-blood Master here.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Who are you...?

 
**???:**
Custodian, let me take [♂ him /♀ her] off your hands.
I promise I shall get [♂ him /♀ her] to safety.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later!

 
**???:**
Okay, Master of Chaldea, get ready to run!

 
**???:**
Looks like we've got some Dragon Tooth Warriors to deal with. I will dispose of them.

 
**???:**
Oh, but first.

 
**???:**
Would you tell me your name, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm Fujimaru.

 
**???:**
All right, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru,
please listen to me.

 
**???:**
First, we're going to head for that fortress.

 
**???:**
My name is Chiron. I'll be happy to take care of any enemies we run into along the way.

 
**B：Chiron:**
But to do that,
I'll need someone to give me commands.

 
**B：Chiron:**
And that someone will be you, Master of Chaldea.

 
**B：Chiron:**
Now, let battle be joined!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Chiron:**
That should do it.
I'm glad this rescue was successful.

 
**Chiron:**
Now, let's get out of here, shall we?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What about Fafnir...?
 
**Chiron:**
Yes...he was just attacked with a number of Noble Phantasms...but he seems to be no worse for wear.

 
**Chiron:**
No wonder he's been the one keeping care of the Holy Grail. He's certainly quite durable.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
He still needs our help!
 
**Chiron:**
Not to worry.
Another Servant will be along soon to help him.

 

 
**Chiron:**
Rider!
The rest is up to you!

 
**Chiron:**
All right, we'd best be on our way.

 
**Chiron:**
It will be morning soon.

 
**Chiron:**
I'm not sure what you know about our current predicament...

 
**Chiron:**
...but I can explain that all once we are safe.

 
**Chiron:**
Come, let us hurry to the fortress.

 
## Section 2: Defense: Millennia Fortress
 
**Chiron:**
It won't be long now.
Soon, the dawn will break, and they will leave.

 
**Chiron:**
That is, they will disappear.

 
**Chiron:**
After that, we just have to hope that Rider did his job properly.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Who is this Rider?
 
**Chiron:**
I'll tell you his True Name once he returns. First, I need to bring you up to speed on what has been happening here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Can you tell me what's going on?
 
**Chiron:**
Gladly. Once the morning comes,
I will tell you everything I know.

 

 
**Chiron:**
...It's morning now.
Rider should return shortly.

 
**Chiron:**
You must be tired.
Why don't we take a short break?

 
**Chiron:**
Would you like something to drink?
Perhaps some coffee?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That would be great, thank you.
 
**Chiron:**
It may perhaps be a bit sweeter than you prefer...but I promise it will do wonders for your exhaustion.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
So, everything's fine now that it's morning?
 
**Chiron:**
That's right. They disappear each morning.
...Well, at six o'clock in the morning, to be exact.

 
**Chiron:**
We only realized this around the 734th Holy Grail War.

 

 
**Chiron:**
Here you go.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Ooh, this is delicious.

 
**Chiron:**
I'm glad you think so.

 
**Chiron:**
So, what did the Custodian tell you when you first arrived here?

 
**Chiron:**
I can fill in anything he may have left out.

 
**Chiron:**
I see, I see...
Very well then, let me explain everything else.

 
**Chiron:**
To begin, this is not like a typical Holy Grail War.

 
**Chiron:**
It does not involve seven Masters trying to kill one another, nor even seven classes of Servants with which to do so.

 
**Chiron:**
...Ah, so you have no experience with that sort of Holy Grail War. Well, trust me when I say that that is usually how these things go.

 
**Chiron:**
Now I hope you're paying attention;
this WILL be on the test.

 
**Chiron:**
Now, this Great Holy Grail War uses the Greater Grail's emergency system from Fuyuki to wage war with fourteen Servants rather than the customary seven.

 
**Chiron:**
That is to say, it is a battle between two teams of seven Servants.

 
**Chiron:**
...However, that war had in fact already concluded,
with Fafnir emerging as the apparent victor.

 
**Chiron:**
That is how he came into possession of the Greater Grail.

 
**Chiron:**
As for us, we are reproductions of the Servants who were summoned during that Great Holy Grail War.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Reproductions...?

 
**Chiron:**
In this world, the only two places that exist are the city of Trifas, and of course the Hanging Gardens.

 
**Chiron:**
...I suppose you could call this a sort of simulation.

 
**Chiron:**
Aha. That seems to have helped you understand.

 
**Chiron:**
Indeed, this is all one enormous simulation field designed to recreate that Great Holy Grail War.

 
**Chiron:**
We were originally imitation life-forms, going through the motions of battle without thought or emotion.

 
**Chiron:**
However, as this seemingly endless simulation repeated itself, something unexpected happened.

 
**Chiron:**
Namely, we developed intelligence, reason,
and even regained our memories as Servants.

 
**Chiron:**
That being said, we do not remember anything about the Great Holy Grail War.

 
**Chiron:**
You might say that I'm starting over from scratch.
At least as a Servant.

 
**Chiron:**
It's only in this tiny world that we become something close to real Servants.

 
**Chiron:**
Do you understand everything we've covered so far?
If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What sort of enemy are we up against?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Who is that dragon, anyway?
 

 
**Chiron:**
They are reproductions, just as we are. Unlike us, though, they have nothing in the way of intellect or reason...

 
**Chiron:**
...but what they do have are sheer numbers.

 
**Chiron:**
Of the fourteen Servants who were originally summoned to the Great Holy Grail War, we now face twelve.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That many!?

 
**Chiron:**
Yes, that many.

 
**Chiron:**
As we are all starting from scratch, I'm afraid I don't know any of their True Names other than the Rider on our side...

 
**Chiron:**
...but I believe the evil dragon does.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Who is that dragon, anyway?
 

 
**Chiron:**
His name is Fafnir.
He seems to be this Greater Grail's Custodian.

 
**Chiron:**
There is not a shred of doubt that he was the Great Holy Grail War's victor.

 
**Chiron:**
Though I'm afraid I have no idea how he secured his victory, or what he is doing in a place like this.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What sort of enemy are we up against?
 

 
**Chiron:**
As the Custodian, he would like this Greater Grail to stop simulating this war.

 
**Chiron:**
By rights, we should be helping him...but unfortunately, our enemies are just too strong.

 
**Chiron:**
What's more, we have not a moment to waste.

 
**Chiron:**
The other Servants have learned how to use their Noble Phantasms, despite still lacking consciousness.

 
**Chiron:**
And that brings us to the final stage of the tens of thousands of battles to the death we fourteen Servants have fought.

 
**Chiron:**
We have no choice but to repeat this battle.

 
**Chiron:**
And yet, the more we fight,
the worse the situation becomes.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
How did you and Rider become conscious?

 
**Chiron:**
A good question.
We wondered about that ourselves for a time...

 
**Chiron:**
It is our belief now that the Custodian altered the simulation's parameters to make us into proper Servants.

 
**Chiron:**
As the Greater Grail's Custodian, it should be well within his capabilities to recreate us in this world.

 
**Chiron:**
...Though it also seems he hesitated to do so until the very last moment.

 
**Chiron:**
Had he not, we may have had a few more allies on our side.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
How about just not fighting?

 
**Chiron:**
I'm afraid that would be difficult.
There is nowhere to seek refuge in this world.

 
**Chiron:**
Though you were fortunate enough to survive tonight,
there is no telling what tomorrow may hold.

 
**Chiron:**
They did not attack this fortress only because of the new, unexpected elements that you and Fafnir represent in the current situation.

 
**Chiron:**
Most likely, that was simply a function of the battle simulation program, rather than any thought or strategy on their part.

 
**Chiron:**
But the next time will be different.

 
**Chiron:**
Next time, I expect they will account for Fafnir in their calculations, and mount an assault on this fortress.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Then, what can we possibly&ndash;

 
**C：???:**
We fight till the end.
What other choice is there?

 
**Chiron:**
So you've returned, Rider.

 
**C：???:**
Sure have, Teacher.

 
**C：???:**
So, this is...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm Fujimaru.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm the Master of Chaldea.

 
**C：???:**
Hmm...
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

 
**C：???:**
I see, I see.
So you're one of those Master people!

 
**C：???:**
Sorry to bring you here just when things couldn't get any worse.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Um, excuse me, but...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I didn't catch your name.

 
**C：???:**
Oh, right, sorry 'bout that.
My True Name's Achilles.

 
**C：Achilles:**
You know about the Achilles tendon in your heel, right?
That was named after me.

 
**C：Achilles:**
I'm the guy who was completely invincible, except for a spot on his heel. Then I freakin' died when that bastard Paris shot me there with an arrow.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Oh, you mean this tendon?
 
**Achilles:**
Yup, that's the one.

 
**Achilles:**
Don't ever get stabbed there if you can help it.
Hurts like hell.

 
**Chiron:**
Of course, what he didn't mention was that, after he was shot, he decided to go out in a blaze of glory, wiping out a whole squadron of enemy soldiers before finally taking his own life.

 
**Achilles:**
Hell yeah! I was pretty badass back then,
if I do say so myself!

 
**Achilles:**
I was like a writer suddenly getting a flash of inspiration the night before a big deadline.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
...Are you something of a scatterbrain?
 
**Achilles:**
What? No way!

 
**Chiron:**
Hahaha, I see you're an excellent judge of character, Master of Chaldea.

 
**Chiron:**
Right you are. He's surprisingly scatterbrained and quite absentminded.

 
**Chiron:**
It's the one thing that hasn't changed a bit since he was alive.

 
**Achilles:**
Aw, come on!

 

 
**Chiron:**
At any rate... Achilles, what became of Fafnir?
The Custodian?

 
**Achilles:**
He's resting in the courtyard. Go check on him if you're worried about him, Master of Chaldea.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's beautiful here...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Indeed...
Even if it is just an imitation of the real thing.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
How badly are you hurt?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Quite badly, I'm afraid.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
The last Noble Phantasm I took the brunt of belonged to Siegfried...the Dragon-Slayer.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I'm afraid that, being a dragon,
I am more vulnerable to that attack than most.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I never thought these reproductions would ever learn how to use their originals' Noble Phantasms...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
To make matters worse, we have only two Servants allied with us... Though at least they're two extremely powerful A-rank ones.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Did you make them into Servants?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yes, I did.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
The idea was to convert all fourteen reproductions into intelligent Servants and investigate who or what is making them fight...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...but that would have been a horrible decision.
Besides, creating intelligent beings on a whim...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Such irresponsibility would have been too cruel.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
However, my hesitation has only ended up making the situation worse.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I never thought they could use their Noble Phantasms despite lacking the capacity for thought...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
So in a spur-of-the-moment decision, the best I could do was turn those two reproductions into Servants.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Even so, I'm afraid that does nothing to lessen my own sins.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I am too wounded to be able to move in this form for the time being.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
But I refuse to sit around doing nothing to help.
I'm going to make a terminal so I can join you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
A terminal...?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Just a moment.

 
**D：???:**
...Mm, hmm.
Ahh, ahh, ahh.

 
**D：???:**
...There we go. It feels good to be back to this height,
and to have this voice back.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So, you're the terminal?

 
**D：???:**
That's right.
This terminal's name is...Sieg.

 
**D：???:**
I'm afraid it can't do as much as my dragon body can, but at least this body can move.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So, what's going to happen to the dragon...?

 
**Sieg:**
He'll just have to go to sleep for a while.

 
**Sieg:**
Well, I'm not able to split my consciousness across multiple bodies...

 
**Sieg:**
Still, I can at least use my dragon body's power.
For brief moments, anyway.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm so sorry. Ever since I brought you here,
I've caused you nothing but trouble.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...Well, uh, in that case...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Nice to meet you...again.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Sieg:**
...Oh, right!
You want to shake hands. I remember now.

 
**Sieg:**
I hope I didn't squeeze too hard.
I'm still getting used to this body.

 
**Sieg:**
Now then, I'd like to meet with the other Servant before nightfall.

 
**Sieg:**
The Archer of Black, Chiron,
is the wisest sage among the centaur.

 
**Sieg:**
So if anyone can make a plan with the information I have, it's him.

 
**Sieg:**
Maybe even one that could defeat all twelve of the other Servants, including his former allies.

 
**Chiron:**
...I'll be blunt:
there is no way we can win.

 
**Sieg:**
I see...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I guess twelve Servants is just too tall an order...?
 
**Chiron:**
Correct. We are simply outmatched.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Even if all three of you team up?
 
**Chiron:**
I'm afraid so.

 

 
**Chiron:**
I'm afraid that this was a conclusion I reached even taking you into account, Master of Chaldea.

 
**Chiron:**
Achilles, do you know anything about the Great Holy Grail War?

 
**Achilles:**
Not really. All I know is I saw someone who looked a lot like Vlad III during the battle.

 
**Achilles:**
Oh, I think I saw Atalante from the Calydonian Boar hunt too. Or at least, someone who matched my old man's description of her.

 
**Achilles:**
But that's pretty much it.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Chiron:**
What about you, Sir Custodian?
Do you know anything about the other Servants?

 
**Sieg:**
...Of course.

 
**Sieg:**
All fourteen Servants are divided into two teams,
Black and Red.

 
**Sieg:**
The Black team includes Siegfried, the Saber of Black...Vlad III, the Lancer of Black...

 
**Sieg:**
Astolfo, the Rider of Black...
Avicebron, the Caster of Black...

 
**Sieg:**
Frankenstein, the Berserker of Black...
and Jack the Ripper, the Assassin of Black.

 
**Sieg:**
The Red team includes Mordred, the Saber of Red...
Atalante, the Archer of Red...

 
**Sieg:**
Karna, the Lancer of Red...
Shakespeare, the Caster of Red...

 
**Sieg:**
Spartacus, the Berserker of Red...
and Semiramis, the Assassin of Red.

 
**Chiron:**
I see, I see. Thank you, Sir Custodian.
You have an excellent memory.

 
**Sieg:**
...Just call me Sieg.
I'm not used to being called “Custodian.”

 
**Chiron:**
As you wish, Sir Sieg.

 
**Sieg:**
Anyway, I guess you have a point... We can't possibly fight all twelve of those Servants at once.

 
**Sieg:**
I guess I shouldn't have bothered trying to stop them from the outside...

 
**Chiron:**
Don't worry, Sir Sieg.
I am just getting started.

 
**Achilles:**
Aw, crap. This is gonna be bad.

 
**Chiron:**
Now, let's begin this class properly, shall we?

 
**Chiron:**
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Master of Chaldea,
would you do the honors?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Uhh... All rise!

 
**Achilles:**
!

 
**Sieg:**
!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Bow!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Be seated!

 
**Achilles:**
Wait. Why are we just sitting on the floor in the throne room?

 
**Sieg:**
I'm not actually certain myself, but...it seems to me this is more of a classroom right now.

 
**Achilles:**
Oh. Okay. Great.

 
**Chiron:**
Now then, our lesson for today will be...

 
**Chiron:**
“How to Defeat All Twelve Black and Red Enemy Servants.”

 
**Achilles:**
Wait, wait. I distinctly remember you saying that was impossible all of two minutes ago.

 
**Chiron:**
And it is, were we to face all twelve together.
So, what should we do then?

 
**Sieg:**
...Use our Noble Phantasms to take them all out at once? No, that wouldn't work.

 
**Achilles:**
...Take them out one at a time?

 
**Chiron:**
Yes, now you're getting warmer. But it would be a waste of resources to focus on only one at a time.

 
**Chiron:**
That would be like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.
Not to mention that the other eleven Servants are unlikely to simply wait patiently for their turn.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So...about three at a time?

 
**Chiron:**
Well done, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.
A gold star for you.

 
**Chiron:**
Achilles and I will team up to hold back nine of the Servants.

 
**Achilles:**
Bwa?

 
**Chiron:**
In the meantime, the two of you will defeat the remaining three. Simple, right?

 
**Sieg:**
Are you kidding? That's absurd.

 
**Chiron:**
I assure you, it is not absurd in the slightest.

 
**Achilles:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

 
**Achilles:**
Hold on a minute, Teacher.

 
**Achilles:**
Having these two take out three Servants at once is absurd enough, but how are the two of us going to hold back the other nine while they do!?

 
**Achilles:**
Did you forget they can use their Noble Phantasms now!?

 
**Chiron:**
Of course not. But based on what I saw last night, they are very obvious about when they are going to do so.

 
**Chiron:**
A Noble Phantasm is, after all,
a weakness as much as a trump card.

 
**Chiron:**
And right now, our enemies use them for no other reason than simply because they can.

 
**Sieg:**
So you're saying you want us to anticipate when they're about to use their Noble Phantasms and...just dodge?

 
**Chiron:**
Correct. You may be a little green now, Sir Custodi&ndash;Sir Sieg, but by nightfall, I will have trained you to see the signs of an imminent Noble Phantasm.

 
**Sieg:**
...I see.
By nightfall, you say? Then, that means...

 
**Achilles:**
(Oh great. Here comes the crash course...
I just know it.)

 
**Chiron:**
Achilles... Achilles... I'm told you wish to become a great hero, and that you want to do so as fast as you possibly can.

 
**Chiron:**
To be a hero, you will need good judgment and proper analytical faculties.

 
**C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:**
Yes, Teacher!

 
**Chiron:**
I promise that once you complete these trials,
you will be a full-fledged hero.

 
**C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:**
Yay! That's what I want!

 
**Chiron:**
Then for the next twenty-four hours,
from this moment onward...

 
**Chiron:**
...I want you to dodge every single one of my attacks.

 
**C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:**
Bwa?

 
**Achilles:**
(Next thing I knew, Chiron was shooting hundreds of arrows at me in that narrow cave. I still remember what he said...)

 
**Achilles:**
(“Don't worry! Once you can alter the trajectories of ten out of every hundred arrows, you'll be dodging all of them in no time!”)

 
**Achilles:**
(“It should be well within your capabilities thanks to that superhuman speed of yours!”)

 
**Achilles:**
(“Besides, none of them have arrowheads, so they won't kill you. They will just sting quite a lot!”)

 
**Achilles:**
(“What's that? You would actually prefer a more slow and steady approach instead? Hmm... I see...”)

 
**Achilles:**
(“I think that would suit me better as well.
This is certainly not an ideal way to educate you.”)

 
**Achilles:**
(“However, since we have precious little time, we should spend it polishing this method to the fullest.”)

 
**Achilles:**
Hey, Custod&ndash;I mean, Sieg?

 
**Sieg:**
Hm?

 
**Achilles:**
Just...don't die, okay?

 
**Sieg:**
...Of course. I'll make sure I survive (both tonight and tomorrow night).

 
**Achilles:**
Right on!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I get the feeling you two aren't quite on the same page...

 
**Chiron:**
Until now, the reproductions have simply come back to life whenever they are defeated.

 
**Chiron:**
In a system like that,
there can be neither failure nor victory.

 
**Chiron:**
But now that the Greater Grail's Custodian, Sir Sieg, and [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, the observer, are here...

 
**Chiron:**
...there is a very good chance that we can break this stalemate.

 
**Chiron:**
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, why don't you get some sleep? You will need to be well rested for tonight's battle.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Okay, will do.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm exhausted...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
So...sleepy...

 
**Narration::**
...Again.

 
**Narration::**
...Again.

 
**Narration::**
...Again, again, again.

 
**Narration::**
Come, let us battle to the death.
Let us fight, and grow purer.

 
**Narration::**
Go forth and recreate that battle,
for it still has yet to be settled.

 
**Narration::**
Recreate, recreate, recreate...and then,
I will obtain what I seek.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Still afternoon, huh...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
THAT was a weird dream...

 
**Sieg:**
(Huff, huff, huff...)

 
**Chiron:**
Oh, are you up already, Master?
We still have some time before the battle begins.

 
**Chiron:**
Hmm. You still have a ways to go, Sir Sieg,
but I suppose we can take a short break.

 
**Sieg:**
Thank...you...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Are you okay!?

 
**Sieg:**
More or less.

 
**Sieg:**
Chiron was kind enough to stop before he actually killed me.

 
**Chiron:**
In the meantime, Achilles and I will set about preparing our trap.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What trap?

 
**Chiron:**
A Bounded Field, to make it easier to separate our enemies.

 
**Chiron:**
Specifically, to cut off the nine Servants Achilles and I will be holding back from the three that you two will defeat.

 
**Chiron:**
...No doubt the enemy Casters will move to dispel the field, but I believe it will take them some time.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm fairly sure the Caster of Black, Avicebron,
is ill-equipped to deal with such things.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
And Shakespeare's...well...

 
**Chiron:**
Indeed, I cannot imagine that either of them has the skills needed to disable a Bounded Field.

 
**Chiron:**
Very well then, we will return shortly.
Achilles, come and help me.

 
**Achilles:**
Nine Servants... If I handle Karna and Semiramis,
and ignore all the other attacks...

 
**Chiron:**
Achilles!

 
**Achilles:**
Gah!!!

 
**Achilles:**
What is it, Teacher?
I was just thinking about how I'm gonna fight them all!

 
**Chiron:**
I need your help to create the Bounded Field.

 
**Achilles:**
Huh? But I'm no good at that sort of thing.

 
**Chiron:**
I know.
That's why I'm asking you.

 
**Achilles:**
A-ANOTHER lesson? Now!?

 
**Chiron:**
But of course. Planning your strategy before a battle is one of the most important steps toward victory. As such, you will continue to do so while you help me prepare the Bounded Field spell.

 
**Chiron:**
We will be facing nine at once. A split-second decision will mean the difference between life and death.

 
**Chiron:**
Getting accustomed to thinking about several different things at once now will aid your decision-making capabilities later. It is a part of your training.

 
**Achilles:**
Okay, okay, I'll do it already!

 
**Achilles:**
I swear, I can't let my guard down for a moment around you...

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What's up?

 
**Sieg:**
Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking how well that teacher and student complement one another.

 
**Sieg:**
...Chiron was the Archer of Black,
and Achilles the Rider of Red.

 
**Sieg:**
They were, in fact, enemies during the Great Holy Grail War.

 
**Sieg:**
As I recall, Achilles was born to a god... As such, he isn't easy to harm without possessing Divinity as well.

 
**Sieg:**
And the only Servant on the Black side who did...was Chiron.

 
**Sieg:**
Of course, Chiron isn't one to pull his punches,
even when facing one of his former pupils.

 
**Sieg:**
I wasn't able to see it for myself,
but I'm told theirs was an incredibly fearsome battle.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You really know your stuff.

 
**Sieg:**
Well, I did survive the Great Holy Grail War myself, though not because I was particularly strong.

 
**Sieg:**
...I wasn't even a Master.
I just... How do I put this...

 
**Sieg:**
I suppose I was very lucky.

 
**Sieg:**
I wasn't very skilled, nor did I have the sort of charisma needed to command a Servant.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Could you tell me more about what happened?

 
**Sieg:**
...Yes, I suppose I should.

 
**Sieg:**
I don't think it will be especially useful, but now that I've summoned you here, the least I can do is answer your questions.

 
**Sieg:**
I am an artificially created life-form called a homunculus.

 
**Sieg:**
Huh? You thought homunculi were enemies that looked like snowmen?

 
**Sieg:**
...I'm afraid I don't know anything about that. I can only assume those homunculi were made some other way.

 
**Sieg:**
They do say that we&ndash;well, the Yggdmillennia production process was the work of a distinguished family of alchemists.

 
**Sieg:**
As for me, an Yggdmillennia mage created me so that I could provide magical energy.

 
**Sieg:**
...It takes a vast amount of magical energy to keep a Servant materialized, to say nothing of using their Noble Phantasm.

 
**Sieg:**
So there were a lot of other homunculi besides me who were all here at this fortress to provide the Servants with magical energy.

 
**Sieg:**
Over half of them ended up wrung completely dry of magical energy and died...but I ran away.

 
**Sieg:**
...All because I didn't want to die.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...You say that like it's a bad thing.
 
**Sieg:**
Ah...

 
**Sieg:**
I guess...I would be lying if I said I didn't feel guilty.

 
**Sieg:**
Both about abandoning everyone so I could survive...and that I am still alive now...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Do you regret that?
 
**Sieg:**
...That's a difficult question,
but...I don't think so.

 

 
**Sieg:**
This Greater Grail is precious. Every Servant who fought in the war risked their lives for it.

 
**Sieg:**
I can't let it fall into the wrong hands.

 
**Chiron:**
...Tonight's Great Holy Grail War is about to begin.
Are you ready, Achilles?

 
**Achilles:**
Hell yeah I am!

 
**Chiron:**
We will hold off nine of the hostile Servants,
and you will defeat three of them.

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, are you ready?

 
**Sieg:**
I am.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
All set!

 
**Chiron:**
Good.
I wish you luck.

 
**Achilles:**
Don't worry. You can always shout for help if things go sideways!

 
**Achilles:**
But hey, I'm sure things'll work out somehow!

 
**Chiron:**
All right...let's go!

 
**Chiron:**
...Screen spell, Asteri Amina.

 
**Chiron:**
Good, they've been separated.
Now it's time to lure them out.

 
**Chiron:**
We shall do our utmost to ensure that [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru and Sir Sieg are able to defeat their targets without drawing attention to themselves.

 
**Chiron:**
And of course, do take care not to destroy the wall.

 
**Achilles:**
Man, that's a lotta stuff to keep track of. This is already tough, and you're not exactly making it easier!

 
**Chiron:**
Hahaha, don't worry. I have less practical experience in battle than you do.

 
**Chiron:**
If anything, I will be counting on YOU to show ME the ropes.

 
**Sieg:**
Okay, I see three of them.

 
**Sieg:**
The Caster of Red, the Caster of Black,
and the Assassin of Black, huh?

 
**Sieg:**
They are not quite as strong as many of the others, but they are still quite formidable.

 
**Sieg:**
...Make sure to watch out for the Assassin,
Jack the Ripper, in particular.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Yeah, I, uh...I know.

 
**Sieg:**
Good.
...Let's go, Master!

 
## Section 3: Are You Our Mommy?
 
**Sieg:**
How do you like that!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...It's morning!

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg! [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru!

 
**Achilles:**
Hey, you're alive!
Looks like you even kicked some ass!

 
**Chiron:**
The other nine have fallen back as well.

 
**Chiron:**
While we still don't know what the next night will bring...for now, let us rejoice in our victory.

 
**Sieg:**
You said it!
Thank you, everyone.

 
**Sieg:**
I only hope something changes for the better before tonight...

 
**Achilles:**
Ah, don't worry. It'll all work out.
That's what my gut says, and it hasn't failed me yet.

 
**Sieg:**
...I hope you're right...

 
**Achilles:**
Man, Sieg, you're a bit of a downer, aren't you?
Why all the pessimism?

 
**Sieg:**
I can't help but be anxious. Not with the Greater Grail's fate resting on my shoulders.

 
**Achilles:**
What's the big deal?
It's yours to do with as you want, right?

 
**Achilles:**
If worse comes to worst,
couldn't you just smash it and call it a day?

 
**Sieg:**
No, I couldn't.
That...that's the one thing I can't do.

 
**Chiron:**
Hmm.

 
**Chiron:**
There must be something driving the Servant copies,
though I'm afraid I don't know what it may be...

 
**Chiron:**
At any rate, why don't we take the rest of today off?

 
**Chiron:**
...After we prepare another screen spell,
just in case they'll fall for the same trick.

 
**Achilles:**
...You mean I have to do all that AGAIN!?

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg, would you be so kind as to accompany
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru back to the fortress?

 
**Sieg:**
Of course.
Shall we, Fujimaru?

 
**Sieg:**
...Now that I think about it, it seems rude to call you by your name. How should I address you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You can call me whatever you want, really.

 
**Sieg:**
I see...
Then I'll try to think of something that suits me.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm going to check up on my real body.
Go ahead and get some rest.

 
**Sieg:**
I don't think you'll have to worry about getting hungry while you're here...

 
**Sieg:**
...but if you feel like eating something, I'd be happy to bring you some food from the communal kitchen.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm fine, thank you.
 
**Sieg:**
I see.
Then please get some rest.

 
**Sieg:**
Sweet dreams.
...That does have a nice ring to it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You know, I think I would like to grab a bite.
 
**Sieg:**
Understood.
I'll bring it to you while you sleep.

 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So sleepy again...

 
**Narration::**
Mo...mmy...
Mommy. Mommy...!

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Murderer on a misty night, serial killer of women, young girl, gestalt evil spirit, Assassin-class, high-rank Presence Concealment, expert torturer.

Now go! Save the world! Go and save our people!

---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That was a weird dream...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Err... Is someone speaking to me...?

 
**???:**
Helloooooo! Are you awaaake!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Sieg? Is that you?

 
**???:**
Nooo!
I'm not Sieg. Come on, Mommy!

 
**???:**
Ah, you're awake!

 
**???:**
Good morning. Are you our mommy?

 
**???:**
It's okay if you're not!
You still seem like it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What the...!?

 
**???:**
We're the Assassin of Black, Jack the Ripper.

 
**Jack:**
Is something wrong? Why are you so surprised?
You are the one who summoned us, right, Mommy?

 
**Sieg:**
Fujimaru, we've got trouble!

 
**Jack:**
?

 
**Sieg:**
!

 
**Sieg:**
You're...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I don't even know what's going on anymore...

 
**Sieg:**
...M-me neither.

 
**Jack:**
Who're you? Are you a Servant?
A friend? A foe? Which ooone?

 
**Jack:**
What do you want me to do with him, Mommy?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Just calm down, okay?

 
**Sieg:**
...I'm a friend.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm...your friend.

 
**Jack:**
...Oh really? We don't really get it,
but we're not gonna fight, huh?

 
**Sieg:**
Fujimaru.

 
**Sieg:**
Come with me. It's not just her. The other two Servants we fought last night have shown up as well.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I see, I see!
So that's what's going on here!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, now that I know what is happening,
permit me to introduce myself!

 
**Shakespeare:**
My name is William Shakespeare. Though perhaps Caster of Red would better suit me here?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, hello there!
I see, so you're the Greater Grail's Custodian.

 
**Shakespeare:**
And you must be the Master of Chaldea he summoned!

 
**Shakespeare:**
...I see, I see. So you have come to save the Custodian's bacon, as it were.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hahahaha, how wonderful, how fantastic!
What an extraordinary life you must lead!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Please allow me to mark this occasion by quoting a line from one of my many famou&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Do you ever shut up?

 
**Avicebron:**
So the only ones who came back to life were those of us you two fought last night?

 
**Sieg:**
Exactly.

 
**Sieg:**
Now, I have a question for all of you:
Do you recall why you were summoned here?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Not at all, no.

 
**Avicebron:**
Likewise.

 
**Jack:**
No idea. A Holy Grail War?
...No, that's not it.

 
**Jack:**
We don't sense any bloodlust or animosity,
even though you're Servants.

 
**Chiron:**
This is quite a surprise...

 
**Chiron:**
I did consider this possibility, but I never thought we would be joined by three more Servants all at once.

 
**Chiron:**
This is certainly a welcome change in our situation.

 
**Achilles:**
Hell yeah! Now this is more like it!

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Shakespeare.
Sir Avicebron.

 
**Chiron:**
And...um...

 
**Jack:**
Us? We're Jack the Ripper.

 
**Shakespeare:**
You're whom!?

 
**Achilles:**
The hell!?

 
**Chiron:**
Well now, it seems this is a day of surprises.

 
**Sieg:**
...That's true. When you think about it,
this really IS surprising.

 
**Jack:**
...
...

 
**Jack:**
Mommyyy, everyone's looking at us funny...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Okay guys, no more staring.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
It's okay, Jack. Come here.

 
**Jack:**
'kaaay.

 
**Sieg:**
I didn't know she was so attached...

 
**Avicebron:**
Chiron, perhaps you can explain what's going on here in a way that all of us can understand?

 
**Chiron:**
Very well then, I shall do my best to be concise.

 
**Avicebron:**
Now...

 
**Shakespeare:**
...I...

 
**Jack:**
...see.

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg. [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.

 
**Chiron:**
It seems that the other Servants will return to our side once you have defeated them.

 
**Chiron:**
This should give us more than even odds against the remaining nine Servants.

 
**Achilles:**
Yeah, I'd say things are looking up now.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Teacher? May I say something?

 
**Shakespeare:**
The difficulty here is that I am afraid Avicebron and I are simply not at all suited for combat.

 
**Chiron:**
No need to worry about that, Sir Shakespeare.

 
**Chiron:**
Master Fujimaru and Sir Sieg know very well what you can and cannot do, and are sure to provide expert guidance.

 
**Sieg:**
Th-that's a pretty tall order...
But I'll do what I can.

 
**Sieg:**
Are you up for this, Fujimaru?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We'll figure something out...I think.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I see, I see. In that case, dear patrons, we gladly offer our services for you to employ as you see fit!

 
**Avicebron:**
Thank you for having us.

 
**Jack:**
What should we do, Mommy and Mr. Custodian?

 
**Sieg:**
Okay, well first let's figure out how we can best incorporate them into our plan for tonight.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'll start by keeping an eye on Shakespeare.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Can't have a certain genius writer slacking off.

 
**Sieg:**
Good point.

 
**Sieg:**
Speaking for myself, though, I just want to make sure you don't do anything that would complicate the situation further.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I'm glad to know you two trust me so implicitly!

 
**Avicebron:**
What in the world did you do?

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Jack:**
Hey! Mr. Custodian!

 
**Sieg:**
Y-yes?

 
**Jack:**
Are you avoiding us?

 
**Sieg:**
No, of course I'm&ndash;

 
**Sieg:**
No, I guess I am, aren't I?
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

 
**Jack:**
Did we try to kill each other or something?

 
**Sieg:**
Yes. I...I'm afraid I saw what happened in your past.

 
**Jack:**
Hmm. Now we understand.
What did you think about it?

 
**Sieg:**
I thought...it was horrible.

 
**Jack:**
Yes, we guess it was.
But why does it bother you, Mr. Custodian?

 
**Jack:**
Why would other people's pasts or memories matter to you?

 
**Sieg:**
Well, I care...

 
**Sieg:**
I wanted to save all of you.

 
**Jack:**
Even though we're here now because you couldn't save us?

 
**Sieg:**
...That's true. You're right about that.

 
**Sieg:**
Hmm, what's the expression for this again?
I think it's...

 
**Jack:**
Feeling down?

 
**Sieg:**
Not exactly, but it's close...

 
**Jack:**
At a loss for words?

 
**Sieg:**
That's it.

 
**Jack:**
We see. So we lost.

 
**Sieg:**
Well, technically speaking,
I wasn't the one who beat you...

 
**Sieg:**
...but I WAS there when you fell.

 
**Jack:**
That's okay. We were fighting a Holy Grail&ndash;a Great Holy Grail War, right?

 
**Jack:**
Everybody tries to kill everybody else in those.

 
**Jack:**
But, we were on the Black team, right?
So why were we fighting you?

 
**Jack:**
Didn't Mr. Chiron say you were on the Black team too?

 
**Sieg:**
...It's kind of a long story.
Do you still want to hear it?

 
**Jack:**
Nuh-uh!

 
**Sieg:**
Got it.

 
**Sieg:**
Why don't we talk about something else, then?
How does that sound?

 
**Jack:**
Sure!
As long as it's not about doctors or London!

 
**Sieg:**
All right then, let's see...
I know, what about food?

 
**Sieg:**
...I didn't realize we'd been talking for so long.

 
**Jack:**
Oh, it's Mommy! Hi, Mommy!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We'd better get going.
 
**Jack:**
It's gonna be night soon?
Okay, let's go!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
It's almost time for the next battle.
 
**Sieg:**
Right.
Let's give it our all!

 
**Jack:**
Yeah!

 

 
**Chiron:**
All right, our plan for tonight is essentially the same as yesterday. We will lure three enemy Servants out and distract the others so they don't interfere.

 
**Chiron:**
But tonight, I won't ask Sir Sieg and Master Fujimaru to handle the three Servants all on their own.

 
**Chiron:**
Achilles, I want you to go with them while I handle the diversion.

 
**Achilles:**
Really? You sure?

 
**Chiron:**
Avicebron, I want you to summon as many golems as you can and have them follow my lead.

 
**Chiron:**
As for Shakespeare... Why don't you cast Enchant on whichever side you think would provide the most entertainment?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That's your plan for him!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Most happily! In that case,
I shall go with Fujimaru, naturally!

 
**Shakespeare:**
For [♂ his /♀ her] side looks to be entertaining indeed!

 
**Chiron:**
You see? It worked out nicely.

 
**Sieg:**
...Chiron's actually quite cunning...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Of course, do be aware that I absolutely will not be taking part in the fighting myself!

 
**Jack:**
Teacher! Teacher!
We wanna fight with Mommy too!

 
**Chiron:**
I'm sorry, Jack, but I'm afraid that would leave a hole in our defenses.

 
**Chiron:**
And that would only make trouble for your mother.

 
**Jack:**
Aww...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Please, Jack?

 
**Jack:**
Oh, all right, Mommy!
We'll go do our best to dismember them all!

 
**Sieg:**
I'm surprised she's so obedient...

 
**Achilles:**
All right then, Sieg and Master,
let's get this party started!

 
**Achilles:**
Hm? Ah, it's no big deal. I can tell you're a good Master from the way you fought last night.

 
**Achilles:**
So, y'know, it just makes sense for me to take my orders from you!

 
**Achilles:**
But hey, don't worry about me.
You don't need to change anything you're doing.

 
**Achilles:**
Just keep following your own path,
and I'll clear the way for you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Thank you.
 
**Achilles:**
No problem!
Trust me, I got it covered!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Would you happen to know the Queen of the Amazons?
 
**Achilles:**
...
...

 
**Achilles:**
Y-yes, I do.

 
**Achilles:**
Wait. Don't tell me she's on the enemy side? She's not, right? Huh? She could be summoned to Chaldea at some point?

 
**Achilles:**
N-no. That's fine. I'm fine. This is fine...
Everything...everything is fine. Yes.

 

 
**Sieg:**
...This feels so strange.

 
**Sieg:**
Hm? What do I mean? Well, during the Great Holy Grail War, I never directly interacted with Achilles.

 
**Sieg:**
I never thought I'd end up fighting alongside him.
This should make for some good memories.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Memories?

 
**Sieg:**
Well, yeah. It's nice having memories like this, isn't it? Far as I'm concerned, you can never have too many.

 
**Sieg:**
Especially in my case,
since I don't have all that many to begin with.

 
**Sieg:**
All right, let's get to fighting. There's no way we can lose with this team, no matter who we're up against.

 
**Sieg:**
...At least, I hope so.

 
**Achilles:**
Well that doesn't sound good.
What's up? You worried about something?

 
**Sieg:**
Honestly, I've got a bad feeling about this.

 
**Sieg:**
It's great that all three Servants we defeated came over to our side. That's certainly the best outcome we could've wished for.

 
**Sieg:**
But...that's also why I'm worried.

 
**Sieg:**
I can't see us having that kind of luck twice.

 
**Achilles:**
...Yeah, I guess you've got a point there.
In fact, I've been feeling the same thing.

 
**Achilles:**
And I'm sure that means we're going to be facing some tough opponents! We're counting on you, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I-I'll do my best!

 
**Chiron:**
All right, tonight's Great Holy Grail War is about to begin. Good luck to you all!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Very well then, my boon companions! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war! Keep my glorious words close to your heart, and may fortune smile upon you!

 
**Sieg:**
Is that really going to help us...?

 
**Sieg:**
Oh well, I guess we don't need it anyway.
Let's go, Fujimaru!

 
## Section 4: Confrontation: Dual Swords and Cavalry
 
**Achilles:**
Got 'em!

 
**Achilles:**
...Man. I can't say exactly what it is,
but something about this really bothers me.

 
**Sieg:**
Agreed. But at least while we were fighting them,
it was clear they were enemies.

 
**Sieg:**
And since it wasn't possible to talk with them,
fighting was the only choice we had.

 
**Achilles:**
Still...don't you think it's strange?

 
**Achilles:**
Normally, no one can so much as scratch me unless they've got divine blood...

 
**Achilles:**
...but those guys practically beat me black and blue back there.

 
**Sieg:**
Yes, I see what you mean.

 
**Sieg:**
It's possible there's more to Atalante and Spartacus's legends than we know...

 
**Sieg:**
...but there's absolutely no way Frankenstein could secretly have divine blood.

 
**Sieg:**
Her origin is too modern, and the circumstances of her creation rule it out entirely.

 
**Achilles:**
Maybe so, but I can still feel the spikes from that mace of hers when she smacked me with the thing!

 
**Achilles:**
That would've caved in anyone else's rib cage.

 
**Chiron:**
Are you still alive, Achilles?

 
**Achilles:**
Last I checked.
How 'bout you, Teacher?

 
**Chiron:**
I am, yes, as you see.
Though I am considerably worse for wear.

 
**Avicebron:**
I'm afraid it was all my golems could do just to hold back one of the enemy Servants.

 
**Jack:**
Are you okay, Mommy?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What about you, Jack? Are you hurt?

 
**Jack:**
Hmm. We think we're hurt a lot...
Yeah, we're really hurt a lot...

 
**Jack:**
But we're okay!
We made fog and used it to get away!

 
**Sieg:**
I'm glad to see you're all alive.

 
**Jack:**
We don't think we are all alive, Mr. Custodian.

 
**Sieg:**
...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What do you mean...!?

 
**Chiron:**
Yes, that's right.
We need to hurry back to the fortress!

 
**Chiron:**
You see, we actually faced eight Servants.

 
**Chiron:**
And somehow those Servants included both Jack and Avicebron.

 
**Chiron:**
That was certainly a surprise.

 
**Avicebron:**
It was odd, I must admit,
to be fighting a stronger version of myself.

 
**Chiron:**
Curiously, Shakespeare was nowhere to be seen.

 
**Sieg:**
Oh no. You don't mean...

 
**Chiron:**
I'm afraid I do.

 
**Chiron:**
They may have decided to divide and conquer,
just like we have...!

 
**Sieg:**
Then, the Caster of Red may have gone to fight Shakespeare...!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
I thought I was a goner!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You're still alive!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hahaha, welcome back! I'm thrilled to see you're all safe! Though not as much as I am to BE safe!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I say, is something wrong?

 
**Shakespeare:**
You all seem quite disappointed.
Don't tell me you were hoping I was dead!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
No, no, nothing like that.

 
**Chiron:**
Hahaha, be at ease, Shakespeare.
We are, of course, all relieved to see you are safe.

 
**Jack:**
But, Mr. Chiron, didn't you say we would have to redo all the fortress's defenses if he died?

 
**Avicebron:**
I also recall you saying you would need to keep Master safe, now that the enemy has taken us by surprise.

 
**Chiron:**
Hahahaha, only in the hypothetical sense, I assure you.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, if the truth must out&ndash;and we all know it must&ndash;I was quite sure I had breathed my last when I came under attack!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Thank goodness I'm so weak!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
How do we know you're the real Shakespeare?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh dear, not this trope! You don't really think I've been switched out for my evil doppelgänger, do you!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hmm, then again, he was me in every sense, a perfect facsimile, so I may not be altogether credible here...

 
**Shakespeare:**
That is, aside from the fact that he never said a word, and was shrouded in a most ominous aura...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Still, were one to suggest I might become a more complete version of myself by defeating...myself, I could hardly gainsay them.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Uh-oh. I seem to have talked myself into a corner!

 
**Shakespeare:**
O world, thy slippery turns, indeed!

 
**Jack:**
Dismember, dismember♪

 
**Shakespeare:**
(Gulp) The child fairly radiates excitement...

 
**Avicebron:**
Well, even if that does turn out to be the case,
I see no great cause for concern.

 
**Avicebron:**
After all, if our assumptions are correct, the Servants we defeated last night should soon come to our side.

 
**Chiron:**
Yes, that's true. Very well then, Shakespeare, please remain close to me until the new Servants arrive.

 
**Shakespeare:**
One question, Professor:
What fate might I meet should I decline to do so?

 
**Chiron:**
I hope it does not come to that.

 
**Chiron:**
Transient version of him though you may be, it would still pain me to fill the world's greatest writer with arrows...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Heavens, you're quite serious, aren't you?
Understood!

 
**Chiron:**
All right, now we just have to wait for the resummoning.

 
**Sieg:**
Does this mean...things are going well?

 
**Chiron:**
I'm not so sure.

 
**Chiron:**
I have the sense that matters are progressing according to the enemy's plan.

 
**Chiron:**
What about you, Sir Sieg?

 
**Sieg:**
...Yes, I agree.

 
**Sieg:**
I feel like our enemy is going to come at us even harder, enough to negate our newfound advantage.

 
**Achilles:**
Not to mention that it seems all their Servants have gained Divinity somehow...

 
**Jack:**
Those other versions of us were really tough. If they're even stronger next time...we might not be able to beat them.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Even so, our job hasn't changed.

 
**Chiron:**
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru is right.

 
**Chiron:**
No matter what they may come at us with,
this is the only viable strategy we have.

 
**Chiron:**
We will just have to have faith that our opponent's strength is not without limit.

 
**Chiron:**
Very well then, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru&ndash;No,
on second thought, perhaps I should address you as...

 
**Chiron:**
...our Master.

 
**Chiron:**
We will be counting on you once again in the next battle as well.

 
**Narration::**
Rider, it was fine with me. Once I had fallen, I wouldn't have needed to spread my wings and fly any longer...

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Hero of Greek mythology, provider of wind, retainer to Artemis, hero of the Argonauts, hunter of the Calydonian Boar, noble beast.

 
**Narration::**
Atalante.

 
**Narration::**
It'll take more than cutting off my legs to stop me.

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Giant of a man who shattered the shackles of oppression, smiling rebel who lay waste to all around him, indomitable monster of the coliseum.

 
**Narration::**
Spartacus.

 
**Narration::**
Come...with...me.

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Dr. Frankenstein's greatest legacy, girl revived with lightning, patchwork body, doll with a heart of fury.

 
**Narration::**
Frankenstein.

 
**Narration::**
Establishing all three Servants' Spirit Origins.

 
**Narration::**
This is not the end. I won't let it end.
I'll never let it end.

 
**Sieg:**
I brought you something to eat.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It seems like there's more food now than last time?
 
**Sieg:**
Oh, yes, I thought we might eat together.
Assuming you don't mind, of course.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Is this for two people?
 
**Sieg:**
Yes, if it's not too much trouble...

 

 
**Sieg:**
Good. ...I'm glad.
All right, shall we?

 
**Sieg:**
I hope it tastes okay?
I can't tell myself.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's delicious.
 
**Sieg:**
I'm glad to hear that.

 
**Sieg:**
When the Greater Grail first came into my possession, I never thought I'd one day use my power as its Custodian for something as simple as cooking.

 
**Sieg:**
...I've never actually cooked before, you see.

 
**Sieg:**
Chiron looks like he knows his way around a kitchen,
but he's got plenty of other things to worry about.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You mean you can't taste anything?
 
**Sieg:**
Not very well, no.
Not unless it's really sweet...and even then, just barely.

 
**Sieg:**
So the only way I can cook is to use my power as the Greater Grail's Custodian to grant a wish.

 
**Sieg:**
...But I figured a little wish-granting would be okay, especially if it was done to help you.

 

 
**Sieg:**
I see, I see.

 
**Sieg:**
Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity...
Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...

 
**Sieg:**
Shadow Border... A world of white nothingness,
as far as the eye can see...

 
**Sieg:**
Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity...
Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...

 
**Sieg:**
Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity...
Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...

 

 
**Sieg:**
...It sounds like you have more than your share of troubles in your world, too.

 
**Sieg:**
Don't worry, though.
I promise you'll be fine.

 
**Sieg:**
Whatever happens here, I will use my power as the Greater Grail's Custodian to send you home. You have my word on that.

 
**Sieg:**
So please, just think of this as an unusually long dream.

 
**Sieg:**
If things take a turn for the worse,
all you have to do is wake up.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Thank you.

 
**Sieg:**
Don't thank me. I'm the one who dragged you into all this, after all.

 
**Sieg:**
But never mind that. I'd love to hear more about your world. I'm especially interested in what you were like before you became a Master.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You know, come to think of it...

 
**Sieg:**
Hm?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You don't talk like you do when you're a dragon.

 
**Sieg:**
Oh, that? Well...

 
**Sieg:**
Nobody in my world had ever summoned a Master before, so...

 
**Sieg:**
...I gave it some thought and figured I should try to act...appropriate for that form, I suppose?

 
**Sieg:**
In hindsight, I guess I might've sounded kind of silly, though...

 
**Sieg:**
I mean, all that faux Old English and such...what was I thinking? It's embarrassing!

 
**Sieg:**
Please...just do me a favor and forget all that?

 
**Sieg:**
Ah!

 
**Sieg:**
Somebody's attacking me in the courtyard!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Let's go!

 
**Fran:**
Ughhh... Ughhh!!!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...
...

 
**Fran:**
Uuugh!

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Looks like she's trying to tell you those are her flowers...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I think...she wants you to get off the flowers...?

 
**Sieg:**
I, uh, I see.
I'm impressed you understood her.

 
**Sieg:**
Nonetheless, that dragon is my real body,
and I'm afraid I can't move it right now.

 
**Sieg:**
You can, um, just shove it into a corner if you want?
I'm afraid that's the best I can offer. Sorry...

 
**Fran:**
Ugh...
Uhh...

 
**Spartacus:**
Hmm. So that means...
Yes, it would seem this dragon is an oppress&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
No! No oppressors here!

 
**Spartacus:**
Oppressor... Not an oppressor...
Hmm, that's a difficult question.

 
**Spartacus:**
After all, I came to this land to fight,
to overthrow my enemies.

 
**Spartacus:**
So would it not follow that the dragon IS a symbol of the oppressors here?

 
**Fran:**
Uhh...

 
**Spartacus:**
...He's not an oppressor?
Very well, then I shall wait.

 
**Spartacus:**
The oppressors are sure to come. When they do, that is when I shall act, and my songs of triumph ring forth.

 
**Spartacus:**
In the meantime...I will wait here,
in this flower garden.

 
**Spartacus:**
Good night, sweet rebellion.

 
**Fran:**
Ugh!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
There, there.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Easy now.

 
**Spartacus:**
Zzz...

 
**Fran:**
Ugh... Uhh...

 
**Sieg:**
So they've both fallen asleep, huh...
Oh well, they should wake up once night falls.

 
**Sieg:**
Anyway, if they've both been summoned,
then she must have been as well...

 
**Achilles:**
...
...

 
**Atalante:**
Achilles, was it?
Do I have something on my face?

 
**Achilles:**
Are you the same Atalante my old man told me about?

 
**Atalante:**
...Ah, I see. So you're Peleus's son.

 
**Atalante:**
I remember beating him in a wrestling match once.

 
**Atalante:**
That was a good match.

 
**Chiron:**
Atalante, I'm sorry to impose,
but would you help me build the trap for tonight?

 
**Chiron:**
Your skills as a huntress likely make you far better at placing a trap in a forest than I.

 
**Atalante:**
Very well.

 
**Atalante:**
...I must ask, though:
Why was I resummoned?

 
**Atalante:**
Actually, was I even properly summoned to begin with?

 
**Atalante:**
If we are inside the Greater Grail now,
then what am I supposed to do?

 
**Chiron:**
I believe we are meant to fight in order to keep the Greater Grail safe. Even if we were indeed enemies in the original war.

 
**Atalante:**
...Well, that is no matter. I have had plenty of other former enemies become allies before.

 
**Achilles:**
You and I were both Red,
so I guess we were always allies.

 
**Atalante:**
So, the immortal Achilles is my ally now, huh?
Usually I would find that encouraging...

 
**Atalante:**
...but if all our opponents have Divinity,
that does not offer much of an advantage.

 
**Chiron:**
Perhaps, but even without his invincibility,
he is far more powerful than any of them.

 
**Chiron:**
...Indeed, it is quite fortunate that Achilles is not on their side.

 
**Chiron:**
Especially since we are the only ones on our side with divine blood at the moment.

 
**Atalante:**
I must say, it is an odd feeling to know that a copy of myself fights for our enemy...

 
**Atalante:**
Achilles, be sure you do not drag my corpse around the fortress.

 
**Achilles:**
I'm not gonna do that!

 
**Achilles:**
If I was ever going to do something like that,
it'd be as a Berserker!

 
**Atalante:**
Haha, I was just kidding.

 
**Atalante:**
...Since I am based on the data from before the Great Holy Grail War began, my Spirit Origin has no recollection of this...

 
**Atalante:**
...but I imagine we must have exchanged similar quips before, given that we were both part of the Red camp.

 
**Achilles:**
Yeah, we probably did.

 
**Achilles:**
You know, I was hoping I'd get to meet you someday.
My old man used to talk about you all the time.

 
**Atalante:**
...Stop that. It is embarrassing.

 
**Chiron:**
Ah, youth is such a splendid thing...

 
**Avicebron:**
I do not believe Servants are either truly old or young. ...Hmm.

 
**Chiron:**
Is something wrong?

 
**Avicebron:**
No, there's just something nagging me about Shakespeare.

 
**Chiron:**
Did you find some evidence that he is an imposter?

 
**Avicebron:**
No, nothing like that.

 
**Avicebron:**
What troubles me is that the enemy version of him decided to come to the fortress.

 
**Avicebron:**
If it had been any other Servant...

 
**Avicebron:**
...we might have faced eradication.

 
**Chiron:**
Hmm. I see.

 
**Chiron:**
...In that case, I'll speak to Master,
and see if we can't stay one step ahead.

 
**Sieg:**
All right.
...Let's go!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Good luck! May fortune smile on you all!

 
**Avicebron:**
I doubt you'll need us on the front lines anymore,
so I'll stay here and await your return.

 
**Avicebron:**
Along with my golems, of course.

 
**Jack:**
Okay Mommy, let's gooo!

 
**Chiron:**
Atalante.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We're counting on you!

 
**Atalante:**
Right.
To the twin gods I offer this...

 
**Atalante:**
Phoebus Catastrophe!

 
**Atalante:**
...Tch, a Noble Phantasm!

 
**Sieg:**
That must be Rider...Astolfo's Noble Phantasm.

 
**Sieg:**
His hippogriff can pass through any kind of attack.

 
**Atalante:**
In that case, we just continue to attack until it rematerializes. Come, Chiron!

 
**Chiron:**
Right there with you!

 
**Spartacus:**
There you are, oppressors! So you've decided to take cover in the night and strike at us from the shadows, have you!?

 
**Spartacus:**
That will not protect you from the destruction of my love!

 
**Spartacus:**
Good mooorniiing, rebellion!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Well, you've certainly got greetings covered...

 
**Achilles:**
...All right, let's split 'em up like we always&ndash;Huh!?

 
**Chiron:**
This...this is my Bounded Field!
So they DID learn how to separate us!

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg! Master!

 
**Sieg:**
...It seems Chiron was right about the enemy appearing within the fortress.

 
**Sieg:**
Assassin...I mean, Jack the Ripper.

 
**Jack:**
Yes, yes! We're here, Mr. Custodian.
What is it?

 
**Sieg:**
Can you tell me what the enemies you saw looked like?

 
**Jack:**
Okay. Let's see...

 
**Jack:**
There were two Sabers with heavy armor,
and a Lancer who seemed kind of girly...

 
**Jack:**
Hmm. Maybe he was actually a Rider?

 
**Sieg:**
If he was short, then he couldn't have been either of the two Lancers.

 
**Jack:**
Then he must've been the Rider of Black.

 
**Sieg:**
...I see.

 
**Jack:**
Oh, we also saw a few things that looked like Shadow Servants.

 
**Jack:**
We were there too, so we think...they're probably leftovers from last time or something?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
How strong were they?

 
**Jack:**
Not strong at all! They were easy!

 
**Jack:**
We can dismember all of them for you in no time!

 
**Sieg:**
All right, then we take out any enemies that make their way here, and continue to protect the Casters.

 
**Sieg:**
Since we expected something like this might happen,
we shouldn't have anything to worry about.

 
**Sieg:**
Fujimaru, go ahead and tell us what to do!

 
**Fran:**
Ugggh!

 
**Jack:**
We're counting on you, Mommy!
Okay, time to go ripping!

 
## Section 5: Chiron the Sage's Combat Exercise
 
**Jack:**
Dismembeeer!!! Wheee!!!

 
**Jack:**
We won!

 
**Fran:**
Ugh!

 
**Jack:**
Hooray!

 
**Sieg:**
The Rider of Black, Astolfo.
The Saber of Black, Siegfried.
The Saber of Red, Mordred.

 
**Sieg:**
I can confirm that they've all disappeared.

 
**Sieg:**
Truth be told, I have mixed feelings about this...
But at least we were able to outwit them and win.

 
**Sieg:**
I hate to think of what might have happened if Avicebron hadn't realized what they were up to...

 
**Sieg:**
...

 
**Fran:**
Uh!?

 
**Sieg:**
...I'm all right. I think my control over the Greater Grail just wavered a little bit.

 
**Sieg:**
It's odd, though, considering how many Servants we've defeated... Does this mean my ownership of the Grail wavering has nothing to do with this war?

 
**Jack:**
What happens when it wavers?

 
**Sieg:**
It means someone other than me will take possession of the Greater Grail.

 
**Jack:**
Hmm.

 
**Jack:**
If they want it that badly,
why don't you just let them have it?

 
**Jack:**
You're not even a Servant, right?
Why kill yourself over this?

 
**Sieg:**
A Servant once tried to use this Greater Grail to make a wish come true.

 
**Sieg:**
And I'm the one who stopped that from happening.

 
**Sieg:**
So, I guess...I kind of have a responsibility to make sure the Greater Grail is never misused.

 
**Jack:**
...We don't really understand, but okay.
It sounds like you had a hard life.

 
**Sieg:**
...I wouldn't say that. It may not have lasted long, but I enjoyed it.

 
**Sieg:**
Anyway, the battle is now over.

 
**Sieg:**
Fujimaru, do you know the Rider of Black...er, Astolfo?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Yup.
 
**Sieg:**
I see. Then you also know how...difficult he can be at times.

 
**Sieg:**
He's a lot of fun, too, though...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Nope.
 
**Sieg:**
I see... Well, try not to be too shocked by how he behaves.

 
**Sieg:**
He's easily the most unhinged out of all fourteen Servants.

 

 
**Sieg:**
Anyway, it's encouraging to know that both the Black and Red Sabers will soon be joining us.

 
**Sieg:**
Though I have to say, our “family”
is growing rather large...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I don't know if we can keep them all in line anymore.

 
**Sieg:**
I've been thinking the same thing.
Still, we'll just have to do our best.

 
**Narration::**
There can be no atonement for this sin.
I may be dooming him to a life of violence.

 
**Narration::**
But even so...I choose to offer up my life to him.

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Immortal body, sword-wielding fortress, Dragon-Slayer,
the hero who bears a thousand hopes upon his back.

 
**Narration::**
Siegfried.

 
**Narration::**
Don't worry about me. I don't care if I'm mistaken.
I don't care if I'm deluded. I'm fine with this.

 
**Narration::**
So don't worry about me.

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Knight of the Round Table, traitor, the one who ended the reign of King Arthur, hero of red lightning, usurper of the throne, curse of the King of Knights.

 
**Narration::**
Mordred.

 
**Narration::**
Yeah! Good luck to you too!

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
The legend of Charlemagne, troublemaker, absent of reason, devoted Samaritan, knight of miracles.

 
**Narration::**
Astolfo.

 
**Narration::**
Only three Servants left.
It won't be much longer now.

 
**Narration::**
...It will be a bit of a wait, though.

 
**Narration::**
I believe humans will make it here eventually, so I'm willing to wait until they do. Even if it takes a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years.

 
**Narration::**
Still, if I have any regrets...
Well, it would be nice to talk to someone.

 
**Narration::**
Homunculus, human, Servant...

 
**Narration::**
As long as we could just talk about anything,
really, I wouldn't care who it was with.

 
**Narration::**
...That wish already came true with astonishing ease.
I know so many things.

 
**Narration::**
I know their memories from the Great Holy Grail War.
I know all their data. I even know how each of them met their ends.

 
**Narration::**
Of course, there's no need to say any of that,
and I don't plan on doing so.

 
**Narration::**
It's just...none of the Servants who gathered here knew about the Great Holy Grail War.

 
**Narration::**
I'm guessing they don't have the data from it. They're the same as they were on the first day of the war.

 
**Astolfo:**
Hiya, people I've never met!

 
**Narration::**
...That explains why he reacted that way.
It's still kind of sad, though.

 
**Sieg:**
Nice to meet you.
You must be Astolfo.

 
**Sieg:**
And you two must be...

 
**Siegfried:**
...
...

 
**Mordred:**
...Well? What's goin' on here, Custodian?
Just give us the quick version, yeah?

 
**Sieg:**
Of course. I was just about to.

 
**Siegfried:**
I see. So that is why both the Black and Red camps have gathered here.

 
**Siegfried:**
Very well, I shall lend you my aid.

 
**Sieg:**
Thank you.

 
**Mordred:**
So this isn't the Great Holy Grail War?
Damn. What a drag.

 
**Achilles:**
Go ahead and sit the rest out if you want.
Not like one more Saber's gonna make a difference.

 
**Mordred:**
...What was that? You wanna fight or something, punk?

 
**Achilles:**
Hey, so you DO get it!

 
**Achilles:**
Things are getting worse by the day around here.
It's all we can do just to keep our heads above water.

 
**Achilles:**
If you're not gonna help us fight, then get lost.

 
**Mordred:**
...Now I get it. 'Course, it was pretty obvious just looking at you.

 
**Achilles:**
Oh yeah?

 
**Mordred:**
You're pissin' me off. C'mon. Let's go.
You and me. No weapons. Just fists.

 
**Achilles:**
Now you're talking...!

 
**Fran:**
Uhhh!!!

 
**Mordred:**
Hey! What was that for, Frankenstein!?
That really hurt!

 
**Mordred:**
Huh?
...Don't fight in the courtyard?

 
**Mordred:**
It's small, and if we fight, we'll kill the flowers?

 
**Fran:**
Uh!

 
**Mordred:**
...Tch.
Fine, whatever.

 
**Mordred:**
You heard her.
If we're gonna do this, we gotta take it outside.

 
**Achilles:**
...Eh, pass. Moment's gone.
She took all the fun out of it.

 
**Mordred:**
Oh yeah?

 
**Chiron:**
I'm glad to see such esteemed heroes getting along so well.

 
**Both:**
The hell we are!

 
**Chiron:**
Not to worry. You'll get along fine once you start fighting side by side, whether you like it or not.

 
**Chiron:**
And I will not take no for an answer.

 
**Atalante:**
Heh... It seems things worked out nicely.

 
**Achilles:**
Gimme a break...

 
**Mordred:**
Took the words right outta my mouth.
Now then.

 
**Mordred:**
Custodian, have you started losing ownership of the Greater Grail, or not?

 
**Sieg:**
I have, yes. I'm steadily losing control.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Why didn't you say so sooner!?

 
**Mordred:**
Then there's no point in fighting these guys off.

 
**Chiron:**
I see. Then what do you suggest?

 
**Mordred:**
Oh come the hell on. You're telling me the “Great Sage” hasn't figured this out? The only thing still left is the Hanging Gardens.

 
**Chiron:**
Yes, I suppose you're right. I'd been putting it off because of how dangerous it is...

 
**Chiron:**
...but now that we have this many capable fighters on our side, attacking it has become a viable option.

 
**Chiron:**
However, I believe the Hanging Gardens is the Assassin of Red...Semiramis's Noble Phantasm. Correct, Sir Sieg?

 
**Sieg:**
Yes.

 
**Sieg:**
As long as she's in that garden,
Semiramis is as powerful as a Ruler.

 
**Chiron:**
Back when we were fighting her,
all she did was just bombard us from her garden.

 
**Chiron:**
But, if we board the garden ourselves,
it will be a different matter.

 
**Chiron:**
All twelve of us will have to focus on defending ourselves when we're there.

 
**Chiron:**
Our chances of victory are...slim at best.

 
**Atalante:**
Why do we not simply attack now, before nightfall?

 
**Avicebron:**
I actually tried sending a flying golem in there yesterday, at Chiron's behest...

 
**Avicebron:**
...but as soon as night fell,
it was teleported back to the surface.

 
**Avicebron:**
So we believe that our enemy has already taken measures against a daytime attack.

 
**Achilles:**
Shoulda figured it wouldn't be that easy.

 
**Atalante:**
Yes, that WILL make this very difficult...

 
**Atalante:**
I have only seen it from a distance at night,
but its defenses are obviously quite formidable.

 
**Avicebron:**
Were you able to make it up there, Custodian?

 
**Sieg:**
Well... During the Great Holy Grail War,
the Black Team's Master's used stolen airplanes...

 
**Sieg:**
And Rider&ndash;Astolfo, that is... Well, he rode his hippogriff up to it, dodging its defenses all the way.

 
**Sieg:**
On top of that, our Ruler used a defensive skill that protected us from more than half of the bombardment Semiramis unleashed from her garden.

 
**Sieg:**
Right now, we have Achilles's chariot and Astolfo's hippogriff, but&ndash;

 
**Avicebron:**
I'm afraid it will be difficult to attack the garden with those alone.

 
**Avicebron:**
Convenient as it would be were she to simply open the garden's gates to us, I rather doubt she will be so accommodating. More likely, she will defend her garden quite fiercely.

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, Chiron, got any brilliant ideas to get us in there?

 
**Chiron:**
Such things are always useful when there is a weakness to exploit, but I am afraid no amount of planning or brilliance can break those defenses.

 
**Chiron:**
I'm afraid we may have no choice but to charge through the front door. Sir Sieg, is your true body recovered enough to be able to move?

 
**Sieg:**
...I've had it resting the last few days to focus on healing up.

 
**Sieg:**
If nothing else, it should be able to fly now.

 
**Sieg:**
But even so, breaking in will be difficult. If I take another Noble Phantasm, I'll fall right out of the sky.

 
**Sieg:**
Especially if it happens to be Siegfried's.

 
**Sieg:**
His Noble Phantasm is especially dangerous to me,
given that it slew a dragon.

 
**Sieg:**
Even the slightest scratch from it could send me crashing down.

 
**Siegfried:**
...I'm sorry I caused such trouble for you while I was on the opposing side.

 
**Fran:**
Ugh.

 
**Siegfried:**
...?

 
**Mordred:**
She says, “Don't worry 'bout it.”

 
**Chiron:**
Unfortunately, we have no choice but for you to fly if we are to assault the garden's front gates.

 
**Sieg:**
It's not that I'm scared...
Well, no, I guess I AM scared.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm scared I won't actually be able to do this&ndash;that I won't be able to get you there safely.

 
**Chiron:**
Oh? Apologies. It seems I was not clear. We will, of course, ALL be contributing to this frontal assault.

 
**Chiron:**
You may be the Greater Grail's Custodian, but I would never put this entirely on your shoulders alone.

 
**Achilles:**
In that case, Astolfo and I'll back you up,
since we can both fly too.

 
**Astolfo:**
Damn skippy we will!

 
**Astolfo:**
Don't worry, I promise we'll keep you and Fujimaru safe up there!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Then I'll stay here and watch the&ndash;On second thought, I'd better come along too. I'd be no match for those Dragon Tooth Warriors on my own.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, I'd better prepare a sonnet to sing the praises of you, our great heroes! That will surely make fortune smile upon you!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Now then, I'm off to write! Only a few hours left until deadline! Time to get that ink flowing, William!

 
**Avicebron:**
Hmm. In my case...I suppose I'll have some golems fly in front of the dragon, to act as his shield.

 
**Avicebron:**
If I make full use of the Millennia Fortress's walls for material, they should last at least a little while.

 
**Atalante:**
I suppose I could pick off any attackers with my bow...

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Atalante:**
Do you know something, Custodian?

 
**Sieg:**
Atalante, you, uh...
You have another Noble Phantasm.

 
**Sieg:**
I heard you used it to fly during the Great Holy Grail War.

 
**Atalante:**
...The Calydonian Boar's pelt!

 
**Atalante:**
I remember now. You are right.
There IS more than one way to use the boar's pelt.

 
**Atalante:**
Surprising that I would use it to try to win the war, though... I must have been quite desperate.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Can you still use it?

 
**Atalante:**
I will figure something out.

 
**Atalante:**
I do not know that I will be able to stay in the air for overly long, but I should be able to defy gravity for at least a short while.

 
**Jack:**
Mommy, Mommy.
Can we use our mist?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Mist?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You mean your second Noble Phantasm?

 
**Jack:**
Uh-huh.
It can...uh... What's the word again?

 
**Jack:**
You know, I can choose who it goes around.
Do you know what I mean, Mr. Horse Servant?

 
**Chiron:**
So you can freely select who your mist envelops...

 
**Chiron:**
That sounds like it can be directed, then.

 
**Jack:**
Yep! That's it.

 
**Sieg:**
...Aha, now I see.
So back then, that's how she&ndash;

 
**Jack:**
We're gonna ride on Mr. Custodian's back along with Mommy!

 
**Chiron:**
Yes, good point.
Avicebron, Shakespeare.

 
**Chiron:**
I'd like you two to ride on Fafnir's back as well.

 
**Fran:**
Ugh...

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, Frankenstein...
I mean, Berserker?

 
**Fran:**
Uh?

 
**Mordred:**
You and I are gonna team up,
so I want you staying put on the ground.

 
**Fran:**
Ugh?
Uh...?

 
**Mordred:**
Ah, don't worry so much!
I got a brilliant plan, trust me!

 
**Chiron:**
Is there a legend about you flying that I was unaware of?

 
**Mordred:**
Nah, nothing like that. Don't worry, though.
I'll figure something out!

 
**Mordred:**
Long as we get up there, it doesn't matter how, right?
I'll get us there! Just you watch!

 
**Mordred:**
We'll go shooting up there like a rocket!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So...you're going to explode?
 
**Mordred:**
Hell no!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You mean you're gonna use your Ma
 
**Mordred:**
Shh.

 
**Mordred:**
That's a damn secret, okay?

 
**Fran:**
Uh...?

 

 
**Sieg:**
What about you, Siegfried, Chiron, and Spartacus?
What will you guys do?

 
**Siegfried:**
Good question...

 
**Chiron:**
I'll accompany Achilles in his chariot.
Assuming that's all right with you?

 
**Achilles:**
Fine by me.

 
**Achilles:**
Chariots aren't made for just one rider anyway.

 
**Astolfo:**
Wanna ride on my hippogriff with me, Siegfried?
I'm sure we can find room for one more!

 
**Siegfried:**
...It would seem that is my only option.

 
**Siegfried:**
I'll make sure to defend against the other me's Noble Phantasm.

 
**Achilles:**
Guess that just leaves this guy.
Hey, Spartacus.

 
**Spartacus:**
I refuse.

 
**Achilles:**
Why!?

 
**Spartacus:**
You bear the stink of oppressors.
Now that I know our destination, I will find my own way!

 
**Spartacus:**
Nothing is impossible for me.
The sky is but one more obstacle to be overcome.

 
**Sieg:**
Please calm down.

 
**Sieg:**
Spartacus, you may be a Servant, but I don't believe you have any skills or Noble Phantasms that would let you fly.

 
**Spartacus:**
Nothing is impossible in this world.

 
**Spartacus:**
If birds are capable of flight,
then humans must be as well.

 
**Spartacus:**
If I must become a bird to reach the garden,
then that is what I shall do.

 
**Spartacus:**
Yes, I shall be a small, elegant bird,
soaring gracefully across the sky...

 
**Chiron:**
A-a bird, you say...?

 
**Spartacus:**
Cock-a-doodle-doooooo!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Welp, you won't be soaring...

 
**Atalante:**
...Well, you cannot expect to become a bird overnight, Spartacus. If I were a bird, I would be insulted to hear you think it such a trivial thing to do.

 
**Atalante:**
Perhaps we could send a rope down for you? With muscles like that, you should have no trouble climbing up to the garden.

 
**Spartacus:**
...
...You are no oppressor...

 
**Mordred:**
What the hell does this lunkhead use to figure out what's an oppressor anyway?

 
**Chiron:**
Good.
Now we all have a plan to reach the garden.

 
**Spartacus:**
Indeed.

 
**Chiron:**
...Probably.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
We're fine... Yeah... Toootally fine...

 
**Spartacus:**
I will prove to you that my muscles are truly worthy of your absolute trust.

 
**Chiron:**
All right, then. You three new Servants will officially join our battle lineup.

 
**Chiron:**
Our next step is get you acclimated to working with [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru as a team.

 
**Astolfo:**
Sounds good to me!

 
**Siegfried:**
Understood.

 
**Mordred:**
Aw, c'mon. Really? Do I gotta?
I already know how to fight just fine.

 
**Chiron:**
Indeed. I am certain a warrior of your skill can manage quite capably.

 
**Chiron:**
But working with a team requires more than mere combat skill alone.

 
**Chiron:**
Besides, there's nothing better than the feeling one gets after landing a beautiful team combo.

 
**Chiron:**
All the more so when it happens in live combat,
rather than in practice.

 
**Mordred:**
...All right. I guess I could give it a shot.

 
**Sieg:**
(She's like putty in his hands...!)

 
**Astolfo:**
'kay then, I'll go first!
Looking forward to fighting with ya, Custodian!

 
**Sieg:**
Thank you. The pleasure's all mine.

 
**Chiron:**
Avicebron, would you mind creating some training golems?

 
**Avicebron:**
Very well.

 
**Chiron:**
All right, Astolfo, focus on teamwork,
and do not run off on your own.

 
**Astolfo:**
Aye, aye, sir!

 
**Chiron:**
I will offer advice, but nothing more.
Good luck, you two.

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Astolfo:**
Wooowie! I'm all tuckered out!
Bleeeah.

 
**Chiron:**
Teamwork is an excellent way to compensate for one's weaknesses, but it can also greatly enhance your strengths as well.

 
**Chiron:**
Try to keep that in mind once the fighting begins in earnest.

 
**Astolfo:**
'kaaay!

 
**Chiron:**
Siegfried, you're up next.

 
**Siegfried:**
Right.

 
**Chiron:**
Most of your opponents' attacks will be focused on you, Siegfried.

 
**Chiron:**
You may block them, heal from them, evade them, trade places with another... You are, in short, free to handle this however you see fit.

 
**Chiron:**
Well then, here we go!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Siegfried:**
Now I see.
This is nice.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Something wrong?

 
**Sieg:**
Oh, no, everything's fine.

 
**Sieg:**
I guess I just got caught up in the moment...
Let's keep going.

 
**Chiron:**
Last, but certainly not least: Mordred.

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, yeah, fine. This teamwork stuff's a pain in the ass. I'm just gonna go nuts.

 
**Chiron:**
That's perfectly fine.
We will simply follow your lead.

 
**Mordred:**
Wait, really? You will?

 
**Chiron:**
Of course. Rampaging about like a Berserker seems to suit you rather well.

 
**Mordred:**
Well, hey, how 'bout that. Guess I don't gotta worry about you clowns. I like that!

 
**Mordred:**
Okay, Master, what do you say we get this party started!?

 
**Chiron:**
Are you two ready?

 
**Chiron:**
Mordred appears to be well suited to quick, decisive battles, so let's try to hit the opponent as hard and fast as we possibly can.

 
**Chiron:**
Your goal will be to take out the heavy golems before they can become a threat. All right, begin!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...Damn, that was close!
These golems are way tougher than I thought!

 
**Mordred:**
But I'll finish these jerks off!

 
**Chiron:**
Brilliant work.

 
**Mordred:**
Aw yeah, piece of cake!

 
**Sieg:**
Have you got a handle on how all three teams operate now?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Definitely.
 
**Sieg:**
Great. Then let's take a break.

 
**Sieg:**
We still have some time until the sun sets and the Hanging Gardens shows itself.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I could still use a little more time.
 
**Sieg:**
I see... Then let's discuss our teamwork a little more, shall we?

 
**Sieg:**
We should still have enough time for that.

 

 
**Chiron:**
I'm afraid we will need to leave this fortress behind. If you have any unfinished business here, now is the time to take care of it.

 
**Fran:**
Uh...

 
**Sieg:**
I'm sorry, Frankenstein. Well...you could pick some flowers to take with you, right?

 
**Fran:**
Uh!

 
**Mordred:**
Aw, look at her, all excited...

 
**Sieg:**
You two really are good friends.

 
**Mordred:**
Who, us? Eh, it's pretty simple.

 
**Mordred:**
We're a lot alike.

 
**Sieg:**
You are...?

 
**Mordred:**
Forget it.

 
**Mordred:**
Anyway, what about you and the Saber of Black?
You got some kinda problem with Siegfried?

 
**Sieg:**
No, nothing like that.
At least, not as he is now.

 
**Mordred:**
Aw, really? And here I was thinking he must've handed you your ass back during the other war or something.

 
**Sieg:**
That's...

 
**Siegfried:**
Sir Custodian, may I have a word with you?

 
**Sieg:**
With me...?

 
**Sieg:**
Okay.
What's this about?

 
**Siegfried:**
It seems none of us has any memory of the Great Holy Grail War we once fought here...

 
**Sieg:**
That's right. I think you've all been summoned from the records leading up to it.

 
**Sieg:**
Usually, your memories would be engraved in the Throne of Heroes, but the versions of you here right now are not actually complete.

 
**Sieg:**
Alternatively, someone might have sealed them away on purpose. Perhaps whoever is orchestrating all this.

 
**Siegfried:**
I'm told you still have your memories of the war, Sir Custodian. If that's true, I have a question for you...

 
**Sieg:**
Of course.
...Anything.

 
**Siegfried:**
Did I stay true to myself?

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Sieg:**
I... I'm afraid I can't answer that.

 
**Siegfried:**
I see. That's all right. I was just curious.

 
**Siegfried:**
No need to give it further thought.

 
**Siegfried:**
Now that I've been summoned here, whatever grudges I may have held in the past are of no importance.

 
**Siegfried:**
I will simply fight to the best of my ability.

 
**Sieg:**
Thank you.
That will be a huge help.

 
**Siegfried:**
That said, I still find it hard to believe that you are this evil dragon, Sir Custodian...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I think you bathed in this dragon's blood once, right?

 
**Siegfried:**
I did. ...I only hope I need never fight such a battle again.

 
**Siegfried:**
It is too terrible to recall...but the feeling of it is forever etched into my soul.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm, uh... I'm sorry...

 
**Siegfried:**
?

 
**Siegfried:**
What is it, Master of Chaldea?
You look terribly embarrassed.

 
**Siegfried:**
An apology?

 
**Siegfried:**
Hmm, I don't know what it is you are sorry for...
But I promise you, I'm fine. You needn't worry about me.

 
**Siegfried:**
You are a Master, a crystallization of the future.

 
**Siegfried:**
If you deem my aid necessary,
I would be glad to lend it to you.

 
**Sieg:**
I, uh, I see.

 
**Sieg:**
So Siegfried fought a different Fafnir in Orleans...

 
**Sieg:**
...Don't worry, Fujimaru.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm sure he meant it when he said he never wanted to fight a battle like that again...

 
**Sieg:**
...but I doubt a hero like him would let something like that stop him from stepping up when he's needed.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm sure he'll do whatever he has to.
All the more so if the fate of humanity is at stake.

 
**Sieg:**
After all, he's the sort of man who would risk his life just to save a homunculus like me...

 
**Sieg:**
He even put me ahead of his own desires,
and those of the person he had pledged to fight.

 
**Sieg:**
He ended up throwing all that away, because of me.

 
**Sieg:**
I don't regret doing what I had to do to survive.
But, I guess...

 
**Sieg:**
...Hmm, it's hard to explain.

 
**Sieg:**
I wanted to survive, and I want Siegfried to continue fighting.

 
**Sieg:**
I feel like those two desires contradict each other,
but then again, maybe they don't...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Do you feel guilty or something?

 
**Sieg:**
...Yes, I suppose I do.

 
**Sieg:**
After I became the Greater Grail's Custodian, I learned a lot of things I would have been happier not knowing.

 
**Sieg:**
Among them were things that happened without me having been aware at the time.

 
**Sieg:**
...The last Servant Atalante fought was Achilles.

 
**Sieg:**
Frankenstein was forced to use her Noble Phantasm's full power when she fought with Mordred, even though she knew doing so would be suicide.

 
**Sieg:**
And...a great hero like Siegfried gave up his heart, all to save my life.

 
**Sieg:**
They fought long and hard to acquire the Holy Grail.
All of their wishes were pure and righteous.

 
**Sieg:**
But in the end, I was the one who ended up with the Greater Grail.

 
**Sieg:**
...Ever since then, I've been wondering whether I did the right thing or not.

 
**Sieg:**
What would you have done? Would you have been able to accept a wish like that, and allowed the Greater Grail to grant it?

 
**Sieg:**
Or would you have made the same choice I did?

 
**Sieg:**
Or...would you have taken another option?
One I didn't see at the time...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'd have had to be there myself.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
That's really hard to say.

 
**Sieg:**
Right. That makes sense.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...Hm?

 
**Sieg:**
That's weird. It's not as though my problem has been resolved, but...

 
**Sieg:**
...for some reason, I feel a bit better now.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Maybe you just needed to talk about it?

 
**Sieg:**
...That could be it.

 
**Sieg:**
It's hard to repress the urge to talk. Maybe that's not so surprising, since I've manifested as a terminal.

 
**Sieg:**
We still have some time before we leave for the Hanging Gardens. Would it be okay if we talk a little more?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Of course!

 
**Sieg:**
Thank you.
In that case...

 
**Sieg:**
...I'd love to hear about the Servants you know. Without violating their privacy, of course.

 
**Sieg:**
...I see.
So you know a ninja, huh?

 
**Sieg:**
Mechanical?
But...she's not a robot, then?

 
**Sieg:**
I had no idea they had the technology back then to create a machine capable of becoming a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Sieg:**
I guess ninja really are something else.

 
**Sieg:**
So Divine Spirits have materialized in your world? I see. I guess that makes sense, given the crisis humanity is facing.

 
**Sieg:**
Huh? The goddess of virginity and the moon that Atalante worships is actually a besotted romantic?

 
**Sieg:**
And Orion...is a tiny teddy bear?
...Are they even strong?

 
**Sieg:**
...I would think that being loved by so many people is a good thing.

 
**Sieg:**
So why do you look so exhausted?

 
**Sieg:**
It's a heavy weight to carry?
I wasn't aware love had mass.

 
**Sieg:**
I guess I still have a lot to learn...

 
**Sieg:**
Blackbeard.
The pirate.

 
**Sieg:**
I see. I understand now.
That one is beyond understanding.

 
**Sieg:**
Thank you for sharing all that.
Chaldea...sounds like a lot of fun.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Can't you come to visit?

 
**Sieg:**
I'm afraid not.

 
**Sieg:**
It might be possible, but even if it was, I'm obligated to stay here and take care of the Greater Grail.

 
**Sieg:**
Once this battle is over, I'm going to stay here. I'm...waiting for someone to show up.

 
**Sieg:**
That's the one decision I can't change.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I see. That's too bad...

 
**Sieg:**
If it was difficult or painful to do that,
I might not be able to handle it.

 
**Sieg:**
But it's just a long wait, so it's no trouble at all.

 
**Sieg:**
Still...it's nice of you to be concerned about me.
I appreciate that.

 
**Sieg:**
I was worried I might have upset you, summoning you out here all of a sudden like this.

 
**Sieg:**
...The next battle is going to be for the Hanging Gardens.

 
**Sieg:**
Avicebron said he would make a saddle for you,
so make sure you hold on tight to that.

 
**Sieg:**
But even if you fall,
I'm sure one of the heroes will save you.

 
**Sieg:**
It could be Astolfo, Achilles,
Atalante, or Avicebron...

 
**Sieg:**
...but whoever it is,
I'm certain one of them will save you if you need it.

 
**Sieg:**
Anyway, we'd better get back.
We need to get ready to leave too.

 
## Section 6: A Dreamlike Moment
 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Guess I won't be seeing THIS room again...

 
**Sieg:**
No, probably not.

 
**Sieg:**
...Would you like one last thing to eat before we go?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
No, that's all right.
 
**Sieg:**
Okay. In that case, we might as well clean the place up a bit.

 
**Sieg:**
...Hm? I think I hear the Servants calling me.

 
**Sieg:**
Hang on, I'll be right back.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Sure, that sounds good.
 
**Sieg:**
Okay, just sit tight.
I'll be back with some food soon.

 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What's keeping him...?

 
**Astolfo:**
Whooo's ready for a picnic!?

 
**Mordred:**
Not a damn picnic!

 
**Mordred:**
Aw, crap.
He's stronger than he looks...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Wh-what's this all about?

 
**Sieg:**
Rider&ndash;Astolfo said he wanted to have a picnic in the courtyard.

 
**Sieg:**
That it was worth celebrating so many Servants getting together like this, even if we're still missing three.

 
**Astolfo:**
What I REALLY said was, “What's the harm?
You ARE hungry, right? Come on, let's do it!”

 
**Astolfo:**
And the rest is history.

 
**Mordred:**
What...No it isn't!
What are you talking about!?

 
**Fran:**
Ugh!

 
**Astolfo:**
Right!?

 
**Mordred:**
Hey! Don't you go turning Fran against me!

 
**Fran:**
Ugh, ugh!

 
**Sieg:**
...Well... Here we all are, out in the courtyard,
having sandwiches together...

 
**Sieg:**
Having everyone here together is...a bit of a surprise, really.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You said it.

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, gimme that one. I'm not eating any of that egg salad shit! I want some MEAT!

 
**Astolfo:**
But you're eating it already! AND you tried to steal my sandwich without even asking!

 
**Fran:**
Uh, uh♪

 
**Spartacus:**
Sandwiches...trap meat and other food...
Does this mean...bread is an oppressor...?

 
**Avicebron:**
Even if it were, you can't just eat the sandwich's insides. Then you'd be oppressing the bread.

 
**Atalante:**
Hmm.
Strawberry custard...

 
**Atalante:**
This is very sweet.
Children would love this.

 
**Jack:**
Mmm, yummy!

 
**Atalante:**
As I thought.

 
**Jack:**
Strawberries taste like blood!
Both're really sweet!

 
**Atalante:**
I, um...do not think that is true...?
In fact, they are...ah...really quite different.

 
**Jack:**
You sure?

 
**Siegfried:**
Hmm. These would make perfect battlefield rations.

 
**Siegfried:**
You can eat them in one bite,
and they provide excellent, balanced nutrition.

 
**Siegfried:**
...Not that we require nutrition as Servants,
but old habits die hard.

 
**Mordred:**
Nothing wrong with thinking that way!

 
**Mordred:**
My king never batted an eye at whatever she ate,
no matter how bad it tasted.

 
**Mordred:**
It was like she didn't care one damn bit about flavor, just the nutrients! I'll take your approach over cold efficiency any day!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Maybe she was actually something of a gourmand?
 
**Mordred:**
My father?

 
**Mordred:**
That inhuman old fool? Hah! Gimme a break!

 
**Mordred:**
If she turns out to be a gourmand,
then I'll eat every one of Gawain's “dishes” myself!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
You sure she didn't actually want to eat good food?
 
**Mordred:**
Hell no.

 
**Mordred:**
It didn't matter HOW good the food was!
She'd always just give that same disinterested, “Mmm...”

 
**Mordred:**
If she actually did give a shit about food, I'll eat every one of Gawain's mashed “specials” myself!

 

 
**Astolfo:**
(Ooh, I think I just heard a branch opening up!)

 
**Chiron:**
...
...

 
**Chiron:**
...Mmm. These came out rather well,
if I do say so myself.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You made these, Teacher?

 
**Chiron:**
I did, yes, though Sieg was kind enough to procure the ingredients for me.

 
**Sieg:**
I could never make something this good on my own.

 
**Mordred:**
...Dammit, these ARE good.
Ugh, is there anything this guy CAN'T do?

 
**Achilles:**
Hell no there isn't.
My teacher's not a great sage for nothing!

 
**Mordred:**
...Can he hold a crucifix for an hour straight?

 
**Achilles:**
You bet. He can do one-finger push-ups without breaking a sweat, too.

 
**Atalante:**
Can he shoot an apple off the head of an evil chancellor?

 
**Achilles:**
In his sleep. He could shoot the chancellor too, while he was at it.

 
**Astolfo:**
Can he shoot vacuum blades just by cracking his knuckles?

 
**Achilles:**
Easily. They'll go through anything like a hot knife through butter.

 
**Siegfried:**
How long can he hold his breath while still acting at full strength?

 
**Achilles:**
As long as it takes for his opponent to keel over!

 
**Jack:**
Is he a mommy?

 
**Achilles:**
Raising kids is what he does best!

 
**Fran:**
Ugh?
(Can he come back to life with lightning?)

 
**Achilles:**
I'm not sure, but I bet he'd find a way!

 
**Chiron:**
...You really mustn't go around making such outlandish claims, Achilles. Though I suppose it bears mentioning that I could indeed manage some of those.

 
**Sieg:**
Oh, you can, huh...
Well, you certainly look like you could.

 
**Chiron:**
I admit that I can do most things better than the average person, but I cannot be the best.

 
**Chiron:**
I could not win against Achilles or Atalante in a footrace, nor could I defeat Spartacus in a contest of strength.

 
**Chiron:**
Indeed, I doubt I could defeat any of you in the areas of your respective specialties.

 
**Chiron:**
Archery may be my specialty, but even there I could never defeat, say, the likes of Arash Kamangir, who split the earth itself.

 
**Chiron:**
I am a teacher, not a hero.
I am not meant to stand above others.

 
**Chiron:**
In that sense, Achilles is not my only pupil here.

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.

 
**Chiron:**
I consider both of you to be my pupils as well.

 
**Chiron:**
I only wish we had more time together.
There are so many other things I wish I could teach you...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Come to Chaldea!
 
**Chiron:**
Hahaha, I'll have to think about that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I know a girl who'd love to learn from you, too.
 
**Chiron:**
Oho.
Mash Kyrielight, hm?

 
**Chiron:**
I see, I see. It sounds like I already have quite the formidable rival teacher.

 

 
**Chiron:**
At any rate, if we are ever summoned to Chaldea,
it will be as our true selves.

 
**Chiron:**
I expect, should that come to pass, that I will have learned all manner of new things, and may even be able to teach you more as well.

 
**Mordred:**
Are you freakin' kidding me with this shit?

 
**Mordred:**
There's no point continuing to study and stuff once you're a Servant, right?

 
**Sieg:**
...Not the way I see it.

 
**Sieg:**
After all, I know someone who kept learning even after they became a Servant.

 
**Mordred:**
Oh really? Who?

 
**Sieg:**
...I'm afraid I can't tell you.
I wasn't actually there, you see.

 
**Sieg:**
But I do know that hero never stopped moving forward.
That much, I can say for absolute certain.

 
**Sieg:**
...All right, it's going to be night soon.

 
**Sieg:**
I hate to say it, but it's time to bring this picnic to a close.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Thank you for the wonderful meal.

 
**Sieg:**
Of course.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Evil Dragon:**
I guess it's three minutes until we storm the gardens.
Is everyone ready!?

 
**Chiron:**
No issues here.

 
**Atalante:**
...This outfit seems a bit...much, no?
It feels more like a swimsuit than a suit of armor.

 
**Atalante:**
Personally, I much prefer my normal attire...

 
**Achilles:**
I think you look great!
I don't see a problem at all!

 
**Atalante:**
I was not asking you.
...Still, I suppose I can make do, since it allows me to fly.

 
**Astolfo:**
Wahahahaha!
I wish someone could take a picture of this!

 
**Siegfried:**
Indeed. ...How you doing there, Hippogriff?
I hope I'm not too heavy for you.

 
**Astolfo:**
He says you're very heavy.

 
**Siegfried:**
That figures!

 
**Achilles:**
Man, looking at this thing up close,
it's absurdly freaking large!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
We'll soon be entering the garden's firing range. Everyone, make sure to evade or block the Tiamtum Ūmu like your life depends on it!

 
**Avicebron:**
All right, now seems a good time to make my golem shield.
My body is a red shield...Gevurah Armadura!

 
**Astolfo:**
Hippogriff...dimension evade!

 
**Achilles:**
All right, we'd better&ndash;

 
**A：???:**
Oh, I just had a revelation.

 
**Chiron:**
Oh?
Who was that...?

 
**Achilles:**
Xanthos.
What do you want?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Is that horse talking...!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah yes, that is Xanthos. One of the divine steeds that Poseidon himself gave to Achilles.

 
**Shakespeare:**
I believe it is also the only one of the three that can talk.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
I was just thinking.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
How come you and Lord Chiron are the only ones not on the enemy side, Lord Achilles?

 
**Achilles:**
...Is that really important right now?

 
**A：Xanthus:**
It is, yes.

 
**Achilles:**
All right then, let's hear it.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
...I think you two must have been quite expensive.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
That's not to say Lady Mordred, Lord Siegfried,
and Lord Karna weren't expensive as well, of course.

 
**Chiron:**
What do you mean by expensive?

 
**A：Xanthus:**
You know, like in a strategy game.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
In games like that,
it is very expensive to create powerful units.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
First you have to work your way up the tech tree,
and that takes a long time on its own.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
And all this time, our opponent in this game,
this Great Holy Grail War within the Greater Grail...

 
**A：Xanthus:**
...has been laying the groundwork to produce the most powerful units possible.

 
**A：Xanthus:**
No doubt whoever it is put in a lot of hard work.
So, if this opponent is in the Hanging Gardens now...

 
**A：Xanthus:**
...then of course, they'll be waiting for the right time to use their new units. This just occurred to me.

 
**Chiron:**
...Setting aside how you even know what a strategy game is...

 
**Chiron:**
...I must admit that is a strong possibility.
In which case, our first move will have to be...

 
**Chiron:**
Achilles.

 
**Achilles:**
Y-yeah?
What is it, Teacher?

 
**Chiron:**
I want you to neutralize the other side's Achilles.
I'll do the same with their Chiron.

 
**Achilles:**
...Aw, c'mon, Teacher.
Xanthos has a history of blowing smoke up your&ndash;

 
**Achilles:**
...Okay, yep.
That was me, all right...

 
**Chiron:**
It would seem he was right on the money.

 
**Chiron:**
Everyone? Your attention, if I may?

 
**Chiron:**
My Noble Phantasm has no telegraph or tell of any kind. If the enemy Chiron uses it on you, I'm afraid you'll just have to trust in your luck.

 
**Atalante:**
You may as well tell us to roll over and die!
(↑ Luck rank: E)

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yeah.
That is hardly encouraging advice.

 
**Shakespeare:**
My, my. At long last,
the battle with all fourteen Servants will begin!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Though we yet lack the Assyrian empress AND the great hero of India!

 
**Shakespeare:**
To say nothing of the enemy having the Hanging Gardens to serve as their airborne fortress!

 
**Shakespeare:**
...Do we really have a hope of winning this?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
You're the great writer!
Figure something out!

 
**Avicebron:**
...Their assault is relentless!

 
**Astolfo:**
Hang on. Where the hell are Mordred and Fran!?
Oh, and Spartacus, I guess.

 
**Mordred:**
All right then.

 
**Fran:**
Uh?

 
**Mordred:**
Huh? You wanna know my plan to get us up there?

 
**Mordred:**
It's simple.
I'm gonna blast up there with my Mana Burst.

 
**Fran:**
Ugh?

 
**Mordred:**
Then there was no point in you staying behind?
'Course there was!

 
**Mordred:**
See, even with my Mana Burst,
it's gonna be tough getting all the way up there myself.

 
**Mordred:**
But not with you here.

 
**Fran:**
Ugh!?

 
**Mordred:**
You got it.
Your Noble Phantasm's all about lightning too, right?

 
**Mordred:**
So if we both power each other up, then boom!
We're in business!

 
**Fran:**
Ugh...

 
**Mordred:**
Don't worry, it'll be fine! If we don't make it up there, all that'll happen is we'll crash right back down to the ground.

 
**Fran:**
Uh...

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, right.
Can't have this armor weighing me down.

 
**Mordred:**
There we go.
Now, let's do this thing!

 
**Fran:**
Uh...

 
**Mordred:**
One, two...THREE!

 
**Avicebron:**
Hmm. So much for my shield.

 
**Karna:**
...
...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It's Karna...!

 
**Jack:**
We'll make some mist...!

 
**Jack:**
He keeps blowing it away!
This is why we hate really powerful Servants!

 
**Avicebron:**
I suppose we have no choice but for me to take the field. Shakespeare, you will be the next sacrifice after the five seconds it takes him to kill me.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Wait!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I don't mind throwing my life away if there's no other choice, but we must have SOME alternative we have not yet tried before it comes to that!

 
**Avicebron:**
Hmm.
...I suppose you're right.

 
**Avicebron:**
Say, for instance if someone capable of saving us were to suddenly fall from the sky like a shooting star.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Did anyone else just notice a flash of light from the groun

 
**Karna:**
...?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Something just shot up, sent Karna flying,
and smacked into the Hanging Gardens...didn't it...?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...I don't want to think too hard about it, but...I wonder if it might not have been Mordred and Fran...

 
**Mordred:**
...(Gasp!)

 
**Mordred:**
...Aw shit, close one. But also kinda awesome. For a second there, I saw Father's hand reaching out for me.

 
**Fran:**
...That...was...awful...!

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, you actually talked!

 
**Fran:**
So...reckless!

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, don't sweat it!
What matters is that we made it here!

 
**Mordred:**
Woo! Yeah, time to SMASH!
That oughta help all the other slowpokes catch up!

 
**Fran:**
Uh...
UhhhhhhAAAAAAHHH!!!

 
**Mordred:**
Whoa, hey!
I didn't mean right this secon&ndash;Ah, dammit...

 
**Mordred:**
Eh, screw it. Might as well kick this party off with my Noble Phantasm!

 
**Mordred:**
...Clarent Blood Arthur!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
That was reckless and ridiculous, but it was very helpful! Now's our chance to head inside the gardens.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I'll switch back to my terminal after we land.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Are you sure it's okay to leave this body unattended?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Without my soul inside it,
it's basically an oversized monster costume.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It'd be kind of annoying if it were destroyed,
but if it comes to that, I'll just make a new one!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Good, we made it.
Now to switch back...!

 
**Sieg:**
...There we go.
Now come on, let's hurry.

 
**Sieg:**
The Assassin of Red, Semiramis.
The Lancer of Red, Karna.

 
**Sieg:**
And the Lancer of Black, Vlad III.

 
**Sieg:**
Since we have other Servants on our side,
we'll have to defeat them, no matter what.

 
**Sieg:**
...It's possible these three are the ones seeking the Greater Grail.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Even Karna...?

 
**Sieg:**
True, that would be very out of character,
so it's probably not Karna.

 
**Sieg:**
If there's anyone who wants the Greater Grail more than anything...

 
**Sieg:**
...it would have to be that other man.

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, there they are.
'Sup, Custodian?

 
**Fran:**
Uhhh...

 
**Sieg:**
So you're all right...
How about you, Frankenstein? Are you okay?

 
**Fran:**
Never...again.
Ever.

 
**Sieg:**
(Wow! It was so bad it actually got her to speak...!)

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, just 'cause our opponents can think doesn't mean they can really THINK, right?

 
**Mordred:**
Best they can do is some normal,
orthodox planning, y'know?

 
**Mordred:**
So I figured if we hit them with a reckless, batshit insane plan like mine, where one false step would get you killed, they'd HAVE to fall for it!

 
**Sieg:**
So you actually thought that far ahead...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I'm not sure I'd call it “thinking”...
 
**Mordred:**
Well it was, dammit!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I'm thinking this was dumb luck. Like, really dumb luck.
 
**Fran:**
Uh, uh!
(Vigorous nod)

 

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, we're up against that bitchy empress who owns these gardens, right?

 
**Mordred:**
Not really sure why,
but that lady seriously pisses me off!

 
**Mordred:**
Besides, even if we'd been on the same team during the war, I bet we'd have been at each other's throats the entire time anyway!

 
**Sieg:**
(She's certainly got that right.)

 
**Mordred:**
All right, Master of Chaldea!

 
**Mordred:**
Just point us at whoever's face we need to smash in!

 
## Section 7: Decisive Battle: Hanging Gardens
 
**Mordred:**
Get...OUTTA HERE!

 
**Mordred:**
All right!

 
**Mordred:**
Fujimaru!
Hold out your fist!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
M-my fist?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Okay?

 
**Mordred:**
We won! Hell yeah! WINNER, WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER!!! Awww yeah!

 
**Fran:**
Uh?

 
**Sieg:**
...Is your hand okay?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
I-I dunno... I can't...feel it anymore...
 
**Sieg:**
I think Mordred just sort of...forgot you're a normal human.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Forget “okay.” Do...do I still have a hand?
 
**Fran:**
Uh, uh.
(You do.)

 

 
**Spartacus:**
I have ascended!

 
**Jack:**
Mr. Muscleman! It's about time!
Hiya.

 
**Siegfried:**
...I can't believe you actually climbed all the way here during that fierce battle...

 
**Jack:**
That rope held up really well!

 
**Spartacus:**
Indeed. It is a rope with a rebellious spirit!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Are you okay? Can you still fight?

 
**Spartacus:**
Rebelling against oppressors is my greatest love AND greatest power!

 
**Sieg:**
It'll be morning soon...but the Hanging Gardens are still here, just like we thought they'd be.

 
**Sieg:**
I'm guessing the Assassin of Red joined our side after we won that last battle.

 
**Sieg:**
Which means these gardens belong to both our enemy, and our ally.

 
**Semiramis:**
Right you are.
Your plan was rash, but successful.

 
**Sieg:**
...There you are.
The Assassin of Red, Semiramis.

 
**Semiramis:**
I have a fairly good idea of what's going on here.

 
**Semiramis:**
It was your negligence that led to this situation.
Wasn't it, Custodian?

 
**Sieg:**
...You may be right.

 
**Sieg:**
The last wish remaining in this Greater Grail was one that should never be granted, but it was also nobler than any other wish had ever been.

 
**Sieg:**
I never thought about touching it myself.
I couldn't have even if I wanted to.

 
**Semiramis:**
That explains it.

 
**Semiramis:**
No wonder a mere human, a mere mage,
a mere Master, made it so far then.

 
**Chiron:**
...Does that mean you know who our enemy is?

 
**Semiramis:**
Oh yes, I know him all too well. I may not have my memories of the war either, but I do have these gardens.

 
**Semiramis:**
As such, it was a trivial matter to learn of him.

 
**Semiramis:**
Ahh, it seems another has been revived.

 
**Karna:**
...Forgive me. We really made you work back there.

 
**Siegfried:**
Don't worry about it. I will admit, though, that your attack was so powerful, it's almost a shame we're on the same side now.

 
**Karna:**
Thank you.
Indeed, I wish we could have had a proper battle.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Semiramis:**
All of you, come with me. Now that thirteen of us have been revived, night and day no longer matter.

 
**Semiramis:**
Our enemy awaits us before the Greater Grail.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Our enemy?

 
**Semiramis:**
Yes, our enemy.
A man, Master of Chaldea.

 
**Semiramis:**
The only Master other than you in this entire world.

 
**Narration::**
I have lost. Leave me be, and continue onward.
I regret that I have no gift for you apart from my defeat.

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
Armor of gold, godkiller lance, lone kshatriya of the great Mahabharata, warrior, brave, Hero of Benefaction.

 
**Narration::**
Karna.

 
**Narration::**
But...I am tired now. Tired enough even to forgive your deception. ...What's more, I have lost.

 
**Narration::**
...Captured.

 
**Narration::**
The oldest known poisoner, the empress as dreadful as she is beautiful, the queen of Assyria who desired not love, but power.

 
**Narration::**
Semiramis.

 
**Narration::**
Thirteen Servants in total. And now, I have perfect reproduction data for all of them.

 
**Narration::**
...Enough to begin the Great Holy Grail War once again.

 
**Narration::**
Soon, I will reach the number of battles needed to shut down the wish made upon the Grail...

 
**Narration::**
...and tamper with it myself.

 
**Narration::**
...I reach out my hand, over and over and over.

 
**E：???:**
I copied thirteen Servants, created shadows,
and set the stage as best I could.

 
**E：???:**
I am the only one left, and now,
I shall become the final Servant.

 
**E：???:**
My control over the system has reached eighty-seven percent. More than enough to grant my wish.

 
**E：???:**
And yet... And yet, and yet, and yet...!

 
**E：???:**
I am unable to speak my wish aloud!

 
**E：???:**
You... You would still resist me...!?

 
**Semiramis:**
Of course. Under normal circumstances, this system would not even grant the likes of you an audience.

 
**Semiramis:**
It matters not how many years it was in your possession. It was another, far greater mage who did the work, not you.

 
**Semiramis:**
Enough is enough, you cheap imitation of Vlad III.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Imitation?
 
**Semiramis:**
That's right.
This man is no Servant.

 
**Semiramis:**
And yet, he is also Vlad III.

 

 
**Mordred:**
How the hell's that work?

 
**Sieg:**
...I explained this to Fujimaru once before.

 
**Sieg:**
He was the Master who desired the Greater Grail more than anyone, save for myself and a certain priest.

 
**Sieg:**
He was the leader of the Black team,
and the head of the Yggdmillennia family.

 
**Sieg:**
And he was the mage who hid the Greater Grail and studied it himself for sixty years.

 
**Sieg:**
He desired the Greater Grail so much that he betrayed the Lancer of Black, Vlad III...his own Servant.

 
**Sieg:**
He is Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.

 
**Darnic:**
...
...Haha, hahaha, hahaha!

 
**Darnic:**
So, with the exception of the Extra class,
every Heroic Spirit from the war is assembled here!

 
**Darnic:**
Along with the homunculus who stole the Greater Grail from me! From mankind itself!

 
**Darnic:**
Khh... Ahh, the pain.
I can feel my psyche slipping away.

 
**Darnic:**
But that doesn't matter anymore,
as the reproduction is perfect.

 
**Sieg:**
...So you still desire the Greater Grail,
even though your soul is practically falling apart?

 
**Darnic:**
A tool, a THING like you could never understand.

 
**Darnic:**
No, none of you heroes could ever understand.
You've always had power to fall back on.

 
**Darnic:**
Not me. I worked myself to the bone. I racked my brain studying magecraft so intensely it nearly killed me!

 
**Darnic:**
I extended my life even as I lived in fear. I threw myself into a Holy Grail War! I commanded armies! Betrayed my allies!

 
**Darnic:**
I'm not like the three families who let their own indolence guide them until they lost sight of the goal!

 
**Darnic:**
I'M the one who wanted this Greater Grail more than anyone! I'M the one who desired it most!

 
**Sieg:**
...Whether or not that is true,
Darnic has been dead for a long time now.

 
**Sieg:**
The thing speaking now is nothing more than the lingering desires left behind after his death.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
The desire...left behind...

 
**Sieg:**
Yes.

 
**Sieg:**
...As I said earlier, he betrayed Vlad III,
right before he died.

 
**Sieg:**
He used a Command Spell to force Vlad III to transform into a vampire and then merged with him.

 
**Sieg:**
the result was a horrid monster, neither human nor vampire.

 
**Sieg:**
But even that did not gain him the Greater Grail. A priest who was a Master for the Red team defeated him, you see.

 
**Sieg:**
That should have been the end of it.

 
**Sieg:**
When a Servant dies, they dissolve into purified magical energy, and are absorbed by the Greater Grail.

 
**Semiramis:**
...But that did not happen with him.

 
**Semiramis:**
Most likely because he was still...human.

 
**Sieg:**
Yes, that's part of it...

 
**Sieg:**
...but it's also because Darnic consumed the souls of infants to extend his life.

 
**Sieg:**
Now, he is neither human, nor Servant.

 
**Sieg:**
He is just a...thing. One driven solely by the desire to win the Holy Grail for itself.

 
**Sieg:**
That is all this “Darnic” is.

 
**Fran:**
Uh...

 
**Mordred:**
Damn... Sounds more like putting down a rabid dog than kicking ass!

 
**Sieg:**
The Greater Grail is close to falling apart. You won't even be able to activate the Third Magic, let alone reach the Root.

 
**Sieg:**
...Give it up.
Your dream ended long ago.

 
**Darnic:**
Oh no it didn't! Not yet!

 
**Darnic:**
Have you forgotten what I told you earlier?

 
**Darnic:**
I now control eighty-seven percent of the Greater Grail's system.

 
**Darnic:**
I will make far better use of it than you ever would!

 
**Darnic:**
All you've ever done with its power is sit around waiting for someone who will never come!

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Avicebron:**
What an odd thing to say. How can you make use of the Greater Grail's power when you're dead...?

 
**Darnic:**
Dead, alive, it doesn't matter.
I will always seek to control the Greater Grail!

 
**Darnic:**
Once I have it, my wish will finally be granted...!

 
**Chiron:**
...I see.
So now you are little more than a vengeful spirit.

 
**Darnic:**
But this would benefit all of you very much as well.

 
**Darnic:**
As long as I control the Greater Grail,
none of you will ever die again.

 
**Darnic:**
You would have a second&ndash;no,
a third lease on life!

 
**Darnic:**
But, if I am defeated, and this Great Holy Grail War comes to an end...

 
**Darnic:**
...all of you will disappear as well.

 
**Darnic:**
...Now, Custodian, which is the better choice?
In fact, let me make it simpler.

 
**Darnic:**
Would you rather have a third chance at life,
or just vanish with no one to remember you!

 
**Darnic:**
I swear to you all now,
on my honor as a Yggdmillennia...

 
**Darnic:**
...I will ensure that you all leave this Greater Grail, and are incarnated in the real world!

 
**Darnic:**
You will be free to do as you wish. You may make your own dreams come true, or simply wander as you please.

 
**Darnic:**
I have no intention of commanding you as my Servants.
Whatever you decide will be your business, not mine.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What're you gonna do...!?

 
**Sieg:**
I...I have no right to compel them one way or the other.
I am the Custodian. Nothing more.

 
**Sieg:**
Even if they are just reproductions, they're still conscious beings with their own unique personalities.

 
**Sieg:**
...I can't order them to their deaths.

 
**Achilles:**
...Man, Sieg, you're way beyond being a downer, you know that? You can be completely exhausting sometimes.

 
**Sieg:**
Huh?

 
**Achilles:**
Hey, Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.

 
**Achilles:**
Hate to break it to you,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

 
**Darnic:**
Oh? And why is that?

 
**Achilles:**
Easy. 'Cause I wouldn't really be a hero if I went along with you now, would I?

 
**Achilles:**
We're meant to live life to the fullest. Even if you trip up along the way, that doesn't invalidate what happened before the fall, or after.

 
**Achilles:**
And reproduction or not, Servant or not,
as long as I'm still me...

 
**Achilles:**
...I'm not doing anything that a real hero wouldn't do.

 
**Mordred:**
...
...Tch.

 
**Mordred:**
For once, you carrot-looking weirdo,
we're on the same page!

 
**Achilles:**
Carrot-looking weirdo!?

 
**Mordred:**
I can't really say I got the cleanest hands around here...but that sure as hell doesn't mean I'll be siding with you!

 
**Mordred:**
Even I'd feel pretty gross going along with your plan.

 
**Mordred:**
How 'bout you, empress lady?
You gonna side with this ass?

 
**Semiramis:**
Don't be a fool.

 
**Semiramis:**
The most generous offer I make to those who challenge me is a swift death.

 
**Siegfried:**
...Indeed.
I cannot consent to your proposal.

 
**Siegfried:**
I share Achilles's view.
I will not dishonor the life I led before.

 
**Siegfried:**
And I am certain Karna agrees with me.

 
**Karna:**
You can certainly try to prolong your own life if you wish, but I'm afraid I have no interest in that myself.

 
**Karna:**
I went to my death knowing I had done what I had to. Now, my only obligation is to lend my strength to those with goals to achieve.

 
**Avicebron:**
Likewise.

 
**Avicebron:**
I can only carry out my work when I have been summoned properly. I therefore cannot go along with your plan.

 
**Atalante:**
As for me, I refuse simply because you presume to order me about.

 
**Atalante:**
If you take issue with that,
then defeat me and prove you are right.

 
**Astolfo:**
Oh I am toootally siding with these nice people!
Yeppers!

 
**Astolfo:**
Weeell...maybe I should side with you since I was on the Black team and all...

 
**Astolfo:**
...but, naaah, can't do it!
The hero in me has gotta stop you!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Perhaps one of my many famous lines will suit here:
“Let the end try the man.”

 
**Shakespeare:**
So I am most resolutely opposed to your plan as well!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Certainly it can make a good story when a hero turns to evil, but such hackneyed plot twists are beneath me!

 
**Fran:**
Uh.
(Shaking head)

 
**Spartacus:**
?

 
**Spartacus:**
Death to the oppressor.

 
**Jack:**
Hmm... No, we don't like it.
You're a great mage.

 
**Jack:**
We hate people like you!
Oh, but not you, Mommy!

 
**Jack:**
You're a hack of a mage!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Sorry for being bad.
 
**Jack:**
That's why we love you!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Thanks, Jack!
 
**Jack:**
You're welcome!

 

 
**Chiron:**
...There you have it, Sir Darnic.

 
**Chiron:**
We are not pawns to be used however you like.
We are alive, with our own minds and opinions.

 
**Chiron:**
Even if we are just reproductions...
No, BECAUSE we are reproductions...

 
**Chiron:**
...we cannot abandon our pride as heroes.

 
**Darnic:**
...Oh well, I thought things might turn out this way.

 
**Darnic:**
So I suppose I will just have you keep fighting until you change your minds!

 
**Darnic:**
Pseudo-Greater Grail...connected!

 
**Sieg:**
It can't be... You're going to reproduce the Greater Grail INSIDE the Greater Grail!?

 
**Semiramis:**
You're out of your mind! That's like trying to create a parallel mirror world with brute force!

 
**Darnic:**
...And I'm quite all right with that.

 
**Darnic:**
For how can one be a mage without traversing the realms of the absurd?

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Sieg:**
That wish may be wrong, but as it is your wish,
I am sure it seems right to you.

 
**Sieg:**
But...that doesn't mean I'm going to let you have it.
Because your wish DIDN'T come true.

 
**Sieg:**
As the Greater Grail's Custodian,
I WILL defeat you!

 
## Section 8: Yggdmillennia
 
**Mordred:**
The hell's going on here!?
They just keep coming no matter how many we kill!

 
**Mordred:**
And what the hell is this? He's weirdly hard to fight!
It's like one minute it's a Saber, then an Archer...

 
**Chiron:**
It is most likely all of them!

 
**Chiron:**
He's using data from all seven of our classes to give himself an advantage against us!

 
**Mordred:**
What!? Isn't that cheating or something?

 
**Chiron:**
It is one of the fundaments of combat!

 
**Chiron:**
In battle, you strike at your opponent's weaknesses,
and make the battle as difficult for them as possible.

 
**Chiron:**
...But, with that in mind...

 
**Chiron:**
...there is no reason we can't do the same.

 
**Chiron:**
Sir Sieg, Master, please keep the orders coming!

 
**Chiron:**
The Greater Grail is basing its pseudo-combatants on our battle data.

 
**Chiron:**
It must be choosing classes and tactics depending on the current situation.

 
**Chiron:**
Fair enough. Then let's do this:

 
**Chiron:**
Have all thirteen of us and Sir Sieg work together.

 
**Chiron:**
If Darnic's residual thoughts refuse to shut down of their own accord, we will just have to overwhelm them with combat data until they collapse in on themselves!

 
**Karna:**
Sounds fine to me.
Our job is the same either way.

 
**Karna:**
Master of Chaldea, your orders, please.

 
**Semiramis:**
Hmm. These may not be my true gardens,
but they are still mine.

 
**Semiramis:**
I suppose it would be amusing to completely obliterate them.

 
**Shakespeare:**
If I may, Empress, have some consideration for us noncombatants! That includes Master, you'll recall!

 
**Semiramis:**
No.

 
**Avicebron:**
I think you may have gotten on her bad side.

 
**Avicebron:**
...But, no matter. If that is our plan,
I'll go ahead and use the walls to make more golems.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Just be sure to leave the floor alone, please!

 
**Mordred:**
...?
...???

 
**Fran:**
Uh, uh.

 
**Mordred:**
...Okay, she says we just gotta pound his face in!

 
**Atalante:**
Did you really just take instructions from a Berserker?

 
**Mordred:**
Shut up, you freakin' exhibitionist!

 
**Atalante:**
Wha...!

 
**H：Atalante:**
How dare you call me an exhibitionist!?

 
**Achilles:**
(Hmm... She still went back to her old outfit, though.)

 
**Siegfried:**
The lines between good and evil are ill-defined in this.
We are not fighting as proper Servants, either.

 
**Siegfried:**
...But then again, there has never been such a thing as a perfect person.

 
**Siegfried:**
Instead of lamenting that which we lack, let us fight here and now for that which we already possess!

 
**Sieg:**
...Now I get it.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Get what?

 
**Sieg:**
Well, I was so caught up in my own responsibility to fix this predicament...

 
**Sieg:**
...that I forgot they have their own responsibilities as heroes.

 
**Sieg:**
Even if they are just copies, they still have pride.
Without that, a Servant is no more than a shadow.

 
**Sieg:**
Fujimaru, we need your orders now more than ever.

 
**Sieg:**
This is the final battle, the last chance we'll likely ever have to fight by each other's sides.

 
**Sieg:**
It'll be sad to go our separate ways,
but it's time to wake from this dream.

 
## Section 9: "Returning to Tranquil Slumber"
 
**Darnic:**
No... Not yet... I can still fight...
I haven't given up yet... This isn't over...!

 
**B：???:**
Yes, it is.
Dreams end, people die, and heroes rest in peace.

 
**Darnic:**
Wha...!

 
**B：???:**
Kazikli Bey.

 
**Darnic:**
You... You were copied too!?
No... It can't be...!

 
**Darnic:**
I sealed you away!
I made sure you could never be copied!

 
**Darnic:**
You should have been no more than a puppet based on battle data!

 
**Darnic:**
How could you possibly manifest as a Servant capable of thinking for himself...?

 
**Darnic:**
It should have been impossible, Lancer!

 
**Vlad III:**
After tens of thousands of battles,
this was inevitable.

 
**Vlad III:**
Well done, all of you.
Your valiant efforts succeeded in summoning me...

 
**Vlad III:**
...a Servant capable of defeating Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.

 
**Darnic:**
Laaannnceeerrr...!

 
**Vlad III:**
My anger is long gone;
my modest ambitions are long since quashed.

 
**Vlad III:**
Is that not true for you as well?
The time has come to accept your fate.

 
**Vlad III:**
Indeed, you MUST accept it.
Otherwise, you will never move forward.

 
**Vlad III:**
Your thoughts and dreams can go no further.

 
**Vlad III:**
Darnic, my Master, and my sworn enemy.

 
**Darnic:**
What...?
You...you have your memories...!?

 
**Vlad III:**
Indeed. Of all fourteen Servants, I am the only one who retains memories of the Great Holy Grail War.

 
**Vlad III:**
Perhaps that is thanks to your absorbing me.
It is not, however, why I wish to defeat you.

 
**Vlad III:**
No, my wish to defeat you stems from neither a desire for revenge, nor anger, but my duty as a hero...

 
**Vlad III:**
...and the mercy I feel for you as your Servant.

 
**Darnic:**
Mercy...?
Don't give me that nonsense, Lancer!

 
**Darnic:**
You expect me to believe you no longer bear a grudge!?

 
**Darnic:**
I trampled your pride as a hero into dust!
You MUST despise me for that!

 
**Vlad III:**
...Then let me ask you this.

 
**Vlad III:**
If I strike you down now,
will you die despising me?

 
**Darnic:**
...What...?

 
**Vlad III:**
Do you truly not understand, Darnic?
You would hold no grudge.

 
**Vlad III:**
You may be angry, but that anger would not persist eternally.

 
**Vlad III:**
We both have dreams we have chosen to pursue, even as we have resigned ourselves to the fact that they will not be realized.

 
**Vlad III:**
Even though, deep down, we have given up on our dreams, we still fight to pursue them.

 
**Vlad III:**
It is an act of irreverence. We do not do so out of respect for anyone or anything else.

 
**Vlad III:**
We do so because our ambitions...our dreams...

 
**Vlad III:**
...are the one thing to which we will always be loyal.

 
**Vlad III:**
Even if others decry you as fork-tongued for your scheming, or fear me as the Impaler for the mountain of bodies I piled up...

 
**Vlad III:**
...that loyalty is the one thing we cannot change.
That is why our dreams stay with us.

 
**Vlad III:**
...I'm afraid this is likely beyond your understanding, Custodian. But perhaps, in the fullness of time...that will change.

 
**Sieg:**
...
...

 
**Vlad III:**
I understand you all too well, Darnic.

 
**Vlad III:**
I know that your hard work, your betrayals,
your plots...are nothing to be ashamed of.

 
**Vlad III:**
And that is precisely why this scheme of yours must end now.

 
**Vlad III:**
For if it does not, you will have betrayed even your own dreams.

 
**Vlad III:**
And dreams that have been compromised will never shine bright again.

 
**Darnic:**
...
...Ahh, dammit.

 
**Darnic:**
...It's no wonder I summoned you,
Lancer... Vlad III...

 
**Darnic:**
...If you find my dream beautiful...maybe...that's enough...

 
**Darnic:**
Yes... I can finally stop walking...
I'm exhausted... This is hard work for an old man...

 
**Darnic:**
I suppose, in the end...dreams that have been tainted and broken...simply can't be mended...

 
**Chiron:**
Is it...over?

 
**Vlad III:**
It is. The Great Holy Grail War has well and truly come to an end.

 
**Vlad III:**
Custodian.

 
**Sieg:**
Y-yes?

 
**Vlad III:**
I do not know you, but now that you have taken the Greater Grail, you are responsible for it.

 
**Vlad III:**
...Though I'm sure you are well aware of that.

 
**Sieg:**
Yes. I promise I'll take good care of it.

 
**Vlad III:**
Now, let me give you a word of advice.
Not as a hero, but as a human.

 
**Vlad III:**
Humans will come.
It is inevitable.

 
**Vlad III:**
And they WILL discover magic,
with or without the Greater Grail.

 
**Vlad III:**
But regardless, an excellent ending awaits you.
Take solace in that, and sleep well.

 
**Vlad III:**
Now then, I think I shall take my leave.
Farewell.

 
**Semiramis:**
Hmph. I never thought he would have the nerve to act like a king in my presence.

 
**Semiramis:**
That is why I was magnanimous enough to stay silent during his little speech. ...Besides, the gardens are about to collapse.

 
**Semiramis:**
Here, I will teleport the lot of you back to the ground.

 
**Semiramis:**
I will remain here, and spend what time I have left with my gardens.

 
**Semiramis:**
Try to stop me, and your already short life will end even more abruptly.

 
**Mordred:**
...

 
**Semiramis:**
...I heard that, you insolent fool!
Now be off with you!

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, I didn't say shit!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
...I could've sworn you said something about “stink.”

 
**Semiramis:**
Never mind that. Go on, all of you!
Back to the ground with you!

 
**Semiramis:**
Hmph. They certainly were a noisy bunch.

 
**Semiramis:**
Ahh, I can finally relax now.

 
**Semiramis:**
...The Great Holy Grail War, huh.

 
**Semiramis:**
When I was summoned here, did I have a wish of my own? One worth creating these gardens for...?

 
**Semiramis:**
And if I did...what was it?
Was...it for someone in particular...?

 
**Semiramis:**
...Heh. I suppose none of that matters now...

 
**Mordred:**
That damn stink bug woman!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
That's an awful thing to say!

**Fujimaru 2::**
I knew you were saying something like that!
 
**Mordred:**
Ah, piss off! Just seeing face of hers...she NEEDS to be insulted!

 

 
**Mordred:**
...Well, whatever.
At least all THAT'S over with!

 
**Mordred:**
Welp, see you around, Chaldean!
Oh, hey, am I there too?

 
**Mordred:**
If I am, make sure you ride my ass into the ground!

 
**Mordred:**
Bye for now!

 
**Fran:**
Uh!
(Salute)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
(Salute)
 
**Fran:**
Uhn!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
(Wave goodbye)
 
**Fran:**
Uhn♪

 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
They really came in AND left like a storm...

 
**Sieg:**
That they did.

 
**Spartacus:**
The oppressor is dead.
The mage's dream has now gone.

 
**Spartacus:**
My work here is done.

 
**Spartacus:**
Now, I must be off! There are oppressors in other lands that must be defeated!

 
**Spartacus:**
...Farewell!

 
**Atalante:**
Well, that certainly...happened.

 
**Atalante:**
Much has transpired,
but I believe I have done all I could.

 
**Atalante:**
Young speedster.
You...

 
**Atalante:**
On second thought, you can wait.
I will go on ahead.

 
**Achilles:**
Huh? You're leaving already!?

 
**Atalante:**
Goodbyes are best kept brief,
and reunions celebrated heartily.

 
**Atalante:**
See you around.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hmm.

 
**Shakespeare:**
...Not nearly tragic enough to suit me.

 
**Sieg:**
Isn't that a good thing?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Don't be silly! A great tragedy is just the thing to spice up a happy ending!

 
**Shakespeare:**
...Still, that Darnic fellow did bow out rather beautifully, so I suppose that must satisfy me.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Even in death, he was a man so driven to make his dream come true that he went to the trouble of recreating us.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Being as I rather walked the straight and narrow in my lifetime, I cannot but feel the touch of the green-eyed monster myself...

 
**Avicebron:**
Straight and narrow, huh?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Good one, Shakespeare!
 
**Shakespeare:**
That was no joke!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
“Straight and narrow.” (Stifle laughter)
 
**Shakespeare:**
Good [♂ sir /♀ madam], I do believe you have offended me...

 

 
**Avicebron:**
...At any rate, this is goodbye.

 
**Avicebron:**
Hmm. Master of Chaldea,
I don't know about the Custodian...

 
**Avicebron:**
...but I have a feeling you and I will meet again someday.
In fact, perhaps we already have.

 
**Avicebron:**
...Hm. What an odd thing for me to say...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Very well then, everyone!
I bid you all farewell!

 
**Shakespeare:**
...
...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Since brevity is the soul of wit, and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I shall be brief!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I believe that will suffice to fill my quota for quotations! Farewell!

 
**Avicebron:**
Good grief...

 
**Karna:**
All right, I'd better be on my way too.
I have nothing else to say.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Because we're such good friends now?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Because saying goodbye would just make you sad?

 
**Karna:**
...Am I that easy to read...?

 
**Jack:**
Ohhh... This means we have to say goodbye,
doesn't it, Mommy?

 
**Sieg:**
I'm sorry...
I'm sure you'll miss [♂ him /♀ her].

 
**Jack:**
No we won't.

 
**Jack:**
We already have a connection with Mommy.

 
**Jack:**
Even if WE aren't in Chaldea...we're sure Mommy will keep our connection alive with the other us.

 
**Jack:**
So it will be fine. Right, Mr. Custodian?

 
**Sieg:**
...I see.

 
**Sieg:**
...Thank you, Jack. You were a big help.

 
**Jack:**
Oh! You're welcome!
We will let you off the hook for killing us, then!

 
**Sieg:**
!

 
**Jack:**
Just kidding.

 
**Jack:**
We don't know what happened back then,
and we don't remember it either.

 
**Jack:**
So we have nothing to forgive or not forgive you for.

 
**Jack:**
Ever since we were born, we just like to play!

 
**Jack:**
Well, bye-bye, Mr. Custodian!
Maybe we'll see you again sometime?

 
**Sieg:**
An endlessly wandering Assassin,
all because they don't remember her, huh...

 
**Astolfo:**
Hey! Hey! Custodian!

 
**Sieg:**
...Y-yes?

 
**Astolfo:**
Were you avoiding me?

 
**Sieg:**
No, of course&ndash;okay, maybe I was.

 
**Astolfo:**
I thought so.
But not 'cause you don't like me, right?

 
**Sieg:**
Why would I dislike you?

 
**Astolfo:**
HEY! N-no answering questions with questions!

 
**Astolfo:**
Now I get it. You were just shy!

 
**Sieg:**
...Yes, I suppose I was.

 
**Sieg:**
It's sort of awkward to meet someone again after you've already said goodbye, even if they don't remember having done so.

 
**Astolfo:**
...Gotcha.

 
**Astolfo:**
But hey! The me you knew was still meee, right?

 
**Sieg:**
Of course.

 
**Sieg:**
You helped me out so many times.
I was proud to have you as my Servant.

 
**Astolfo:**
...Thanks.

 
**Astolfo:**
Well, see you again sometime!

 
**Siegfried:**
All right, I suppose I'd better be on my way as well.

 
**Siegfried:**
Sir Custodian...had you been the evil dragon I faced, perhaps we could have resolved our differences peacefully.

 
**Siegfried:**
That way, I would never have had to bathe in the blood of a dragon.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
But&ndash;

 
**Siegfried:**
I know.

 
**Siegfried:**
If I hadn't been immortal, I might have died in a ditch somewhere, without anyone ever knowing my name.

 
**Sieg:**
No, I don't think so...

 
**Sieg:**
Even if you never bathed in dragon's blood,
or came into possession of Balmung...

 
**Sieg:**
...I'm certain you would still have been a hero.

 
**Siegfried:**
...Thank you, Custodian.

 
**Siegfried:**
Thank you for thinking so well of me,
and for fighting alongside me.

 
**Achilles:**
Welp, guess we'd better hit the road too, Teacher.

 
**Chiron:**
Indeed. For a while, I was rather uncertain how this would all turn out...

 
**Chiron:**
...but it ended up being much more fun than I anticipated.

 
**Chiron:**
This battle lasted but a few days, and is unlikely to become part of history in any real sense.

 
**Chiron:**
So I hope that, if nothing else, it will remain in your memories, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Of course. I'll never forget it.

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
It will. And I'll remember all of you, too. I promise.

 
**Chiron:**
We have a connection now.

 
**Chiron:**
Once I have been summoned, I will spend every free moment I have holding classes on&ndash;

 
**Chiron:**
Hm? You already have a great many teachers?

 
**Chiron:**
Hmm, interesting. In that case, I would love to pit our different teaching styles against one another!

 
**Achilles:**
...So, we really won this, huh?

 
**Achilles:**
Back when I was alive, even though my life was one battle after another...or maybe even because of it...

 
**Achilles:**
...I couldn't ever really relax after winning,
'cause I knew the next battle was never far off.

 
**Achilles:**
But now...I guess I don't have to worry about that anymore.

 
**Achilles:**
...That's actually kinda nice, in its own way.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It is?

 
**Achilles:**
Yeah. I'm...satisfied.

 
**Achilles:**
I don't have any grudges, and no civilians around means there were no massacres or other atrocities.

 
**Achilles:**
Oh, and it's nice that Hektor's not here either.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So you really do hate him?
 
**Achilles:**
Nah, not...exactly.

 
**Achilles:**
If you ever end up summoning me,
I'll figure out a way to get along with him.

 
**Achilles:**
...Yeah, it'll work out.
Just gotta think positive.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
I take it you don't get along?
 
**Achilles:**
Hmm... Well, let's just say we went through a lot together, and most of it was less than friendly.

 
**Achilles:**
That said, I'm a Servant now. I'm sure if I got summoned,
I'd forget any problems I had with him.

 

 
**Achilles:**
...But that's not what I'm really trying to say.

 
**Achilles:**
What I really want to say is that I bet I could have a lot of fun fighting alongside you guys again.

 
**Achilles:**
So if you ever find yourself in a tight spot in Greece, just gimme a call.

 
**Achilles:**
I'll come running, no matter when or where you are.
Promise.

 
**Achilles:**
Thanks for everything.
...This was a really good battle.

 
**Sieg:**
Now that the Greater Grail is stable again,
this world is about to disappear.

 
**Sieg:**
Give me your hand.
It's time we returned to the real world.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Here we are. Now, at last...I can wait here, secure in the knowledge that the Greater Grail will be safe.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
You know, I really have to ask...

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Who are you waiting for, anyway?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
It's a secret.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Gotcha.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I know I shouldn't be keeping anything from you, but...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's fine. I get it.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Are you sure?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Some things aren't for anyone else to know. Not even friends.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...
...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Yes, but in exchange, I want you to be my friend.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Me... Your friend?

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...I see.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
All this time, I thought that you and I...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...were more like an oppressor and his victim than anything else.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
What!? No! Not even close!

 
**Evil Dragon:**
So, you would call me your friend?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Thank you. I will always cherish this memory.
But, there's something else I need to say.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
There is nothing I can do for you,
nothing I can give you after all you did for me.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
All I could do was stand around...even with all those heroes willing to risk their lives helping.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I can't tell you how sorry I am about that.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
It's fine. Really.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
...That only makes me feel worse.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Don't worry. This was fun.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Fun, huh?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
You're a very positive person,
aren't you, Fujimaru? I'm afraid I...

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Hm?
You know, now that I think of it, I had fun too.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Even though I genuinely feared for my life back when we were fighting... Strange.

 

 
**Evil Dragon:**
...Anyway, I'm sure you still have a long, difficult road ahead.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
It may not be much&ndash;hell, it may not even be welcome&ndash;but, I'd like to help you on it, if I can.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
So...since I am the Greater Grail's Custodian,
I'm going to repurpose the terminal I made earlier.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So, does that mean...?

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
Sieg?

 
**Sieg:**
I can still function as a terminal, but since my connection to my true body will be cut off...

 
**Sieg:**
...I'll only be able to use my dragon power for a fraction of an instant.

 
**Sieg:**
...But, if that's okay with you...I'd still like to do whatever I can to help you out.

 
**Sieg:**
It's the least I can do for someone who considers me a friend.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
There. Now I really can rest easy.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
So you're going to stay here until this person shows up?

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Yes. I don't mind waiting.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Not even if it takes them a hundred,
or a thousand, or ten thousand years.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
You see, I know for certain that they will get here eventually.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I have all the faith in the world in them.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Farewell...my friend. And thank you.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
We may not have spent much time together, but I'll cherish it forever. It will always be a precious memory to me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1::**
Goodbye, Sieg.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
Goodbye, Fujimaru.
Take care.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
I hope my terminal will be of at least some use to you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2::**
...Take care of yourself.
 
**Evil Dragon:**
You too, Fujimaru.

 
**Evil Dragon:**
Goodbye, my friend.
My new Master.

 

 
**Narration::**
I'm not worried about all this waiting.
If anything, my conviction is now certainty.

 
**Narration::**
...It was a fleeting encounter,
and a fleeting farewell.

 
**Narration::**
But it doesn't bother me.

 
**Narration::**
The sorrow of parting may make my heart ache,
but even that is drowned out by a great swell of joy.

 
**Narration::**
Those few short days I spent with [♂ him /♀ her] gave me boundless hope for mankind.

 
**Narration::**
It was a short battle.
A small fight to the death.

 
**Narration::**
Still, I'm sure that man had no choice but to fight,
no matter how much pain it brought him.

 
**Narration::**
I can't say that was beautiful,
but I can't say it was ugly, either.

 
**Narration::**
...I can no longer track my terminal.

 
**Narration::**
Soon, he will be summoned as a Servant,
and aid Fujimaru in [♂ his /♀ her] battles.

 
**Narration::**
From now on, he will be making his own memories.

 
**Narration::**
In time, Sieg will become a Servant totally separate from me, and forge his own path.

 
**Narration::**
I only hope he is at least some small help to Fujimaru in the struggles ahead.

 
**Narration::**
For my part, I think I'll go back to sleep.
...I wonder when I'll wake?

 
**Narration::**
Whenever it is, I don't mind.
This tiny, sealed-off world will not change any longer.

 
**Narration::**
But if something were somehow to change,
I am sure it would be for the better.

 
**Narration::**
For now, I sleep, forever and ever...waiting for the future that I know will one day come.
