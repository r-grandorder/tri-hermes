# Battle in New York 2020
 
## A New Battle
 
**Nero:**
That's right! It is that time of year once again!
I am proud to announce the fourth Nero Fest!

 
**Nero:**
Hehehe. Quite the jubilant reception, is it not,
Fujimaru? And who can blame them!

 
**Nero:**
Of course it is! This is a festival of Rome, by Rome, and for Rome! Why shouldn't I be excited!?

 
**Nero:**
I have prepared plenty of prizes once again, and would like nothing better than for everyone to test their strengths against one another in fierce competition!

 
**Nero:**
Though it hardly need be said that I will be this year's victor! Yes, this is the year where all will sing my praises as Rome's greatest swordsman!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see you're in a good mood, Your Imperial Majesty.
 
**Nero:**
Of course! The mere fact that Olympia shall open its doors again is enough to content me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't mean...infinite Guts...?
 
**Nero:**
Heh heh heh. Some things are better left unsaid.

 
**Nero:**
Nero Fest is getting a bit long in the tooth, so I thought it would be a good time to present myself in all my steamy goddesslike glory!

 
**Nero:**
Forget the Venus de Milo!
Now is the time for the Venus de Nero!

 

 
**Mash:**
Senpaaai! Emperor Nerooo!
Excuse me, please let me through!

 
**Mash:**
Phew, what a crowd. I'm a little exhausted just from making my way here.

 
**Mash:**
Still, it just goes to show what a great success Nero Fest has been, and how much everyone loves it. I think that's a wonderful thing.

 
**Nero:**
Umu, you will have to forgive me for my overwhelming success! That aside, you look even more daring than usual today, Mash!

 
**Mash:**
Thank you. Please watch me, Master.
I'm going to do my very best again this year.

 
**Mash:**
My goal is to place at least in the top ten!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Only the top ten, Mash? Shouldn't you be aiming for first? You are Chaldea's signature Servant and all.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Not to mention that this year's Nero Fest prize is exceptional. Even more so than usual!

 
**Da Vinci:**
So for my part, I was really hoping Fujimaru would be the one to take it home.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Morning, Da Vinci!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Morning! I'm glad to see you haven't forgotten your manners!

 
**Da Vinci:**
“Never forget to properly greet someone,
no matter what's going on.”

 
**Da Vinci:**
Or at least that's what we've been doing since the Incineration of Humanity.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
An exceptional prize...?
 
**Nero:**
Oh, come now, Da Vinci! Don't give the game away so early! Wait until my official announcement!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oops, right, of course. So sorry about that.
It just slipped out.

 

 
**Nero:**
Umu. It seems all the participating Servants have assembled.

 
**Nero:**
Then we shall proceed to the Colosseum.
See you later, Fujimaru and Mash.

 
**Nero:**
We will be broadcasting the opening ceremony in the cafeteria via Sheba, so feel free to bask in its glory from here.

 
**Caligula:**
Yeeeaaahhh!
Neroooooo!

 
**Nero:**
Uncle!? It is too soon for you to be cheering for me yet!
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please wait until the ceremony...

 
**Caligula:**
...

 
**Caligula:**
 
Yeeeaaahhh!
Empty treasury Neroooooo!

 
**Nero:**
What do you take me for, some petty tyrant who used up all her nation's money!? I will admit I came close to that once, but I never went so far as to&ndash;

 
**Nero:**
...Wait. Were you speaking of Rome's current treasury, Uncle!?

 
**Caligula:**
...Heh.
(Smirking in agreement)

 
**Nero:**
That cannot be right! All the money I have been saving over this past year was in that treasury!

 
**Nero:**
Along with the Holy Grail I had purchased from Da Vinci to present as this Nero Fest's grand prize!

 
**Mash:**
A Holy Grail!?
Your “exceptional prize” is a Holy Grail!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yup. Every now and then, a Singularity comes along that ends up disappearing on its own.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And when it does, it sometimes leaves a Holy Grail behind. They may not be the best-quality Grails, but they're still pure, crystallized magical energy.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So when one of those low-quality Grails falls into our lap, it's my job to retrieve it, polish it, and make it into something usable.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Emperor Nero happened to find me fixing up the latest such Grail, and I agreed to let her have it at a fair price as long as she made it her grand prize☆

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You really are a genius...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fair price? Do I even want to know how much QP you charged?
 

 
**Nero:**
This will never do! We cannot have Nero Fest without a suitable prize! Uncle, who is the villain responsible for&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Wait! Sheba just turned on!
It's about to show us something...!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hahahahaha! Greetings to you at this late hour of 3:00 a.m., my fellow Heroic Spirits!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oh, wait, it's morning there, isn't it?
Hahahaha, forgive me. Just a little KoH humor.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I have lost all sense of the various time zones here, as there is neither day or night in this city!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Truly, this is a glittering cityscape even at night, worthy even of me! Perhaps that tells you where I may be speaking of?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now then...I must first convey my apologies to the Saber in red regalia.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fifth Emperor of Rome, all of the money you worked so hard to save...now belongs to me.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Caesar knows why. You should ask him.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Though of course, he is most likely long gone by now. Indeed, there are few things more frightening than being related to an unrepentant grifter.

 
**Caesar:**
“Yes, I admit that I am deep in debt, a not inconsiderable portion of which I owe to you.”

 
**Caesar:**
“But here is how I see it: I am the embodiment of Rome; therefore, my debt is Rome's debt.”

 
**Caesar:**
“Accordingly, those affiliated with Rome are my family, and must stand in joint surety with me.”

 
**Caesar:**
“And as it happens, there is a magnificent vault right here filled with riches. Riches enough to repay my debt in full.”

 
**Nero:**
Juuullliiiuuusss!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Heh. And so the contents of your vault are now mine. Unfortunate, but that is how it is.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
However! While I may pity you, I cannot commend you!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
A sporting spectacle for Servants to pit their skills against one another? A fourth Nero Fest? You fool!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What were you thinking, using the same arena all four times!? And a decrepit relic as the Colosseum at that!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
If I were running this festival, I would ensure my contestants compete in the greatest arena in the world.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
For example...the pinnacle of entertainment,
right here in Manhattan!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
The Garden!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's in New York!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And here I thought he was all about the good old days...
 

**Nero:**
What!?
An all-weather stadium!?!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hahaha, did you think I spent my time in that tropical resort merely idling the hours away? Of course not!
I have been planning this ever since that trip began!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Furthermore, I declare here and now, that it is THIS festival which will determine the strongest Servant!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And so I have come to New York! The only place in the world suitable enough to act as the stage for this historic event.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
To all you Heroic Spirits watching this now, listen well!
I have opened a gate in Chaldea that will take you here!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Those among you who fancy yourselves the strongest of all Servants, come to New York and prove it.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Needless to say, this event will also consist of team battles. I await you here, atop this skyscraper!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Once you have defeated all the other challengers...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...that is when I, the Golden Archer, the oldest King of Heroes in all humanity, shall pass my final judgment!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Furthermore, my full-time secretary, Moolah, has prepared a host of incredible prizes for you to win!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fight hard, play hard, and challenge me for supremacy! Now is the time to prove that you are the strongest!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hehehe... Hahaha...
Haaahahaha!

 
**Mash:**
I can't believe it...
Gilgamesh took over Nero Fest!

 
**Mash:**
And, um... I'm sorry, Emperor Nero...
I... I don't know what to say...

 
**Nero:**
What to say... What to say...
What... What...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...(I have no idea what to say to her.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nero...?
 

 
**Nero:**
What...an incredible idea!
You are right, accursed King of Heroes!

 
**Nero:**
I have been clinging to my Colosseum like a fool! If there is a better stage to be found in the modern era, then that is what I shall use.

 
**Nero:**
Flashy lights! Gleaming skyscrapers! Classy champagne flowing from bottle to glass in the very poshest of penthouses!

 
**Nero:**
Umu! Enemy though he may be, I must commend him on his decadence, his ostentatiousness, and his sheer wealth! That is what entertainment should be!

 
**Nero:**
I will gladly accept his challenge!
Hear me, all you Heroic Spirits gathered around!

 
**Nero:**
Nero Fest may be no more,
but our festival itself remains unchanged!

 
**Nero:**
This event shall henceforth be called...
Battle in New York 2020!

 
**Nero:**
That arrogant King of Heroes clearly believes that HE is the strongest one of all! Let us show him how wrong he is!

 
**Nero:**
We shall pummel him with the full force of our greatest Noble Phantasms and send him tumbling off his high perch!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now that's the emperor we know!
 

 
**Nero:**
Umu! Just leave it all to me! To be frank,
I am looking forward to visiting New York myself!

 
**Nero:**
Hehe. Fujimaru, Mash.
This is where our competition truly begins.

 
**Nero:**
Only one team will be able to challenge the King of Heroes. I cannot wait to see who emerges victorious!

 
## Before the Awards Ceremony
 
**Mash:**
So this is where the finals will be held...
Huh? Emperor Nero?

 
**Nero:**
Mash and Fujimaru!?
What is going on here?

 
**Nero:**
Is this not the site of the final battle?
Has there been some kind of mistake!?

 
**B：???:**
It is no mistake. I determined from the start that there would be two teams advancing to the finals.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That sounded like...Gilgamesh!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That sounded like...Gorgeous P!
 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king. You will have a chance to bask in the honor as you fall to the ground.

 
**Nero:**
So you mean to take us all on at once? If that is what your pride as a king demands, I have no objections.

 
**Nero:**
But first... I know that my reserves alone could not possibly have sufficed to pay for this extravaganza.

 
**Nero:**
So tell me, just how much did you spend to put on this event?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Heh. I would estimate it cost about three times what you had in Rome's treasury...but that isn't to say I had to spend much myself.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
One came up with a business deal to restore your treasury's funds. It succeeded brilliantly, so you now lay claim to several times what you did before.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It is no wonder he is known as one of the Nine Worthies. His powers of elocution are no less effective in modern show business than they were in his own time.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
He must have been thinking harder about how to help Nero Fest succeed than you were.

 
**Mash:**
Caesar... He certainly has his share of issues, but I guess he really was worried about you, in his own way.

 
**Nero:**
Umu! That is all I needed to know.
Now we can focus entirely on our battle, King of Heroes!

 
**Nero:**
This festival may belong to you now,
but I still have my own pride as an emperor!

 
**Nero:**
Besides, it is not the proprietor that is the star of the show, but the brave heroes who take part in it! Now, as the undisputed strongest of them all, I shall reclaim the Holy Grail that is rightfully mine!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Foolish emperor. That is exactly why I will be fighting you in this form. The King of Heroes has been the star of this show from the beginning, and the star I will remain to the end.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Unfortunately for you, I have grown tired of counting my money and playing the kind, understanding king.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
No, what I have in store for you is nothing less than hell itself! Your half-baked heroism will not be enough to defeat me!

 
**Gorgeous P:**
Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!

 
**Gorgeous P:**
As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king. You will have a chance to bask in the honor as you fall to the ground.

 
**Nero:**

**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilgamesh:**
What!? This cannot be right!
When did I find my back against a wall!?

 
**Gorgeous P:**
What!? This cannot be right!
When did I find my back against a wall!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Curse you, curse you, curse you!!!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
They manage one good hit, and suddenly I'm the one who's wounded and plummeting to the ground!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Tch, it would seem this is the end for this manifestation! Once I hit the ground, that will be it for me!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But don't let this go to your head, mongrels! Remember, I am the kindest of all my various permutations!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Next time, I shall return as an even more refined King of Heroes! Enjoy the championship belt while it is still yours!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...yooours!
...yooours!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...yooours!

 
**Gorgeous P:**
Curse you, curse you, curse you!!!

 
**Gorgeous P:**
They manage one good hit, and suddenly I'm the one who's wounded and plummeting to the ground!

 
**Gorgeous P:**
Tch, it would seem this is the end for this manifestation! Once I hit the ground, that will be it for me!

**Gorgeous P:**
...yooours!
...yooours!

 
**Gorgeous P:**
...yooours!

**Fujimaru 1:**
We... We...
 

 
**Mash:**
We did it, Master! I've confirmed that the...um...New York King of Heroes has returned to Chaldea!

 
**Nero:**
Indeed he has! Victory is ours,
Fujimaru and Mash!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Congratulations, Nero!
 
**Nero:**
Umu. Umu, umu! Do not stop now!
Keep lavishing me with praise!

 
**Nero:**
Thank you for your support during battle,
and for leading us to victory!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You did great, Mash!
 
**Mash:**
Thank you, Master, but I didn't really do anything compared to you, and not just in this battle!

 
**Mash:**
I could never have made it this far without your orders and support.

 
**Mash:**
The King of Heroes was right! This was a team victory. And as our team's leader, you deserve the lion's share of the credit.

 

 
**Nero:**
Oh... Look, Fujimaru.
That is the Holy Grail I prepared for this event.

 
**Nero:**
That accursed King of Heroes must have fitted it to his championship belt. But it should still work fine!

 
**Nero:**
Take it for yourself, Fujimaru.
I have no need of it.

 
**Nero:**
I am the one who secured it in the first place, after all, and it would be completely improper for an event's proprietor to go home with its grand prize.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In that case, don't mind if I do.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then I'll just use it on you.
 
**Nero:**
U-umu, I see.
How can I refuse such a kind offer...

 
**Nero:**
(Perhaps it is due to my mother and that poison affair...but Holy Grails make me nervous...)

 

 
**Mash:**
I've retrieved the Holy Grail.

 
**Mash:**
I wish we could stay and enjoy the nighttime view a little longer, but Da Vinci just asked us to head back to the arena immediately.

 
**Nero:**
Umu, the victors have been determined! All that remains now is for them to stand atop the podium!

 
**Nero:**
I am proud to call you my heroes, brave warriors!
Now, let us be off!

 
**Nero:**
I declare that the Battle in New York 2020 has officially come to a triumphant end!
