# Battle in New York 2021

## Opening Ceremony
 
**Announcer:**
Greetings, Heroic Spirit fans the world over, and welcome to the event you've all been waiting for!

 
**Announcer:**
No one remains on top forever. What we think of as strength changes with the times.

 
**Announcer:**
Countless Heroic Spirits claim to be the strongest of all, but which of them would actually win in a fight?

 
**Announcer:**
Well, you won't have to wait much longer to find out! Prepare to feast your eyes on the strongest Heroic Spirits this planet has to offer!

 
**Announcer:**
That's right! It's time for the martial arts tournament that comes but once a year! A festival of cheers and applause where prizes and QP come fast and furious!

 
**Announcer:**
Only two hours remain until the start of Battle in New York 2021!

 
**???:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow, everyone's back this year!
 

 
**Mash:**
I know! At this point, this festival has practically become a Chaldean autumn staple!

 
**Mash:**
It all started when Emperor Nero began holding regular martial arts tournaments themed around ancient Rome's Olympia.

 
**Mash:**
Then last year, it moved to New York and became a bigger, more modern event thanks to the King of Heroes.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu, right you are, Mash! You have done an excellent job as the master of ceremonies!

 
**Nero Bride:**
I only wish your spot-on recap did not so painfully remind me that my Nero Fest is now a thing of the past...

 
**Nero Bride:**
...This was all originally my idea.
How did it come to this?

 
**Nero Bride:**
I always did the best I could with the scant resources I had to ensure everyone would enjoy themselves, but I suppose it just wasn't enough...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It might have a different name now, but it'll always be Nero Fest at heart!
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Umu, you are correct! I am still very much this event's honorary chairwoman!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Besides, I started this event so that everyone could have fun. It would defeat the purpose if my gloom were to cast a pall over the proceedings now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Come on. Let's go take that smarmy tyrant down a peg or three.
 
**Nero Bride:**
You refer to that man who is always dressed in gaudy gold armor, yes? Umu! Who does he think he is, getting another animation update!?

 
**Nero Bride:**
He may have managed to slip away last year, but this year, I will show him the consequences of his own actions!

 

 
**Nero Bride:**
At any rate, my first order of business is to make my way through the prelims. The rules are the same as last year.

 
**Nero Bride:**
The Servant who wins the tournament will be given the right to challenge the self-proclaimed champion of all Heroic Spirits, the King of Heroes.

 
**Nero Bride:**
But before that, I will need to face and defeat my many rivals over there.

 
**Nero Bride:**
In this, the fifth Olympia, it is once again time to determine the strongest Servant. I look forward to seeing what sort of tricks my opponents will employ this year.

 
**Mash:**
Oh yes. It seems that everyone has been training hard for this event, so I expect there will be battles like we've never seen before.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're very optimistic about things like this, aren't you, Mash?
 
**Mash:**
Oh, well... It's just that, in all the past tournaments, I've always learned something new and interesting by watching everyone else fight.

 
**Mash:**
In a way, I guess it's a lot like watching sports...
So yes, I do enjoy it a lot.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll have to keep an eye out for Master skills better than what I've got...
 
**Mash:**
Good idea. It makes me wish we could have Da Vinci make you a tournament-specific Mystic Code.

 
**Mash:**
And just imagine the possibilities if you could customize your Mystic Codes with the Master skills you want.

 

 
**Nero Bride:**
I see you are both excited for the upcoming battles as well. I would expect no less from last year's champions. That spirit shall make your inevitable defeat at my hands all the sweeter.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I will be competing against you and the King of Heroes as a lone bride this year, and I do not plan on losing to either of you.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fuhahahaha! Tell me, do you ordinary Servants have enough Embers in stock?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Ah yes, nothing like a little light KoH humor to start the day! And on that note: good morning, New York!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It has now been a year since my shocking fall from the top floor of that skyscraper, but the early King of Heroes gets the figurative worm. Now that my vigor has been renewed, I have awakened with the light of dawn.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now then, I trust all you miscreants at Chaldea are hearing this?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
That goes for you too, Fujimaru and the Fifth Emperor of Rome, who I wish would give that bride outfit to the King of Knights.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Though this may be the second annual Gilgamesh Cup,
let me make this abundantly clear.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It hardly need be said, but to be clear, last year's tournament was but a trial run, a warm-up, you might say.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I was obviously pulling my punches in that final bout, as demonstrated by how old my animations were at the time.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Go on, think back.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Remember how my Gate of Babylon lacked its usual sharpness, and how my hand wielding the Sword of Rupture was exhausted.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But this year, there will be no waiting and seeing, and no holding back!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
This year, I will descend from on high as the most powerful final boss to ever live, wielding violence worthy of the strongest Heroic Spirit!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fuhahaha, I would hold onto all three of your Command Spells if I were you, just so you have a hope of getting through all five of my Break Gauges!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Heh. I commend you for not letting your pride get in the way of a sound strategy, King of Heroes. I take it you will not be repeating your mistakes from last year then?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Of course not. I also thought about calling in a certain friend of mine to form a team, but decided against it, as there is no telling what trouble that could cause.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
For example, I wouldn't be at all surprised if, in the midst of battle, they decided it was more interesting to carpet bomb me from behind than to fight our intended opponent.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And so I will once again be taking on the tournament winner single-handedly. Consider it my handicap.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Sure sounds like he's letting his pride get in the way to me...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Hmm... I can't tell if he's being serious or not...)
 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
At any rate! To all you Heroic Spirits watching this now, listen well!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Those among you who fancy yourselves the strongest of all Servants, come to New York once again and prove it!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But be warned that there is no station greater than mine, as the throne where I await you sits atop the entire world!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Here, I, the Golden Archer, the newest King of Heroes in all of New York, shall pass my final judgment on your strength! I mean it this time!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oh, and once again, I have prepared an assortment of splendid prizes to be won at Madison Square Garden.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Note too that there will be a different receptionist this year, as Moolah decided not to invest due to some business with unlucky stars.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
While this new receptionist is quite adept in all things, she is still new to this line of work, so ensure that you conduct your affairs at the shop in an orderly manner.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
A tactician named Chen Gong told me, “A true champion asks three times if there are any who can best him.”

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I like that! I like that very much! So on that note, I invite you all to once again do battle in my garden, to entertain me, and to suffer defeat at my most capable hands!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hehehe... Hahaha...
Haaahahaha!

 
**Mash:**
And that was Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes. He certainly knows how to give a rousing speech, doesn't he, Senpai?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You always see the good in people, don't you, Mash?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wasn't Chen Gong all about killing the lord he served under?
 

 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu, by this point, I take that arrogance of his to be his way of welcoming the combatants.

 
**Nero Bride:**
After all, he is the sort of man who couldn't help laughing at those who challenge him, no matter how hard they fought. Even so, he would still fight them seriously.

 
**Mash:**
I agree. I think he was looking forward to this tournament more than anyone.

 
**Mash:**
He's also not the type to let bygones be bygones, so I'm sure he's been eagerly awaiting his chance to take revenge!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu! Come, Fujimaru, let us go perform on the stage he has set for us!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Together, we shall ascend his golden skyscraper, and achieve an even more glorious victory than last year!

 
## Invader Autumn
 
**Announcer:**
Hello, all you fine people watching today! Can you hear the excitement echoing throughout the stadiuuum!?

 
**Announcer:**
There has been death battle after death battle!
Friendships surpassing friendships! But now, after many glorious matches, this tournament is about to reach its grand finale!

 
**Announcer:**
As we speak, the winners are headed to the stage of the heavens to challenge the King of Heroes himself!

 
**Announcer:**
Can the challengers escape with their lives? Or will our CEO succeed at achieving his childish revenge?

 
**Announcer:**
Stay tuned, as the final battle to determine the strongest Heroic Spirit on the planet is about to kick off!

 
**Announcer:**
Who will the goddess of victory smile upon today!?

 
**Announcer:**
Now then, on a completely different note, the current odds are at fifty-fifty! That's a clean, aboveboard,
no-illegal-tricks-whatsoever fifty-fifty!

 
**Announcer:**
There are only two minutes left to go, so grab all the money you have and place those bets while you can♡

 
**???:**
...All right then, I think it's time I made my move.

 
**Mash:**
We've arrived at the top of the skyscraper, Senpai! This stage is just as glamorous as the one from last year!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu, I must admire how the sheer gorgeousness seems to spill forth like a swimming pool filled with gold coins!
I daresay it is the perfect stage for a city of prosperity that worships money above all else!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Emperor Nero!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
When did you get here!?
 

 
**Nero Bride:**
Heh, do not be so surprised. I simply used both Imperial Privilege and Presence Concealment to steal away in a corner of the elevator.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I had a hunch that you and Mash alone might have a difficult time...

 
**Nero Bride:**
...so I decided to accompany you just in case.

 
**Mash:**
Oh! Well, thank you, Emperor Nero.
That's very considerate of you.

 
**Mash:**
But are you sure you're okay to fight? It's been less than an hour since your last battle, after all...

 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu... The truth is that I am indeed a bit exhausted.
I can certainly cheer you on, but I do not think I will be able to do much else.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Ahh, I was so close to winning that final battle...

 
**Nero Bride:**
...I only wish I could have put on a more impressive show...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry, you were plenty impressive.
 
**Nero Bride:**
U-umu, you think so? Then I suppose I had better stop moping!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Very well then, I will watch the gallant figures of the warriors who defeated me from the best seat in the house!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry, you made for a very dashing bride.
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu. I may have lost the battle, but I did at least prove that a bridal dress makes for an impressive challenger.

 
**Nero Bride:**
...Hm? Hold on. Something about that did not sound quite right, but I cannot put my finger on what it was.

 
**Mash:**
True, there did seem to be something slightly off about it, but somehow, I think it fits...

 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Enough idle chitchat, mongrel.
Can't you tell the cameras are rolling?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I've grown tired of drowning my boredom with wine, and the common people watching this finale are waiting my judgment with bated breath.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Do not think you will be so lucky as to defeat me twice,
you impudent little mongrel!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I shall grant you the honor of defeat at my own hands!
Go on, call forth as many Heroic Spirit pawns as you wish!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oh, but first, let me ask you this.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Have you successfully restored humanity yet,
or are you still in the midst of doing so?

 
？1,940409011：All restored and good as new.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oho. Now you have my interest! Very well then,
I will see just how far you have come myself!

 
？2,940409012：I'm still working on it.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And you still thought you could challenge me!? You are an even greater fool than I thought! As soon as this tournament is over, you are to get back to work and make serious progress! Trust me, you will enjoy it!

 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Come, mongrel! This will be the last such tournament ever to take place in New York.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Witness a battle truly elegant enough for this resplendent cityscape! A graceful, elegant, and bold battle!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Hm? Hold on. Did I truly just say that...?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilgamesh:**
What's wrong? Is that all you've got!? I can feel your attacks, but they are no more than fleabites!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Gnn, I cannot believe how proud he is! I am certain we have him cornered, yet he remains as defiant as ever!

 
**Nero Bride:**
I see now that he is the type of king whose strength comes from an adamant refusal to stop fighting until he wins! I know it all too well!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Heh. For my part, I can see why you were once known for your infinite supply of courage, Emperor. But that is now ancient history. You no longer have a part to play on this stage!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh crap!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's gonna use his Noble Phantasm on us!
 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
If you have exhausted your options, then all that remains is for me to pass judgment upon you. By my Sword of Rupture, I'll have you return that championship belt to me!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
As I knew it would, this battle has ended with my victory! There could be no other outcome!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fuhahaha! Indeed, I am certain there is no one else on this earth who can possibly defeat me! But in line with Chen Gong's advice, I will ask three times just to be certain!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Can anyone defeat me!?
Can anyone defeat me!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
One last time!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Can anyone defeat me!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrggghhh!!!

 
**Mash:**
King Gilgamesh!?

 
**Nero Bride:**
What was that!? It looked as though he was struck by a bolt of lightning!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Ghh... I knew I could be attacked from behind...but I never expected an attack from above...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But how did this assailant do it? How could they have gained the upper hand on me when I completely control this skyscraper...?

 
**Mash:**
Do you hear that?
It sounds like it's coming from the sky...

 
**D：???:**
Hehehehe... Hehehehehe...

 
**D：???:**
Ahahahaha! Good evening, my fellow Heroic Spirits!

 
**D：???:**
Oh my, what are you doing sprawled out on the ground like that, Goldie? Gosh, I hope I'm not interrupting your fun!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Huh? That voice sounds familiar...)
 

 
**Nero Bride:**
Fujimaru, look! Up there!

 
**Mash:**
...What?

 
**Nero Bride:**
What the...?

 
**???:**
Let's see, testing, testing. This thing on?
Can you all hear me in your minds? You can? Great!

 
**D：???:**
...Ahem. Listen carefully, living creatures of Earth.

 
**D：???:**
I know this is short notice, but as of this moment, I've taken over the city. All your food, clothing, and shelter now belong to me.

 
**D：???:**
I am the ruler of the Sapphire Galaxy and the goddess of Venus who came here from the Founding Stars.

 
**D：???:**
My name is...Space Ishtar!

 
**Mash:**
Space.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Ishtar.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
What was it you said earlier? Something about a battle to determine the strongest Heroic Spirit?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Did you really think I was going to take a challenge like that lying down?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I'M the strongest Heroic Spirit around, obviously.
And now, I'm going to prove it.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Go, Mini Maannas!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Changing everyone in this city into jewels will be a good warm-up for the rest of my world domination!

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm still trying to get my head around what's happening, but it looks like the enormous spaceship is sending out a swarm of tiny ships!

 
**Mash:**
Now the smaller ships are firing mysterious lasers at every part of New Yor&ndash;Oh no! Master!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Look out, Fujimaru!

 
**Mash:**
Em-Emperor Nero just transformed into a jewel and flew off towards the enormous spaceship!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Hehe. As you can see, anyone who dares to defy me soon becomes part of my collection.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I secretly scattered goddess particles around the city during the tournament, and I registered this land as my territory to my temple.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
My meme contamination is all done. Now, your languages, tastes, and sensibilities will all be(long to) me.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
All the beautiful things will be mine...and so will all the ugly things.

 
**Mash:**
Oh. Um... What does that mean, exactly?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It means she's taking anything and everything that isn't nailed down.
 

 
**Mash:**
I see. Then that's definitely the Ishtar we know!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Why...you...
Space Ishtar!!!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I don't know what you're up to this time, worthless goddess, but you've got a lot of nerve declaring yourself the strongest after such a cowardly attack.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
If you really wish to be declared the strongest, Ishtar, then get your worthless self down here and fight me fair and square!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
No way. You're still alive after a direct hit from Maanna's Divine Raytribution!? You didn't even turn into a jewel, or a sheep! Just how stubborn are you, anyway?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
But anyway, unfortunately for you, there's no way a goddess like myself would ever condescend to mingle among the common rabble, right?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I only thought I'd play with you guys because it seemed like a fun way to kill time during my tour of Earth♡

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Still... I suppose if I'm going to play with you,
I might as well give you a real chance.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
All right. Your little martial arts tournament was kind of amusing, so I'll be nice and hold another for you guys.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
And in recognition of their accomplishment, I'll give whoever wins my tournament a chance to take me on.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
If I lose, I'll leave Earth forever.
But if I win, I get to keep “Master” for myself.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
That's right, I know all about the legendary treasure called a Master and that it's somewhere on this planet. I read all about it in Ancient Space Mythology Quarterly.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I couldn't find any energy signature high enough to qualify as a legend when I scanned your planet before...

 
**Space Ishtar:**
...so if&ndash;when I win, you're going to tell me where you've hidden this Master thing and hand it over peacefully.

 
**Mash:**
Um... You want to keep Master? But&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just...pretend you don't know...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good, she's got some ridiculous idea stuck in her head again, as always.
 

 
**Mash:**
(R-right, good point. Okay, I'll do my best to avoid calling you Mas&ndash;Um, starting right now.)

 
**Mash:**
So, when you say you're going to hold another tournament, does that mean we're going to fight in your spaceship?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
No, you're going to play my game there on Earth. It would be a waste not to use what you've already got, right?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
That's why I went ahead and took over the King of Heroes' whole shebang. His stadium, his admin systems, his staff... Eeeverything.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What!? When you say “everything”...does that include my profits!?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Well of course☆ Your shop's profits, that smooth-talking sheep Dumuzid, the Holy Grail being offered as a victory prize... They're aaall mine.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Ever heard the space expression “What goes around comes around?” Well, this is what comes around, King of Heroes. Sorry not sorry☆

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I never stole anyone else's hard-earned profits! Though I may have confiscated a business plan or two...

 
**Space Ishtar:**
All right, that's all I have to say. I may be a cruel and heartless goddess, but that doesn't mean I'm going to invade your planet without giving you a fair chance.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
If you want to get New York back, all you have to do is win my tournament and earn the right to fight me.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I look forward to seeing what you've got,
Heroic Spirits of Earth.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Oh, and one last thing: make sure you have this Master thingy ready to hand over when I inevitably win, or else! Bye now!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
C...
Cu...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Curse you, Ishtaaaaaarrr!!!
How is Space Ishtar even a thing!?

 
## Age of Ishtarin
 
**Mash:**
This is terrible...

 
**Mash:**
A giant flying saucer is occupying New York City...
Its inhabitants have all been turned into valuables...

 
**Mash:**
Emperor Nero was transformed into a jewel and taken away while protecting Mas&ndash;uh, Senpai...

 
**Mash:**
And the Holy Grail the King of Heroes had prepared as a victory prize has been stolen...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's just sitting over there, pouting.
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes... He's been dead silent ever since we made our escape from New York.

 
**Mash:**
Suffice to say, it looks like Ishtar...

 
**Mash:**
Or rather, an Ishtar calling herself Space Ishtar has well and truly claimed New York for herself.

 
**Mash:**
The Servants who managed to escape suggested we band together and try to destroy her spaceship...

 
**Mash:**
...but we can't risk Emperor Nero and all the people of New York she's holding hostage.

 
**Heroine XX:**
Yeah... The only way we can restore the Servants Space Ishtar turned into treasure is to defeat her ourselves.

 
**Heroine XX:**
As if facing her the first time wasn't enough of a pain in the ass.

 
**Heroine XX:**
I only let that cosmic demon go free before because I thought she'd turned over a new leaf. Guess I was wrong.

 
**Heroine XX:**
All that aside though, I wonder what she's doing here on Earth?

 
**Heroine XX:**
Servantverse Servants aren't usually summoned unless there's some serious threat to the entire universe, or something on that level.

 
**Heroine XX:**
Maybe a Servant from the same setting paved the way for her? N-nah, that would just be silly! Hahahaha.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Say, where's our Ishtar right now, anyway?
 

 
**Mash:**
Her Spirit Origin reading is as strong as ever, but...I'm afraid we can't seem to find her.

 
**Heroine XX:**
She could've been assassinated ahead of time, or lured in by the prospect of jewels only to end up as one herself...

 
**Heroine XX:**
All I can say for sure is, there's no way that cosmic demon wouldn't have done something about her Earth counterpart.

 
**Heroine XX:**
It's always been her policy to cut down anyone who got in her way. By this point, the Ishtar you knew is probably just space dust now...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Um, King Gilgamesh?

 
**Mash:**
I understand you're exhausted, but do you think you could start acting like your usual royal self again soon?

 
**Mash:**
Space or not, she's still the same Ishtar you've dealt with countless times since the Age of Gods.

 
**Mash:**
Surely you must have any number of plans ready for dealing with a situation like this?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Forget it! Why should I concern myself with some mongrel from outer space!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Curses, how could the sacred sword wielder let this happen!? This sort of thing is supposed to be her problem to deal with!

 
**Heroine XX:**
Oou ang?
(Said while shoveling curry rice into her mouth)

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What the...!? You!? No, wait, it's not you.
Or...is it!? Oh, never mind!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
At any rate, I am not that worthless goddess's keeper, nor is it my job to clean up ridiculous messes like this.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
The rest of you can figure something out.
I'm going to Macau to have a proper vacation!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep, he's pouting hard now...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Guess I can't blame him for being upset after she showed him up...
 

 
**Shop Clerk:**
Are you really going to let this stand, King Gilgamesh?

 
**Shop Clerk:**
Even if this latest endeavor of yours was foiled by an unexpected interloper, it is still your endeavor.

 
**Shop Clerk:**
You can't wash your hands of it simply because she happened to stand out more than you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's the lady from the shop!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
■■■■■■...!
 

 
**Shop Clerk:**
Hello, everyone.
Thank you for keeping our king company once again.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What are you doing here? I thought you had gone over to Space Ishtar's side, seeing how you're still working the shop with a smile.

 
**Shop Clerk:**
As you'll recall, Your Majesty, I have always been the high priestess of the goddesses of Uruk. I am their faithful servant just as much as yours.

 
**Shop Clerk:**
Ishtar may be acting stranger than usual right now, but she still put me in change of the shop.

 
**Shop Clerk:**
Her exact words were “I'm going to liven things up here way more than Gilgamesh ever did, so I want you to take excellent care of the combatants.”

 
**Shop Clerk:**
As a citizen of Uruk, well, I could hardly refuse such a request. I had to see it through.

 
**Shop Clerk:**
Suffice to say, I was hoping to see which of you were better suited to be the life of the party, so to speak...

 
**Shop Clerk:**
...but it seems that was little more than a foolish dream.

 
**Shop Clerk:**
If simply being shown up is enough to make you turn tail and run, then how could you ever hope to match her?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Hmph. What nerve you have, to say such a thing to my face, to dare judge me, of all people.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Still, you are correct. My stepping down from the stage now would be giving Ishtar exactly what she wants.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
If I can no longer rule over this event as a king, then I can simply compete in it as any other warrior.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
After all, there is more than one star of this show. There is the champion, and there are also those who would challenge them.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Just like Fujimaru there has done to date.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does that mean you're going to fight alongside us!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yay! The King of Heroes joined our party!
 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Only because I have no other choice!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
As sick and extreeemely tired of it as I may be, someone has to show you how to properly go about dealing with a pesky goddess!

 
**Mash:**
This is great! King Gilgamesh is on his way to the combatants' entry gate!

 
**Mash:**
Come on, Senpai! We're going to rescue Emperor Nero, and all of New York City!

 
## Battle in New York 2021
 
**Dumuzid:**
Hi there. How's it going? And by “it” I mean life, of course. What else could it possibly be?

 
**Dumuzid:**
I'm the god of shepherds, bringing you safe and secure dreams no matter the circumstances.

 
**Dumuzid:**
I'm also the most trustworthy god of all, and the god who never takes responsibility for anything. That's right. It's yours truly, Dumuzid.

 
**Dumuzid:**
 
　　　　　　　　To recap:　　　　　　　　 
 
**Dumuzid:**
Space Ishtar, whose very name brings misfortune,
has changed the world with her invasion.

 
**Dumuzid:**
The King of Heroes has been deposed,
the shop continues to operate without much issue...

 
**Dumuzid:**
The Prize Roulette continues to spin like a hamster wheel, and all the Heroic Spirits are happy to continue participating in the tournament.

 
**Dumuzid:**
Wait, I'm sorry. The world hasn't actually changed at all. My bad.

 
**Dumuzid:**
Anyway, the battle is finally nearing its climax. I can feel my heart pounding. Does this mean I'm in love?

 
**Dumuzid:**
Why is the goddess searching for this Master?
Where did the real Ishtar go?

 
**Dumuzid:**
I know you have questions,
but that's not important now.

 
**Dumuzid:**
What matters is stopping Space Ishtar.

 
**Dumuzid:**
If I might be figurative, let's say she's a gorgeous bombshell. It doesn't matter how gorgeous she is; she's still inevitably going to go off.

 
**Dumuzid:**
As for me, I'm like the lit fuse marking the seconds until the blast. What's that? There's a lid for every pot? Well I, for one, am shocked.

 
**Dumuzid:**
At any rate, the fate of this tournament is now in the hands of Fujimaru and the King of Heroes.

 
**Dumuzid:**
Now is the time for them to defeat Space Ishtar and restore peace to the world. At least, that's the future I dream of.

 
**Dumuzid:**
But be warned. Ishtar is a shooting star streaking across the night sky.

 
**Dumuzid:**
And by that, I mean she's an intercontinental ballistic missile that's likely to detonate without much warning.

 
**Dumuzid:**
Also, Space Ishtar officially qualifies as a threat to mankind, so try to keep that in mind too. Dumuzid out.

 
**Mash:**
...All right, here we are at the second special stage of this year's tournament!

 
**Mash:**
With some help from the King of Heroes, we've managed to get this far, Senpai!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was fun!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Anything to help New York!
 

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Heh. I must commend your boldness in coming this far only to ignore the enemy directly before you.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Then again, Space Ishtar, or whatever your name was, perhaps you simply don't have what it takes to make a compelling antagonist!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Ugh, do you ever shut up, Goldie!?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Why is it that no matter which universe I go to, I always find a completely depraved Servant with your face!?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Fine then, since you've managed to get this far,
I'll come down there to meet you myself!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Prepare to feast your eyes upon Ishtar Ashtart, known through the Sapphire Galaxy as the goddess of creation...

 
**Space Ishtar:**
...and look upon her with equal parts fear and envy!!!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Well? Are you so overcome by my sheer godliness that your very souls have cashed out!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...
 

 
**Mash:**
...Well, you look pretty much exactly like the Ishtar we know, so...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Right... That's about what I should have expected from you. You didn't even get an animation update. Pathetic...

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Okay, now you're really pissing me off! Did you all forget that I'm an incredibly amazing goddess!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Whatever accomplishments you think you may claim are more than negated by the ceaseless trouble you cause, you fool! If proof is what you need, find a mirror!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now what have you gotten yourself possessed by?
Or is it just one of those placebo effect things?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Either way, you are clearly an impostor! Or rather, you're nothing more than the genuine, ordinary Ishtar! The sheer gall you have, calling yourself “Space” anything! What a joke!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Huh!? You're calling me an impostor!?
On what grounds!?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Did you forget I have this huge spaceship!?
It's got laser cannons and everything! Look!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Stop firing your damn lasers willy-nilly!
Are you trying to drown Chaldea in damage claims!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I'll admit, I don't know how you got your hands on that floating temple...but I expect you most likely just messed with some cursed object you should have left well alone.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You may have fooled me once with your Space moniker, but no more! You are clearly nothing more than the same ordinary Ishtar I tired of looking upon long ago!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And you call that a name change!? You should apologize to that “Super” Lancer who actually bothered to change his outfit!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
H-how dare you levy such slanderous accusations against the goddess of the Origin Universe! Now I'm really pissed!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I was planning to take it easy on this planet since it's still so underdeveloped, but no more! Now I'm going to destroy this entire stage, along with the city it's in!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I am the crimson goddess who bears shugurra, the crown of the empty plains of Edin. I am the young, wild quasar who ruled the ancient past from on high!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
If you truly have no fear of this great crown, then I will spare none of my energy on your defeat!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Bring it on!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Heh, well that is something. I see you at least have a bit more bluster than usual.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
While I certainly have no qualms about popping that overinflated ego of yours, given our history and our shared status as boss Servants, I will ask you one question as an act of mercy!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Tell me Ishtar, which did you drop!?
The gold Master, or the silver Master!?

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Wha&ndash;huh!? Uh, I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'll say...gold! I think!

 
**Mash:**
Ishtar has taken up her combat stance!
We're finally about to fight her, Master!

 
**Space Ishtar:**
Wait! Did you just say Master!? Does that mean Master was actually a person all along!?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Space Ishtar:**
Khh! How can Servants from a backwater planet like this be so strong!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It's over, Ishtar. Wipe off those absurd scribbles off yourself, drop this space pretense, and admit your defeat.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Do that, and Fujimaru and I will be willing to chalk this up to more of your usual antics.

 
**Space Ishtar:**
I hate to admit it, but...
it looks like this is it for me...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hahaha, I told you, there's no need for further dramatics. Though I can certainly understand how you wish you could disappear right about now.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But the only thing you need let go of is whatever it is that possessed you to attempt this latest nonsense. Getting rid of your Spirit Origin in the process would be taking the joke much too fa&ndash;Huh!?

 
**Mash:**
Um... I can confirm that the Holy Grail is now safely in our custody. But, I'm afraid, well...

 
**Mash:**
Ishtar's Spirit Origin has also completely disappeared! Wh-wh-what's going on, King Gilgamesh!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now you've done it, King of Heroes!
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Whoa, whoa, don't just blame me for this!
You were just as eager to fight her as I was!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Tell you what: we'll share the punishment for any criminal charges fifty-fifty! How does that sound!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does this mean...she really was from space!?
 

 
**Mash:**
The giant spaceship is falling apart! It almost looks like...it's dissolving into red flower petals...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Ishtar... You may have been a greedy nuisance who always went about stirring up trouble like a broken spin-dryer...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But now that you're gone, it makes me think that maybe, just maybe...we lost a good goddess today...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ishtar...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh goddess...
 

 
**Ishtar:**
Hey, what's up with all this red ash? Is this a normal thing in New York? No one told me!

 
**Ishtar:**
I know it's partly my fault for being late, since I thought this event was happening in San Francisco at first...

 
**Ishtar:**
...but is this really all the welcome I get after I cut my tour of the Golden Gate Bridge short?

 
**Mash:**
Oh!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Nn.

 
**Ishtar:**
Hm? What is it?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ishtaaar! It's really you!
 

 
**Ishtar:**
What the!? Where'd that come from!?

 
**Ishtar:**
Will you two calm down and get off me already!?
And knock it off with the crying too!

 
**Ishtar:**
Seriously, what's with you guys!?
What in the world happened while I was gone!?

 
**Ishtar:**
I see... Space Ishtar, huh? I mean, sure, I can teleport pretty much anywhere as long as it's near Venus...

 
**Ishtar:**
But do you really think I'd ever do anything that stupid? You should know me better than that by now.

 
**Mash:**
I...guess you have a point. Thinking back on it now, that giant spaceship did seem like something out of a dream...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh, New York, giant spaceships... It tracks.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I kinda expected the battle to be in Los Angeles, maybe, but here?
 

 
**Ishtar:**
What has that got to do with it!? I swear, you guys have watched way too many movies!

 
**Ishtar:**
And what were you thinking,
teaming up with them, Gilgamesh?

 
**Ishtar:**
I thought wisdom was your whole thing.
Well, that and being a pompous tyrant.

 
**Ishtar:**
Why in the world did you think that was really me? Did you just get so caught up in the excitement you forgot to take a step back and actually think about what was going on?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Don't look at me.
If anything, I'm the victim here...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To be fair, you did attack Uruk way back when...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To be fair, you pulled another stunt just a couple of summers ago, so...
 

 
**Ishtar:**
Well, uh... Okay, I guess I can't blame you for thinking of me like I'm some kind of invader from Venus, but still...

 
**Ishtar:**
Anyway, everything's all taken care of now, right?

 
**Ishtar:**
So turn those frowns upside down and quit moping about inadvertently killing me, okay? I'm fine! Obviously!

 
**Ishtar:**
Whoever this mysterious other Ishtar was, you already defeated her, didn't you?

 
**Ishtar:**
And since it looks like doing that restored all the people she'd captured back to their original selves, all's well that ends well!

 
**Ishtar:**
Not to mention she left a Holy Grail behind as a bonus! Really, what more could you ask for?

 
**Mash:**
...That's true. I still don't know exactly what that was all about...

 
**Mash:**
But you're right. The important thing is that you're okay, and New York is back to normal.

 
**Mash:**
I think we can and should just be happy about that, Master. Besides, there's something else we need to do right now.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You know it. Come on, let's go find Nero!
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes! I think that's our top priority right now too! And it looks like her energy signature's not too far away!

 
**Mash:**
I bet she'll even begin the award ceremony as soon as we get to the stadium!

 
**Mash:**
Hehe, we certainly had a lot of fun at this year's tournament as well, didn't we, Master?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Hmm. Something about all this doesn't sit right with me.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Was this invasion attempt made by someone merely pretending to be Ishtar? Or was she actually a version of Ishtar in her own right?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What do you think, Dumuzid? You're not going to tell me this was all just some fever dream, are you?

 
**Dumuzid:**
I only wish it had been. Unfortunately, there was real gravity to the threat that Ishtar posed...

 
**Dumuzid:**
...which means she was nearly identical to this one. If anything, I sensed even more primeval vibrations in her.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Did you now? Come to think of it, she did seem more reminiscent of how she was during the Age of Gods. Then are you saying she was a clone of Inanna?

 
**Dumuzid:**
The future is not set in stone. I don't know what it may hold. All I can say for sure is:

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You... You just wanted an excuse to say that, didn't you!?
