# Adventure of Singing Pumpkin Castle

## Prelude
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. I know you just woke up, but an invitation has arrived for you.

 
**Mash:**
Here you go. The envelope is traditional looking,
and extremely formal.

 
**Mash:**
There's no return address on it but clearly this is Senpai's name on the envelope.

 
**Mash:**
From the heading, it appears to be an invitation to a Halloween party.

Halloween! Is it already that time?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It is, indeed, that russet-colored season now.
In Japan, it's the time for viewing autumn foliage.

What's Halloween?
 
**Mash:**
You're not familiar with it?

 
**Mash:**
It was originally a year's end celebration in Celtic culture,
but it changed over time to become All Hallow's Eve...

 
**Mash:**
It's now a celebration put on the night before people offer up prayers to saints.

 
**Mash:**
Though, I haven't actually experienced a Halloween celebration...

 


---
 
**Mash:**
The bigger problem is the invitation itself, Senpai.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I happened to overhear your conversation.
A Halloween celebration, you say?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sounds fun! I love festive events like that! Back when the Director was with us, she would never approve such things...

...That's [♂ kinda /♀ a little] inappropriate, Doctor.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh... I guess it was. Sorry, that was my bad.
I'll be more careful from now on.

 
**Mash:**
The Doctor didn't mean any harm, Senpai.
Words just never go through his brain, as usual.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I feel absolutely ashamed... The greatest flaw of a science otaku is the utter lack of delicacy.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I really need to spend more time paying my respects to the late Director. This time I will put more time and emotion into it...

The Director is still alive.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh?! She's alive?!
Ah, I see. You mean she lives in our heart.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
After all, I feel the same way.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I never fail to clean the Director's Office, and I make daily offerings with her favorite dried fruit.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You know what, I think that tonight, I'll put up some pumpkin decorations in the Director's Office.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Although, Olga Marie never admits when she likes something. She'll probably say something like,
“What are these useless things?!”

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Okay, I need to stop. It's a celebration, and here I am dampening the mood with my talk.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahem! All right, let's turn this mood around&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But really, Fujimaru!
You're a smooth one, scoring an invitation like that!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Who could it be from?
I certainly don't recall sending you that.

 
**Mash:**
I didn't send it either, Doctor.
But if neither you nor I sent it, that means...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Undoubtedly, this is some kind of mischief. After all, letters from the outside world can't be delivered here.

 
**Mash:**
In any case, Senpai, let's read the invitation.

 
**Mash:**
Please rest assured that it is free of razor blades or any other dangerous items.

 
**Letter:**
Dear Fujimaru,  I am writing to inform you of a splendid Halloween party that is to take place.

 
**Letter:**
My little Castle Csejte is now completely remodeled!

 
**Letter:**
You'll be swallowed up in classic and dragonic decor☆

 
**Letter:**
I hereby humbly invite you to a dream-like night of elegance and wonder.

 
**Letter:**
At the party, you will find splendid pumpkin cuisine from the four corners of the world,

 
**Letter:**
as well as a splendid serenade from an adorable idol,
a sweet serenade from a young girl that will set your heart on fire,

 
**Letter:**
and a serenade that's sung by an unparalleled diva.
It all awaits you.

 
**Letter:**
Indeed, it shall be a grand ball that could set any soul alight. It will surely sink its teeth into your heart and savor it as well.

 
**Letter:**
Both your mind and body will have a deluxing experience! Won't you come and bask in the spectacular sensation of being mired in a nightmare?

 
**Letter:**
The theme is, “Sweet Blood Märchen Torture.”
I eagerly await your attendance.

 
**Letter:**
&mdash;Be sure to come, okay?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That is horrible!

 
**Mash:**
The fact that she emphasizes singing three times seems unbearably sinister to me.

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, what shall we do?

 This “deluxing” is supposed to be “relaxing,” isn't it?
 
**Mash:**
You're right. I wonder if she wrote it out of excitement or if she didn't know what she was saying.

>>>>>>> 7224cb4d1439411cdd384f20b83f30b3f0f6271e
So this “torture” bit is...
 
**Mash:**
She really means “torture.” To translate it accurately, it would be “Sweet, blood-covered, fairy tale-like, and torturous.”

 


---
 
**Mash:**
There's no signature on the invitation, but... Based on the content of the note, I have a good idea who sent it.

 
**Mash:**
A Servant who loves to sing... Loves to daydream...
And also enjoys blood and torture. It could only be...

**Dr. Roman:**
No, you must not utter another syllable. To speak her name is to summon her, Fujimaru!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just as speaking the truth isn't always the best idea,
spotting a disaster before it happens doesn't necessarily mean you can prevent it.

 
**Mash:**
So&mdash;precisely what are you trying to say, Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well... If you can't avoid a dangerous situation,
it's easier to charge in without a second thought!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That philosophy has gotten me through most problems or troubles that I've encountered.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooooooou!

 
**Mash:**
Let's just ignore Doctor's advice.
He doesn't understand human emotion whatsoever...

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai.
Are you planning to respond to the invitation?

 
**Mash:**
I've...never experienced an event of this kind, so I am interested, I suppose...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, the residual Spiritron information on this letter indicates its point of origin.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You could go anytime you want...
So what will you do, Fujimaru?

 As a matter of fact, I happen to love pumpkins.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh dear, you're not very honest, are you? But, if you love pumpkins so much, I suppose you'd better go.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She seems to have gathered some good materials.
I'll join you as well.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Then let's head out to the theme park of our dreams - a Halloween party!

 
**Mash:**
...Um.
We should bring lunch with us, shouldn't we?

 
## Section 1: Haunted Forest
 
**Mash:**
We've arrived. The time period is unknown but the location appears to be somewhere in Europe.

 
**Mash:**
That said... It feels both a bit frightening and yet fun, somehow. How odd.

 
**Mash:**
There are jack-o'-lanterns hanging all over the place,
and all the skeletons are dancing about.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou! Fa!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a much grander setup than I imagined...
Perhaps I underestimated her...

 
**Mash:**
Yes... Since this is Miss Ba...ry we're talking about,
I thought she'd be more of a paper decorations kind of girl...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Seems like we might need to pay extra attention here.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm picking up some weak hostile signatures here and there. There's no telling what could happen here.
Be on your guard as you investigate.

 
**Mash:**
Right, this was totally unexpected, so it's sure to be more than we bargained for!

 
**Mash:**
Now, let's go, Master!

 
**Mash:**
All that glitters isn't gold, but when in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say!

 
**???:**
Leave it there... Leave it there...
Leave some AP or stones and stuff there...

 
**Mash:**
Hmmph! So a ghost-type is the first up,
I see... How typical.

 
**Mash:**
It's far from surprising, but well, I suppose it is what it is.
It's the most basic of basics in a haunted house scenario.

 
**Mash:**
On second thought, this could be fun.
Senpai, quickly now! It's time for some ghost-busting!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Mash:**
I'm not picking up any more enemies nearby.
Those must've just been some strays.

 
**Mash:**
I suppose that's the quality of enemies you get right at the entrance. We need to find the real deal as soon as possible&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Um, shouldn't we head toward that totally suspicious-looking castle over there, Master?

That castle... An evil castle of blood... Ugh, my head!
 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I understand how you feel.
Do you need a tranquilizer?

You're in high spirits, aren't you, Mash?
 
**Mash:**
Yes, absolutely! Uh, I mean...
Of course I am, since this is our work and all.

 
**Mash:**
I wasn't hoping it would be like going to a real theme park or anything, um, definitely not!

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? ...Hmmm...
That's odd. Maybe this gauge is broken...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor? In your professional opinion, did you notice something odd about that ghost just now?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Eh, not really.
It was probably my imagination. Just forget it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(A nearby tremor in the Singularity... Really. It couldn't be. Hmmm, I'll just pretend I didn't see anything.)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You kids just go on enjoying yourselves. You'd best head to the castle first, like the invitation said.

 
**Mash:**
Of course we will! Let's head for the pumpkin village just beyond the forest!

 
**???:**
Eh heh heh, eh heh heh heh heh...
Eh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...

 
**???:**

**???:**

**???:**

**Fou:**
...Fou?
(Turns around, feeling a sudden cold chill)

 
## Section 2: I Will Come to Your Side, I Have Come
 
**Mash:**
It's further than I expected, but this town certainly looks more impressive than I imagined.

 
**Mash:**
What do you think, Master?
If you like, we could pause here for a moment to rest.

It'd be nice to eat some pumpkin pie.
 
**Mash:**
!!!
Good thinking, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
As good as being chosen by Weekly Halloween Magazine to receive the title of “This Autumn's Number One Master,” maybe?

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm, I'm not detecting any enemies near you.
Looks like you should be able to relax for a bit.

 
**Mash:**
All right, it's time for our homemade lunch then.
Here's to our super lunchtime!

 
**Kiyohime:**
My, how valiant.
In that case, shall I lay out a blanket to sit on?

 
**Mash:**
Ah, good idea. Please do.

 
**Kiyohime:**
There you are, Master. Please have a seat.
Here, these are homemade grilled rice balls.

Now that you mention it...
Why are you here, Kiyohime?

 
**Fou:**
Fofooooou!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my, I would've thought one's wife would naturally always be at one's side.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I went to the trouble of hiding for him in a box tied with a bow, but my silly husband is just so indifferent.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Then he went and fell for that unspeakably shady invitation. As your loving wife, I couldn't sit by and do nothing.

 
**Mash:**
How odd. Somehow, it feels as though the words I'm hearing and the actual written words are fatally irreconcilable.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Kiyohime:**
And that, basically, is why I've come here.
Fear not, I shall guard you flawlessly.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, 24 hours a day, from head to toe, from all directions, without a second's hesitation.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Go on now, let the fanfare sound!
For “Kiyohime is now your wife!”

But it's part of your charm, eh heh heh heh heh...

Well, I'm overwhelmed with anxiety for your future,
but what do you think, Mash?

 
**Mash:**
For once, I'm actually in agreement with you, Doctor...

Shall we depart?

 
**E：???:**
Heh, heh, heh...
It seems my next guest has finally come.

 
**F：???:**
Hee, hee, hee, the next guest is no one special.
All the most important guests seem to have arrived.

 
**F：???:**
Which is why this will be my very first and last love song.
Hmm, how melancholy.

 
**F：???:**
However, I doubt this is the last fool to come.
Oh fleeting Master, shall I just call you Oxygen?

 
**E：???:**
Oxy... What?
Truly, you say the strangest things sometimes...

 
**E：???:**
Anyways, even if this is both my first and last, that makes it all the more real for little ol' me!

 
**E：???:**
All the preparations are complete for me to make my grand entrance, right?

 
**F：???:**
Leave it to me, the food's all cooked!
It's my seven-spice blend chicken-turkey! It's delicious!

 
**E：???:**
Impressive... I hired you under the exaggerated boast that you were an all-powerful maid, but it seems you actually are all-powerful...

 
**E：???:**
Ah, but little ol' me will handle the main dish.
Be sure to leave some for me.

 
**F：???:**
Le...Leave that? Severed...meal? And... What meat now?
Stop using all these hard words, you lizard.

 
**F：???:**
But somehow, I understood it all. It's my habit to eat every bit of my breakfast. Namu Amida Butsu.

 
**E：???:**
Namu... What?

 
**F：???:**
It's a fancy phrase in Japan.

 
**F：???:**
I use it to mean, “Please forgive my brutality and depravity, for I am naught but a brutish beast.”

 
**E：???:**
...You're pretty knowledgeable sometimes, you know...

 
**E：???:**
Well, anyways.
Has everyone been dispatched?

 
**F：???:**
Good to go. Surrounded on all sides. You'll wait here with all the grace of a proper castle master, won't you?

 
**E：???:**
Yes, that way I can enjoy this banquet to the fullest.

 
**E：???:**
...
...

 
**E：???:**
Wait, I do have some free time after all...
Maybe little ol' me ought to go and meet them too?

 
**F：???:**
Hmm, I'll kill you then?

 
**E：???:**
I-I was just joking! Joking!
I just thought I'd try!

 
## Section 3: The Woman of Mirage
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I'm sensing a Servant.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes.
Make sure you stay behind me, my husband.

 
**Mash:**
Um, did you just say “my husband?”

 
**Kiyohime:**
I did. Why?

 
**Mash:**
Oh, um... No...
I was just wondering if that was the right term...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way, the original Japanese for husband means
“a person who looks after you,” so I think it's okay to use for either a man or a woman.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Isn't that great, Fujimaru?

**Fou:**
Fou... Fooouu...

 
**Mash:**
“This is bad, like Anchin bad...” Is that what you said?

 
**Mash:**
That won't do, Fou. Even if it's something everybody knows, this is where you keep quiet.

**E：???:**
Oh my, hehehe!
What cute guests we have!

 
**E：???:**
Welcome to our fantastic Halloween party!
My name is Mata Hari.

 
**Mata Hari:**
We have quite the party lined up for you tonight.
I hope you enjoy yourselves.

 
**Mata Hari:**
I'll get things started off with a dance.
One moment... (Strip, strip)

 
**Kiyohime:**

**Fou:**
Doufo&mdash;u?!

Wait a second!
Why are you taking off your clothes!?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Well, that is my specialty.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Ahhhh!
Indecent! Filthy! Lewd!

 
**Kiyohime:**
M-M-M-M-M-My husband! I will slay this indecent woman! How dare she show her bare skin!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Oh my, oh my!
Hehehe, if you prefer to do it that way, that's quite fine.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Tch.
(Silently deactivates recording mode.)

 
**Mash:**
Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I didn't do anything. Not a thing.
Unfortunately, it's time for combat.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Every party needs dancers.
Everyone, fight to your heart's content!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Mata Hari:**
Is the opening act done yet?
It's my turn now.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Behold the power of Mata Hari, the woman with the Eyes of the Sun! ...I guess that's a good opening.

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Mata Hari:**
Oh my, I lost.
You may proceed.

 
**Mata Hari:**
There's still much more song and dance for you to enjoy!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Deluxe to your heart's content!

 
**Mash:**
Servant Assassin has retreated.

It appears the party's just getting started.

I was just about to say that I didn't want a flashy ceremony!

This isn't... This isn't a job for nobility!

Oh... Sorry, I wasn't thinking.
We have to be sneaky, right Master?

 
**E：???:**
Damn this stupid spot! I'm all out of patience!
Take that! Phantom Maiden!

 
**E：???:**
There. Blew the whole thing to pieces.
That'll do. Good job, me.

 
**E：???:**
I am one of the most famous vampires on the planet...
I must be terrifying, beautiful, and merciless!

 
**E：???:**
...It's so noisy outside, though.
How many fireworks are they setting off?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my, how ugly!
She's like a Berserker, almost!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Look, my husband! She's not putting in any effort!
Of course, my cleaning skill is A+++ rank.

 
**E：???:**
Ahhhh!
H-How long have you people been there?

 
**Mash:**
Um, Kiyohime... I don't remember you having that skill.

I do. Look, I can burn burnable trash, and non-burnable trash. With my mouth.

You saw the dark, bloody banquet of Carmilla!

Did you guys see a bloody banquet? I didn't...

There was a banquet! You guys just couldn't see it!
I cooked the tomatoes!

I see... That's why your nails are red.
I was sure that's the real&mdash;Ahem. Excuse me.

This is a theme park of dreams.
Only unhappy fairy tales are allowed here!

 
**Mash:**
Anyway Carmilla, why are you getting so heated over cleaning?

 
**Carmilla:**
...Humph.
That stupid girl ordered me to.

 
**Carmilla:**
Aarrgh! Why does the Grail even exist?
Why did I end up a Servant?

The Grail? You mean THE Grail?

Yes. You may not believe it, but it's true.
Its power is what forced me to do this.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my... That must be terrible.
But&mdash;How fascinating.

Hahaha. She's more of a landmine than a firework.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Silence, you.

 
**Kiyohime:**
So far, I've been playing tourist, but now my goal has changed.

Oh my! You're so happy you shook your head both up and down AND side to side.

Enough talking, then.

 
**Kiyohime:**
You, Servant whose name I don't know.
Will you lead us to the mistress of this castle?

 
**Carmilla:**
You think I will?
I, Carmilla the Vampire?

 
**Carmilla:**
My role is to entertain the guests.
Now&mdash;enjoy this blood-freezing terror!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Carmilla:**
That concludes my warm-up.
Glad to see you have spirit, pigs.

 
**Carmilla:**
After I've brought you to your knees, I'll collar you and keep you as pets.

 
**Carmilla:**
Of course, as my slaves you'll have to clean for me!

 
**Carmilla:**
Now, are you ready? I'll use my Phantom Maiden to paint the walls with your blood!

 
**Mash:**
Um, wouldn't that just make an even bigger mess?

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Carmilla:**
Grr... That stupid dragon girl with her songs and dancing... No true noble would do such a thing...

 
**Carmilla:**
Hehehe, but perhaps this is for the best...
Oh, I'm about to...

 
**Carmilla:**
GYAN!

 
**Kiyohime:**
No slacking off from your cleaning by playing dead.

 
**Carmilla:**
(Sob, sob...)

 
**Kiyohime:**
So the dragon girl's got the Grail, huh?
I wonder what she wished for.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Well, I can guess.

 
**E：???:**
I see. So both Mata Hari and Carmilla have fallen.
Are the little [♂ Puppies /♀ Deerlets] suffering?

 
**F：???:**
Of course. Life itself is suffering.
Most people are always suffering.

 
**F：???:**
But at the same time, most suffering can be alleviated with the softness of a paw, or perhaps a tail.

 
**F：???:**
In other words, they don't suffer that much at all.
By the way, do we have enough carrot cake?

 
**E：???:**
&ndash;I see. Then make them suffer more.
More cruelty! More despair!

 
**E：???:**
That's the most important part of this Halloween party!

 
**F：???:**
First I've heard of it, but sure thing!
Kitty's ready for the banquet!

 
**E：???:**
Now come, little [♂ Puppies /♀ Deerlets]!
Come to me!

 
**E：???:**
I'll give you a welcome to make you wish you were never born!

 
## Section 5: Secret Joy of the Impaler
 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;Hmm, so you made it this far, huh?

 
**Vlad III:**
Carmilla went easy on you...
Or perhaps not.

 
**Vlad III:**
Very well then. I grant you the honor of fighting with Vlad Tepes, the Dracul.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my. We actually ran into a serious warrior for once.
Class-wise, he's the same as me, though.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Of course, no Berserker can rival me in elegance and breeding.

 
**Vlad III:**
You make me laugh, man-eater.
Your sin will scorch you from within.

 
**Vlad III:**
Both you and I have trod a wicked path.
Know that neither of us shall return to the light.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...That kind of ticked me off.
You will pay dearly for that.

 
**Vlad III:**
Of course. This is a banquet, a place for entertainment!
And so&mdash;

 
**Vlad III:**
Even the jesters must give it their all.

 
**Vlad III:**
As the ruler of a nation, I know the importance of festivals. Man needs circuses as well as bread.

 
**Mash:**
Wow... He's so serious! He's the one person who doesn't get the mood for this event!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In a sense, he's a true Berserker...
The only sane man in a world of the insane.

 
**Vlad III:**
&mdash;I find that a touch rude.
I consider myself a gentleman with a sense of humor.

 
**Vlad III:**
Mata Hari's dance was one of mirth.
Carmilla's dance was one of suffering.

 
**Vlad III:**
I would like to add a dance of my own, a dance of blood...

 
**Vlad III:**
But I must beg your forgiveness.
I'm afraid I'm much better at embroidery.

 
**Mash:**
...Embroidery?
Your hobby is embroidery?

 
**Mash:**
Did you make that splendid regalia yourself?

 
**Vlad III:**
Hahaha! How kind of you, milady.
But no, this was the work of a special tailor.

 
**Vlad III:**
I wanted to try my hand at it myself, but I had my position to think of.

 
**Vlad III:**
Young girl, if you like, I shall give you a lesson later.

 
**Vlad III:**
An applique of a praying man would decorate your master's clothes well.

 
**Mash:**
Vlad!

 
**Vlad III:**
But first, we must attend to the battle.
I've been asked to “hype up this party,” you see.

 
**Vlad III:**
And the best way to liven up this banquet, I believe&ndash;
Is with your screams.

 
**Vlad III:**
Let us begin with an appetizer.
Eat, as your bones scream in pain!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Vlad III:**
Indeed, banquets are splendid.
It was worth going along with that girl.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...So it's “that girl” after all?

 
**Vlad III:**
Of course. Out of all Servants, there are few who could spread such sweet delusions without shame.

Oh my... Master.
Your passionate gaze... It's making me blush.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, this isn't such a simple matter.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even with the Grail's power, for a Servant to summon another Servant...

 
**Vlad III:**
Be not afraid, foreign mage.
We simply&mdash;answered the summons ourselves.

 
**Vlad III:**
What she found was only a tiny sliver of the Grail.
It lacks the power to incinerate eras.

 
**Vlad III:**
She probably found it by chance during your battles at Orleans.

 
**Vlad III:**
It must be the blessing of God that it was entrusted to the most harmless Servant there.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...She doesn't seem harmless to me.

 
**Vlad III:**
She has the mind of a child.

 
**Vlad III:**
She's a very immature Servant who takes her childish thoughts and makes them real.

 
**Vlad III:**
She acts neither for good nor evil, nor for dreams or greed. She simply seeks her own entertainment.

 
**Vlad III:**
...But that's why it is fine.
Her entertainment is a pure joy, unlike ours.

 
**Vlad III:**
I know of it myself. Before I became the dragon who defended my nation, I, too, was once a father.

 
**Vlad III:**
Now, it's time for me to fight for real.

 
**Vlad III:**
My stakes have found their place in history.
And now you shall feel their wrath!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Vlad III:**
...Hmmph. Enough, I suppose.

 
**Mash:**
...He's barely scratched, isn't he?

It's harder than you think, always being called a vampire.

I wouldn't say that.
I'm the one who provided that cough drop.

I see... A pity.

Either way, so far we've dealt with Mata Hari, Carmilla, and Vlad III.

A one-night only concert, sung by Elisabeth Báthory in my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]'s room!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Tonight, and only tonight, I! SHALL! SING! LOUD!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Well? Surprised?
Moved to tears? You're moved to tears, right?

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Kiyohime:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Yes, I know what you all want to say, everyone.
Don't hold back. Let it all out.

 
**Mash:**
U-Um, Elisabeth?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Hmm? What is it?

 
**Mash:**
You could have just come to Chaldea, you know...

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? Of course not.
That's no fun.

 
**Elisabeth:**
Listen. An idol's concert is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

 
**Elisabeth:**
You brave the winter snow and summer heat,
lining up for your tickets.

 
**Elisabeth:**
You line up just to buy merchandise, you get packed into a crowded concert hall.

 
**Elisabeth:**
As the diva's serenade brings you to the heights of ecstasy and madness, you fall in love!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, quite right. You're quite right, Elisabeth.
The job of an idol in the first place is to...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, if you don't want me confiscating your laptop,
please shut up.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, I'll shut up.
Lady Elisabeth, please continue!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, may I?
Umm, then&mdash;Ahem.

 
**Elisabeth:**
So, you see? It's important for an idol to keep their fans waiting. So...

 
**Elisabeth:**
If I just showed up in my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]'s room and started singing, I'd be a heartless demon, right?

 
**Elisabeth:**
My songs only truly shine after a long and perilous journey.

 
**Elisabeth:**
I couldn't deprive you of such a woooonnnderful feast for the ears!

 
**Mash:**
So you didn't send the invitation to Csejte so that we could enjoy a Halloween party...

 
**Mash:**
...but so that Master could listen to your songs?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Correct. It was a cruel trial, to make my songs all the more wonderful. Splendid, yes?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh. My. That. Is. Amazing.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Our reward. For four Servant battles.
Is one of your songs.

 
**Elisabeth:**
EXACTLY!
(Dazzling smile)

 
**Kiyohime:**
My head. Has overheated. With rage.
And something else.

 
**Mash:**
K-Kiyohime! Get a hold of yourself!

 
**Kiyohime:**
M-My husband... Kiyohime is done for...
Something within me that must never snap has snapped.

**Kiyohime:**
Sob... I'm telling the truth, and you're so cold to me...
But I know that's what a Master is, now...

 
**Kiyohime:**
That aside&ndash;You! Count Dracu-dumb!

 
**Kiyohime:**
At this point, what's the difference between defeating four Servants and beating the stuffing out of five?

 
**Kiyohime:**
I'll incinerate the lot of you!
No dust left! No ash left!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? Huh? Why are you mad at me?
Argh! Don't burn down the stage!

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's more of a death-y metal-y thing!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Oh, you wanna fight?
Okay, then.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I summon the pumpkin heads I called to liven the place up! Now the whole concert hall's full!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Now, my (true) Master and my (temporary) Master!
I'm exhausted, but it's time for the concert!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Kiyohime:**
Hehehe.
I'm in top condition tonight!

 
**Kiyohime:**
I feel like I could ignite flames of love just by meeting someone's gaze!

 
**Kiyohime:**
My husband!
Look deep into my eyes, please!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Splendid! Wonderful! This wasn't what I anticipated,
but it was a lot of fun anyway!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm really getting into this!
I feel like my songs&ndash;can save the world!

 
**Elisabeth:**
It's time for the finale! I am Caster Elisabeth!
&ndash;Listen to my true song!

 
**--BATTLE--</b>
 
**Elisabeth:**
Aah... That's enough singing.
I'm so satisfied...

 
**Mash:**
Holy Grail confirmed! Recovering!

 
**Elisabeth:**
That felt so good!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Songs truly are the noblest art, and idols are Phantasms created by the stars!

**Kiyohime:**
My throat's parched, but worse, my ears hurt...

 
**Kiyohime:**
It's not even remotely fair that Count Dracu-dumb is in better shape than us.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
A poisonous snake can bite their own tail and still survive, after all.

**Mash:**
...Master, this wasn't quite what I expected, but we did manage to recover a fragment of the Grail.

 
**Mash:**
If we take this back to Chaldea, we'll gain a valuable source of magical energy.

 
**Mash:**
So all that's left to do is go home.

 
**Mash:**
Or, wait. This is your room,
so perhaps we don't even need to do that?

 
**Mash:**
My head feels so dizzy I can't think...

**Tamamo Cat:**
Hey, question for you guys.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
My (temporary) Master looks like they've got a bad case of the shakes. They okay?

 
**Mash:**
Huh?
Oh! M-Master!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
My husband! Hang in there, my husband!

 
**Elisabeth:**
The heat from the concert got to them...
I understand that. Perhaps it was too good.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
No, that doesn't seem right.
But I decided not to say so.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Are you okay, my husband?

Oh, the question mark means you're not lying, right?
We still have to be careful.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Please stay still, and rest your head, heart, and ears.

**Elisabeth:**
Yes, yes, you're right.

 
**Elisabeth:**
You're never going to have a private concert like this again! Probably.

 
**Elisabeth:**
It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience!
Of course you've had your fill!

 
**Mash:**
Um... I think that meant,
“Please, make it stop. I'm begging you.”

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ssh! Stay quiet and she'll think this is a happy ending, woof!

Worry not, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! You may have had your fill,
but there's always room for cake!

Don't die on me, Master!

Oh, jeez! Dracu-dumb here is unstoppable when she's singing, isn't she?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Wake up, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Good, good. Good morning, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!

 
**Elisabeth:**
What? In the idol business we say
“good morning” no matter what time it is.

 
**Elisabeth:**
You enjoyed Halloween, right?
I had a great time!

 
**Elisabeth:**
...
...Umm.

 
**Elisabeth:**
So, um, well...
I'm not sure if it's the power of that Grail or what, but...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...But I forgot how to get home.
So can I stay with you, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?

 
**Elisabeth:**
You wouldn't leave a little lost dragon out in the rain, would you?

I am sure!
I even gave up my prison castle for you!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? Then it's okay?
You're asking me if I'll stop being bad?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Of course, I'll stop being bad!
...Wait, did I ever do anything bad?

**Elisabeth:**
Anyway, the contract is made!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I may not be an official Servant,
summoned at Chaldea, but...

 
**Elisabeth:**
...I'll do my best to serve you, so do your best to raise me, Master!
