# GUDAGUDA Honnoji

## Prologue: The Warring Era of Heroic Spirits
 
**Dr. Roman:**
An intruder in Chaldea!
Again? Where are they from?

 
**Da Vinci:**
They seem to have directly entered from a different phase space. But this response? I wonder what this is.

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, is it an emergency?
Oh, Senpai, good morning.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You look cheerful again today.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, of course. It's good to be cheerful.
I also had a delicious breakfast today.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think you're acting a little too calm!
Greetings are important, but for now, intruder!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What was breakfast?
 
**Mash:**
Fried eggs, seaweed, and miso soup, with stewed pumpkins for dessert.

 
**Mash:**
Even rationing out what little we have stored, I believe this was a frugal yet complete meal.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Pumpkin, huh. We did harvest a lot, so there is an excess of them.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No wait!
Intruder, the intruder!

 

 
**Mash:**
Oh my, I'll go intercept them right away.
Senpai, please do the honors.

 
**Mash:**
The response was from around here...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, behind you!

 
**Mash:**
Wh&ndash;?

 
**H：???:**
Nobu nobuu!

 
**Mash:**
?!?!?!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wha&ndash;?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh?
 

 
**H：???:**
Nobu nobuu!

 
**Mash:**
What is this thing?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Be careful, Mash. It may look like a joke, but it's displaying high combat capabilities.

 
**H：???:**
Nobbuu!

 
**Mash:**
Master!
Look out!

 
**D：???:**
Stop right there!

 
**H：???:**
Nobu!?

 
**Mash:**
W-Who are you?

 
**D：???:**
Nice to meet you. I'm from Shinsen&ndash;
Uh... Let's see... Just call me Sakura Saber.

 
**Mash:**
Sakura... Saber?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Yes. I materialized in this world to pursue that mysterious creature...

 
**E：???:**
Wait, wait, man-slayer!
Don't leave me behind!

 
**E：???:**
Sheesh, my normal self could take them out like it was nothing, but this is rather hard on me...

 
**Mash:**
U-Um, the two of you are?

 
**E：???:**
Hmm? Me? I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Nobu&ndash; No, Demon, right! I'm Demon Archer!

 
**Mash:**
Demon Archer and Sakura Saber...
I see.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If I could interrupt, I figured out where that thing spawned. It's a different phase space that collided with Chaldea.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We have to destroy the source of the problem.
Or else, Chaldea will be filled with strange creatures.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I finished calculating the coordinates for the Rayshift.
Go in there and get rid of them quick!

 
**Mash:**
Understood! I'll hurry over with Senpai!
Um, by the way, what will you two do?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
We're hoping to do the same thing you're trying to do.
Please let us come along with you.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
If that's okay with you?
Archer?

 
**Demon Archer:**
All right, all right. Well, it is our problem and I've grown tired of chasing after them...

 
**Demon Archer:**
Very well! The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven,
Demon Archer will lend you a hand!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, once you all Rayshift, I'll lock the system down.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There. Now we can have some peace of mind.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way, those two Servants...
How did they directly materialize into Chaldea?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, it looks like we got connected to a strange space by an astronomical probability.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Look at the conditions they're Rayshifting into. What's this? Phenomena Corruption from another phase space?

 
**Da Vinci:**
In any case, it's pretty terrible.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow... What's this? A group of strange creatures, and something else? They're not quite Shadow Servants...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Either way, I believe Fujimaru will be able to do something about it&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Now it's time for me to go back to bed.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sleepy because I was sending messages to Magi☆Mari till really late last night.

 
**Da Vinci:**
You kept sending her messages and she just kept yelling at you... Is that some sort of punishment?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not a punishment, it's a reward!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Though, I need to take a nap or something to reset my mind and regain my footing...

 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? It's you, Fou. You were left behind? Eh?
You had a bad feeling so you didn't want to go?

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Mash:**
Rayshift complete, but...
Where are we?

 
**Demon Archer:**
It seems the Imperial Holy Grail lost control and created a separate dimension within this phase space.

 
**Mash:**
Imperial... Holy Grail?
What is that?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
We can talk later.
They're coming!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
The Grail&mdash;is out of control?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Yes. There was a Holy Grail War in our world,
but the Grail was tampered with by some strange technology.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
At the end of all that tampering, its power got out of control...

 
**Demon Archer:**
Unfortunately, I got involved in the accident and my subconscious materialized.
It's starting to&mdash;corrupt reality.

 
**Demon Archer:**
Worst of all, it took away most of my power. Originally I should be OP like a Last Boss, but now I'm like a 0.5 star Servant...

 
**Demon Archer:**
In short, I got nerfed to a level 1 noob.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Star?
 
**Demon Archer:**
With my power, I should've been a 5-star character.
Why did it end up like this...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you're one of those...
 
**Sakura Saber:**
I'm sorry our Archer is causing you so much trouble.

 

 
**Mash:**
So that indescribable creature is the manifestation of Demon Archer's subconscious and power?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Y-Yeah. I don't quite understand it myself,
but that seems to be the case.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How irresponsible...
 
**Sakura Saber:**
This has nothing to do with you,
I'm sorry that you've gotten involved.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
It's basically all Archer's fault, so please complain to her as much as you want.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It only has one eye...
 
**Demon Archer:**
I-It's only being hidden by hair, yes?
See, it's just like Mash over there!

 
**Mash:**
Don't lump me in with that thing!

 

 
**Mash:**
By the way, I found this during the earlier battle.
...A bowl? Perhaps? And a steel pot?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Looks like the magical energy leaking from the Grail copied what's “valuable” in my mind.

 
**Mash:**
Valuable? A black pot and an old bowl...
They don't look like they're that valuable...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Mash, can I have a look at them?
Hmm, hmm...

 
**Da Vinci:**
What is this? Such dusty looking vessels are valuable in the Far East?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Rude Westerners! Rikyu will punch you for not understanding value in the simple and subdued!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, even if you claim this is valuable...
Wait, now that you mention it...

 
**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;I'm curious! These tea set-like things?
My workshop will take them!

 
**Mash:**
You're interested in them?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Just look at this black, unsightly teapot!
Quality iron, smooth to the touch...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...But is super dull in shape and color. Still, I feel like it has an indescribable charm, or maybe not so much?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's what she meant by “simple and subdued!”
 
**Demon Archer:**
Oh, you are quite knowledgeable.
I'll make you some tea later.

 
**Demon Archer:**
Let's see, I'll rent out an entire temple somewhere...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Won't it explode?
 
**Sakura Saber:**
No, no, there is no way a teapot could ever explode.

 
**Demon Archer:**
You think so?

 

 
**Mash:**
I-In any case, let's head towards the center of this Singularity.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
We somewhat forced your hand for assistance,
but I hope we can work together well.

 
**Demon Archer:**
Right! Let's go, everyone!
On to the journey that will unify this nation by force!

 
## Act 1: Sneak Attack!! GUDAGUDA Okehazama
 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
All right, we'll set up camp here! Ben&ndash; I mean,
Sessai, prepare for a banquet. In two seconds.

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
Two seconds? Oh I'm sorry, right away!
Please don't put your hand on your blade.

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
However, my lord, camping in a place like this is dangerous. Don't let your guard down.

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
I am fully aware of that. After all, I'm a genius.
I don't mind danger and stuff.

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
If we're attacked, we wake right up and attack back.
Enemies can't easily approach an army this size to begin with.

 
**Mini-Nobu:**
Nobu nobuu!

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
See, this mysterious creature says so, too.
Ben&ndash; I mean, Sessai, you worry too much.

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
I see...
I hope nothing serious ends up happening...

 
**Mash:**
Looks like some Servants are bringing those strange creatures along with them...

 
**Demon Archer:**
Hmm, it seems they brainwash Servants summoned by the Holy Grail, and then they put those Servants to work...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Those do look like Heroic Spirits, but something's odd.Maybe some unnecessary factors got mixed in during their summons.

 
**Mash:**
In any case, it'll be difficult to fight an army that large.
What should we do?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Indeed, this calls for&mdash; a night raid, of course!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Night raid?
 
**Demon Archer:**
That's right! It's the best way for a few to attack many!
By the way, when I was young...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's like Okehazama!
 
**Demon Archer:**
You study hard, I'm impressed! Yes, with that battle I revealed my intention to unify the nation!

 

 
**Sakura Saber:**
I'll catch the enemy's attention. Everyone, ambush the main army when you get the chance!

 
**Demon Archer:**
Listen to me!

 
**Mash:**
Sakura Saber, will you be okay going alone?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Despite my looks, I'm used to dealing with large groups,
and those trivial enemies can't possibly defea...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Kugh?! (coughs blood)

 
**Mash:**
Whaaaaaat?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A-Are you all right!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
MEDIC!
 

 
**Sakura Saber:**
D-Don't be alarmed...
This is simply a skill of mine...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Sometimes I'm unable to act, or I'm defenseless before an enemy. That's all this ability does...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What kind of useless skill is that?
 
**Sakura Saber:**
(Sob) After all, I'm a useless soldier.
Who made the Bakumatsu like that?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see, that's pretty fatal!
 
**Sakura Saber:**
It's not as if I like having this skill!
I can't remove it even if I wanted to!

 

 
**???:**
Hmm?
Who's making a fuss over there?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Come on! See, now they found us because you were making so much noise!

 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
Are you the insolent bunch after Lord Yoshitsune?
You have some nerve attacking an army this large.

 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
...But I respect your courage! Therefore I, Matsudaira Arash, the vanguard of this troop,

 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
the best archer in these seas&mdash;no, the best archer in the Orient! &mdash;will rain punishment down on you!

 
**Mash:**
I am so confused right now!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
This isn't good...
But it's not over yet...

 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
I will show you...
This attack has all my body and soul poured into it!

 
**Demon Archer:**
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Looks like there's a lot of power going into that.

 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway, let's run away!

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Everything's a mess right now, but we have no choice.
Run!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where can we run to?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But that's...
 

 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
It's impossible to run from my bow.
Its range is 2,500 kilometers!

 
**Demon Archer:**
That's not a bow anymore!

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
The moon is nice tonight, Benkei...
I mean, Sessai.

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
You ended up saying my whole name, my lord.
The moon is indeed lovely, but still...

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
Strange people seem to be approaching us...
Do you know who they are?

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
I wonder if they're the patrol that Matsudaira sent out.

 
**Demon Archer :**
Move, move!
Get out of our way!

 
**Mash:**
Sorry, we're going to pass through here!

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
...They're gone now.
I wonder what that was about?

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
So, Benkei... I mean Sessai.
There's one more thing I wanted to ask.

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
Did we shoot off some fireworks during the feast?

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
No, I didn't hear about that...

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
Then what's that light streaking across the sky like a shooting star...

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
It's shining brightly, like a shooting star indeed.

 
**Matsudaira Arash:**
Stella&mdash;!

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
Th-This can't be. This huge army, in an instant...
Forgive me, brother, but our dream of resurrecting the Kamakura shogunate is...

 
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**
Ah, please stop trying to hit me with a rice spoon from beyond the mountains... (snore)

 
**Musashibou Sessai:**
That's why I told you not to let your guard down...
Anyway, let's get out of here while we're still standing...

 
**Mash:**
All enemy Servant signatures have vanished...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Well, this is kind of...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What a mess...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's Stella for you...
 

 
**Demon Archer:**
It can't be helped!

 
## Act 2: Dashing!! GUDAGUDA Three Line Formation
 
**Takeda Darius:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanada Medusa:**
Finally the time has come to settle the score,
Fool of Owari! ...So my boss says.

 
**Takeda Darius:**
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanada Medusa:**
Bare your corpses before the Takeda Cavalry.
...So my boss says.

 
**Demon Archer:**
But it looks like you're just riding an elephant...

 
**Takeda Darius:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanada Medusa:**
Don't worry about the details. It'll make you go bald!
...So my boss says.

 
**Demon Archer:**
You should be the one worrying!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Takeda Darius:**
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]&ndash;!

 
**Sanada Medusa:**
L-Let's plant our flag in Persia.
...So my boss says.

 
**Sanada Medusa:**
Oh, I'm done here?
Yay...

 
**Mash:**
W-We managed to defeat them... But it seems like Rider wasn't really that interested in the first place.

 
**Demon Archer:**
It seemed like my famous cavalry-killing Three Line Formation didn't do that much to Rider?

 
**Mash:**
Uh, well, that's...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Now that you mention it, it seemed like arrows hurt more than usual...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's just your imagination.
 
**Sakura Saber:**
Speaking of classes, we haven't heard of yours, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
You wouldn't see one in a normal Holy Grail War, but...
I'm a Shielder, and we focus on defense.

 
**Demon Archer:**
A class focused on defense. That's unusual.
But, your chest does look squishy enough to repel anything I throw at it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Affinity matters, doesn't it?
 
**Demon Archer:**
Now that you mention it, Mash doesn't seem to be affected by affinities.

 
**Mash:**
Right! I'm a Shielder, so you can leave all the defense to me!

 
**Sakura Saber:**
I'm kind of jealous since I've got a fragile body.
Are those boobs the secret to defense?

 

 
**Mash:**
That part doesn't matter!

 
**???:**
Behold! I am the true god of war, Uesugi Altria!
Takeda Darius, it's time for our fated duel!

 
**Mash:**
A new Servant?
Master, get ready for battle!

 
**Demon Archer:**
What? Uesugi? ...Wait, you're a girl? The Dragon of Echigo can't be a girl! Go back and start over!

 
**Sakura Saber:**
I don't think we can say that...

 
**Uesugi Altria:**
No, there are theories saying I could be a girl...
Anyway... Where is my fated rival, Takeda Darius?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Huh? He got eliminated just now...

 
**Uesugi Altria:**
What! I came all the way from Kasugayama just to fight,
and it was all a waste...

 
**Uesugi Altria:**
I wanted to take Kai's food and eat to my heart's content...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please leave.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Warring States economy is so cruel.
 

 
**Uesugi Altria:**
Oh... Well, that's just how it goes!
For my food... No, for my people!

 
**Uesugi Altria:**
I'll take your rations instead!
I have the divine protection of Vaisravana on my side!

 
**Demon Archer:**
The Warring States period really was like this!
What a pain!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Uesugi Altria:**
I can't believe I lost... It must be because I stopped myself at only three bowls of rice this morning...

 
**Uesugi Altria:**
By the way, this is completely unrelated,
but I think my shadow is getting...thinner?

 
**Mash:**
That was a tough battle, Senpai.
All the Servants seemed kind of strange...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, they did.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You just noticed?
 

 
**E：Demon Archer:**
It seems like when they were summoned, factors of the generals I considered my enemies were mixed in.

 
**D：Sakura Saber:**
So it's your fault again...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is bad! Fujimaru, Mash!
Get away from there immediately!

 
**Mash:**
What? What's going on, Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I was a bit groggy when I woke up, and was just casually looking into that space's composition...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...when I discovered a certain particle spreading there.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A fascinating, funny particle that infects Servant spirit cores, causing bad stuff to happen!

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What was that?
What kind of “bad stuff” are we talking about?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Weakened status, modified memories, damaged spirit core. But out of everything that could happen this is the worst...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
“You become a disappointment!”

 
**Mash:**
Huh? A disappointment?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, a disappointment.

 
**Mash:**
N-Now that you mention it, there was that Uesugi and that Imagawa from before...

 
**Mash:**
This is bad, Senpai!
We need to get out of here before we go kaput!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're going to go kaput?
 
**Mash:**
That's right!
We can't go kaput!

 
**Mash:**
We might end up like that weird creature!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash has already been contaminated...
 
**Mash:**
Huh? I-Is there something wrong? Anyway, let's go take a bath and wash it off or something!

 

 
**Mash:**
Huh? It doesn't seem like Sakura Saber or Demon Archer have changed at all...

 
**E：Demon Archer:**
Hmm. We haven't changed at all...

 
**D：Sakura Saber:**
I'm my same old blood-coughing self.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, maybe you two were already a disappointment to begin with.

 
**Archer & Saber:**
What? (x2)

 
## Act 3: Predicament!! GUDAGUDA Encircling Net
 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
So I guess it's our turn now...
But why do I have to be teamed up with you guys?

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
I know it's a Servant's job to obey once summoned,
but I would have loved the chance to refuse this time around...

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
That's what I wanted to say! And what's up with this weird space? The flow of magical energy coming from the Grail is really strange.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
The Grail's being used for something unnecessary again.
Don't you want to have a proper Holy Grail War?

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
As expected of a witch from the Age of Gods.
You've seen through this trickery?

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Of course.
...Not that I can do anything about it, though.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
You know how there's supposedly a familiar made from the flesh of corpses?

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Flesh...enstein, was it?
That is what's happening with the Grail this time.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
A lot of things got tampered with, and it turned into something weird...

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
It's a pain. Anyway, it seems like they're coming.
Do you have a plan?

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Well first, Lancer... Shimazu Sétanta, was it?
I want you to lure the enemy in.

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
You want me to be bait? Leave it to me.
But...Why am I the only one with a childhood name...

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
At least that's your real name!
What's up with my Mouri or whatever?

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
A general from the Warring States period? What's that?
I don't know anything about the history of the Far East!

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
Hm, a grand strategist and the Witch of Betrayal.
The Grail certainly made strange pairings.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
You there, don't look like you understand everything.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
I want you to hit enemies lured in from the sides.
An ambush, basically.

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
So it's like a guerilla attack. How clever. You're getting accustomed to this strategist thing, aren't you, Caster?

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
&mdash;So what are you going to do, Caster?

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Me? I'm just a weak witch and waifu, right?
I won't be joining in trivial matters like that.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Though I could charge my NP super fast and go nuts with my Rule Breaker...

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
I mean, apparently my younger version is getting summoned and taking the spotlight.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
This time I'd like to keep my sweet, ladylike image.

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Though I'm still pretty young, you know?

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
Okay, this is getting too long!
Let's go!

 
**Mini-Nobu:**
Nobu, nobu!

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
Ah, be careful, Lancer.
By the way, is that creature a dude?

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
Anyway, give me your hearts!

 
**Demon Archer:**
What! My heart?

 
**Mash:**
It hasn't been taken yet! Anyway, we need to intercept them! Huh? Where's Sakura Saber?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Sorry, I'm feeling sick today...
Cough!

 
**Mash:**
This is bad! Without Saber, fighting a Lancer class is going to be difficult!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sakura Saber's really difficult to deal with...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're talking kinda funny!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're right. What should I do? I know!
Let's ask Magi☆Mari! (Escape from reality)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even the Doctor's been contaminated...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chaldea should have been quarantined...
Da Vinci, please make a vaccine!

 

 
**Demon Archer:**
You unreliable man-slayer... Huh?
What? What's going on? He's running away.

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
They have more people than our scout reported!
I need to pull back for now.

 
**Mash:**
I don't really get it, but this is our chance!
Let's go after him, Senpai!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right! After him!
 
**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight, charging in!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I'll carry Sakura Saber on my back.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
...Thanks for always helping me, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
This is the first time!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've got a bad feeling about this...
 
**Demon Archer:**
Oh, shut it.
Follow me!

 
**Demon Archer:**
Hurry up and recover, man-slayer, or you're going to get labeled a useless Servant!

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Strong Servant, weak Servant.
That's up to them...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
A truly strong Master will...
(Cough!)

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, please get some rest!

 

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
Oh, so they actually managed to catch up...

 
**Demon Archer:**
Hahahaha! We've got you now, Shimazu... or whatever your name is! Now prepare yourself!

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
Yea, I think&mdash; You're the ones who need to prepare yourselves.

 
**Mash:**
What? We're being hit!
From where?

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
Looks like Lancer led you right into our trap.
Time to show you the power of an Archer.

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
Trace on!
Broken Phantasm: Shoot!

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
When am I going to use this bow?
That'd be right now! Fiiiiiish!

 
**Demon Archer:**
What is this rain of arrows? Is it an ambush?
Oh, so when you ambush someone you want to...

 
**Mash:**
This is no time for explanations!
We're not in some kind of seminar!

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Ha, ha, ha. You dummies fell right into my plan.
Good work, Lancer! I'll buy you some bread later.

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
Are you treating me like a kid?
Get something with yakisoba in it. Nothing spicy!

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
...You guys should be more cautious.
Me running away should've alerted you.

 
**Demon Archer:**
How could I be so careless... There's been no greater shame since Kanegasaki, Nagamasa...

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
Looks like you've given up.
What are you planning on doing with them, Caster?

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Let's see...
What should we do with them?

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, Senpai...
If only Sakura Saber could fight with us...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't give up!
 
**Mash:**
Do you have a plan that could get us out of this?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Well if Monkey or Micchi were here, we could leave this to them and run away...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How do you feel?
 
**Sakura Saber:**
... (Dead silent)

 
**Demon Archer:**
No response.
She's on her last legs.

 
**Demon Archer:**
Looks like we got a faulty Saber.
Thanks for your service.

 

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Hahahahaha! Before Mouri Medinari, you're like a moth drawn to a flame!

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
...Am I playing the bad guy role a bit too heavy?

 
**Sakura Saber:**
...Mouri?

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
You were always the bad guy.

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
In any case, I guess my role here as Shimazu or whatever is over.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
...Shimazu?

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
I have no clue why I ended up as Chousokabe, but I guess that's the way it goes.

 
**Sakura Saber:**
...Chousokabe...
Tosa?

 
**Mash:**
...What?
Sakura Saber is...

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Uuuoohhhh!

 
**Sakura Saber:**
...With sadness and misplaced anger giving me power,
I shall now don the haori of my oath!

 
**Sakura Saber:**
Satsuma and Choshu shall die!
No mercy!

 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Huh? Satsuma and Choshu? What's that?
This girl is completely different now! I'm scared!

 
**Demon Archer:**
I shall explain!

 
**Mash:**
Eek! That caught me off guard!

 
**Demon Archer:**
This feeble man-slayer, known as Sakura Saber...
Her True Name echoed through the streets of Kyoto at the end of the shogunate.

 
**Demon Archer:**
The one who swore to kill all Satsuma and Choshu...
The captain of the Shinsengumi's First Unit, Okita Souji!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All of a sudden you reveal her True Name?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So you mean Okita Souji is a girl?
Though, I guess I'm used to that by now!

 
**Mash:**
I'm not really knowledgeable about that era, but is she a famous Heroic Spirit, Senpai?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pretty famous in Japan.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wow, a girl, no way. (lifeless)
 

 
**Demon Archer:**
By the way, my True Name is Oda No&ndash;

 
**Demon Archer:**
It's finally time to pay Satsuma and Choshu back for Toba-Fushimi, Mr. Kondou!

 
**Demon Archer:**
Yes! Also, I can't really forgive Tosa, either!

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
There's the Satcho Alliance too, so that can't be helped.
But, I am the one that's troubled for being called Chousokabe.

 
**Okita Souji:**
Shinsengumi's First Unit Captain, Okita Souji!
Here I come!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mouri Medinari:**
Ah... The old me is so pitiful it hurts...

 
**Shimazu Sétanta:**
Oh my mentor, I'm sorry...
By the way, that bodysuit...

 
**Chousokabe Emichika:**
Indeed, this is a bit stranger than expected...

 
**Okita Souji:**
Haaah, haaah... I-I did it, Mr. Hijikata... (Passes out)

 
**Mash:**
When Sakura Saber... I mean, when Okita donned her haori, she was ferocious, huh, Senpai?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
As expected of the genius swordsman.
 
**Mash:**
If she was in the First Squad, does that mean there were other powerful swordsmen in the Shinsengumi?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She collapsed again...
 
**Mash:**
Hang in there, Okita!
Have this Golden Fruit!

 

 
**Demon Archer:**
By the way, you're not interested in my True Name?
I'm super famous in the Far East.

 
**Demon Archer:**
It's hard, you know, being such a popular Heroic Spirit!
Everybody wants a piece of me.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, it's time for lunch, Senpai.
I packed us some.

 
**Demon Archer:**
Guess nobody cares, huh?

 
## Act 4: Overwhelming Victory!! GUDAGUDA Tenka Fubu
 
**Demon Archer:**
I'm getting tired of this, actually...

 
**Mash:**
But that's so irresponsible!

 
**Okita Souji:**
This is all your fault to begin with, so you'd better see it till the end!

 
**Mash:**
Okita, what was your relationship like with Demon Archer in your home world?

 
**Demon Archer:**
I don't know what to say... She's annoying.
Especially when she warps around.

 
**Okita Souji:**
Look who's talking!

 
**Okita Souji:**
If you hadn't tried to convert the Grail into a bomb,
this never would've happened!

 
**Mash:**
You turned the Grail&mdash;into a bomb!?

 
**Demon Archer:**
Yes, I planned to use it as a superweapon to turn things around.

 
**Demon Archer:**
But I screwed up and fell headfirst into the reactor core as it was reconstructing...

 
**Demon Archer:**
Because of that, my powers were taken and weird creatures were born. It's unbelievable.

 
**Mash:**
I don't understand, but now I know that you were up to some crazy things...

 
**Okita Souji:**
Oh, we made it here while she was blabbing.
This is the heart of this Singularity, Osaka... I think?

 
**Demon Archer:**
This is clearly some European town...

 
**???:**
Fwahahaha!
Welcome, mongrels!

 
**Mash:**
Th-This voice!

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
It is I, Toyotomi Gilyoshi! King of Heroes and ruler of Zipangu, the Land of Gold!

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
All the treasures of this world, be they gold, or really nice tea sets, are all mine, hah!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Man, this situation is really getting out of hand. “Hah?”

 
**Demon Archer:**
Hmm... He kind of reminds me of Monkey.

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
Don't be mistaken, mongrels. This amount of mud won't even shake my being! I'm here on a different matter!

 
**Mash:**
A different matter?

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
I won't allow you to forget! I'm speaking of the time I bestowed treasures upon you! I offered you the finest gifts...

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
...yet you mongrels greedily said how Rome's was better, or how you wanted the Dark ones!

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
I wanted those too!
I... I suffered too... I suffered greatly.

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
Why... Why didn't anyone... come to my 10 Summons...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He said it wasn't going to shake his being, but things have become disappointing for the King of Heroes.

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
I won't give up. Some things are beautiful because you don't own them. Heh, that's the healthy way to look at it.

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
Now I build my power to prepare for the next event.

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
I'm gathering gold and plain tea sets from this country,
so that next time I can show people who the true king is!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Man, this is... Yeah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Give me a 5-star next time!
 

 
**Mash:**
Calm down Senpai!
I don't know what the King of Heroes is talking about...

 
**Mash:**
...But since he seems like the last boss, let's defeat him and go home to sleep!

 
**Mash:**
To be honest, I'm getting tired.
In more ways than one!

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
Hmph. I am the sun itself, yet you point your blade at me, mongrel? Very well, Hanbei, Kanbei. Give me a plan!

 
**Takenaka Andersen:**
I ain't got one, moron.
What's with this low-quality world setting!

 
**Takenaka Andersen:**
It doesn't make any sense!
I told them not to make a 2D show into a 3D movie!

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
Such a shame! Such an awful, terrible shame!
But, this is a rare chance, right?

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
In Asia we say, “Dance or explode, fellow idiots!”
So let's take this chance to go boom!

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
Huh? Have I not been showing up as often lately?
Aww, you're kidding me!

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
Don't you think Christmas Mephisto might just have a shot of happening?

 
**Mash:**
No, I do not!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
I can't believe I lost...
My body falls and disappears with the dew...

 
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**
Uruk is just a dream within a dream...
Act now to...become an Uruk citizen... (dies)

 
**Takenaka Andersen:**
Okay, we're done.
Now my role is finished here.

 
**Takenaka Andersen:**
I liked the sound of “Takenaka Andersen” so I played along, but I'm sick of that laughing idiot's voice.

 
**Takenaka Andersen:**
This whole Japan setting is bad news, anyway.
I might run into some crazy nun at any moment.

 
**Takenaka Andersen:**
Make sure you guys don't do this too much, okay?
These marathons are best if you don't do them for too long.

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
A shame! A disappointment!
Still, the famed fairy tale author sure is nice, huh?

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
I'm not exactly sure who was talking there, but I'll offer you this tea pot as a present.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you very kindly...

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
The simple and subdued culture of the Far East fascinates me! Exploding tea pots! How eccentric!

 
**Kuroda Mephisto:**
Let's all count down together!
Three, two, one!

 
**Mash:**
What? This explodes?
Wh-What do we do Senpai?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get down!
 
**Mash:**
Right! Senpai, hurry and get behind my shield!
Hold me close! As close as you can!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Throw it away!
 
**Mash:**
R-Right! I will throw this as far as I, Mash Kyrielight, possibly can!

 

 
**Demon Archer:**
Don't worry, only Matsunaga's teapot explodes. Yoink!
...Yep, seems it's the core of that transformed Grail.

 
**Demon Archer:**
Now my power will return, and we'll be all set...

 
**Mash:**
Huh?
Archer?

 
**Okita Souji:**
Archer...
You can't be!

 
**Demon Archer?:**
Indeed...
Everything is according to keikaku...

 
## Final Act: Up in Flames!! GUDAGUDA Honnoji
 
**Demon Archer:**
Fwahahahaha!
I commend you for your efforts!

 
**Demon Archer:**
Everything is according to keikaku!
This whole thing was my idea!

 
**Demon Archer:**
Twelve Servant sacrifices to the Grail!
I've regained my power!

 
**Demon Archer:**
I'll use the power of the Grail to make this space mine,
and then make my way to your world!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You tricked us!?
 
**Mash:**
No way! I mean, I kind of saw it coming?

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Now I shall reveal my True Name!
I am Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, we knew that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nobbu, why...
 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Indeed, I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobu&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Oh, we knew that.

 

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Huh? How did you know?

 
**Okita Souji:**
You introduced yourself during lunch, even though nobody asked you.

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Huh? What was I doing?

 
**???:**
Hah! You've shown yourself, then!

 
**Mash:**
This voice!

 
**Oda Nobunaga :**
That's right, it's me!

 
**Mash:**
Two... Nobunagas?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This mess has reached its peak.
 

 
**E：Oda Nobunaga:**
Actually, I went to the bathroom after lunch,
and someone attacked me from behind!

 
**E：Oda Nobunaga:**
The next thing I knew I was tied up behind the bathroom, but I managed to escape.

 
**E：Oda Nobunaga:**
In other words, the person that's been with you since lunch is a fake!

 
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**
Damn you, you're just half of me yet you're so persistent! My plan was to defeat the real me so I can become the real me!

 
**Okita Souji:**
I see.
Thanks for the explanation.

 
**Okita Souji:**
I think I understand, but I'm still not sure who's talking.

 
**Mash:**
Why don't we just call them Good Nobbu and Bad Nobbu, so we can tell who's who?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, that might be a good idea...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can I just tap SKIP?
 

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
What? It's not fair to call me the bad one!
I'm the same as her!

 
**Good Nobbu:**
I win! I'm the good Nobbu!
I have finally unified this nation by force!

 
**Good Nobbu:**
The battle's as good as won!
Surrender, Bad Nobbu!

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
Don't be a goody-goody!
I come from you, so you're Bad Nobbu too!

 
**Good Nobbu:**
No way! You left me, so now I'm 100% Good Nobbu!

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
Curse you! You can't talk your way out of this, Good Nobbu! You're definitely worse than me!

 
**Good Nobbu:**
BZZT! Wrong! I can't believe how dumb and bad I am.

 
**Okita Souji:**
Could both of you shut up, please?

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
Fine, I'll show you what makes Bad Nobbu so good at being bad!

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
No matter how well Good Nobbu talks, I've got most of the power!

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
Now&mdash;I shall burn the world and its gods to ash!
For I am Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
FWAHAHAHAHA!
Kneel before the power that slays even gods!

 
**Good Nobbu:**
Damn you, Bad Nobbu! Everyone!
Band together and help me defeat my evil side!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yay! Last battle time!
 
**Okita Souji:**
Yes! I'm starting to run low on magical energy and could disappear at any moment, so I'm glad.

 
**Good Nobbu:**
Your body's way too weak!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is there a way to defeat both of them?
 
**Okita Souji:**
What? I never thought of that.
That's perfect! Brilliant!

 
**Good & Bad Nobbu:**
Huh?

 

 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway, let's just beat the bad Nobunaga!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Bad Nobbu:**
D-Damn you, Good Nobbu...
But I have not lost to you!

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
I lost to the good Nobbu that's inside my heart!
I will appear again... Yes...

 
**Bad Nobbu:**
When you forget to be grateful to the land for its blessings!

 
**Mash:**
She said something ominous and disappeared.
I suppose that means mission complete?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Let's go home.
 
**Mash:**
We picked up many tea sets along the way.
I'm sure that will make Da Vinci happy.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That felt like forever.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, it was long in a lot of ways...
Oh, we need to take back all these tea sets.

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, looks like this space is starting to fall apart.
Be careful on your way back.

 
**Oda Nobunaga (Real):**
Hmmm, my power has fully returned, it seems.

 
**Oda Nobunaga (Real):**
...Fwahahaha!
Now I'm really, really done with you...

 
**Okita Souji:**
I'm sure we've had enough of that.

 
**Okita Souji:**
Oh, everyone, thank you for your help.
Next time, please come visit us in our world.

 
**Okita Souji:**
We're in the middle of a big war, though.

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Indeed, our worlds were not meant to intertwine,
but I've taken a liking to you!

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
If you ever summon me, the power of the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven shall be at your disposal!

 
**Okita Souji:**
Yes, but that probability is most likely very low...

 
**Okita Souji:**
...But if it ever happens, Fujimaru,
I shall lend you my blade!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, thanks!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Summon... Probability... Ugh, my head...
 

 
**Mash:**
Goodbye Okita, Nobunaga!
The takuan we had for lunch was delicious!

 
**Okita Souji:**
Hehe, I hope we meet again someday!

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Yes, it wasn't for long, but you commanded well.
Goodbye, Fujimaru! Farewell!

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;That was pretty rough, huh, Senpai?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It felt like it was a dream.
 
**Mash:**
What do you think they're doing now?

 
**Mash:**
I'm curious what happened to the Imperial Holy Grail, too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, it was such a mess.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I'm glad I didn't turn into a weird creature and go...

 
**Mash:**
Mash-Mash!

 
**Mash:**
Like they did.

 

 
**Mash:**
What's this?

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Hey! How've you guys been?

 
**Mash:**
Nobunaga?

 
**Okita Souji:**
It's been a while, everyone.
This time, my evil heart has gone out of control...

 
**Mash:**
Leave!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Give me a break...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a mess until the very end...
 

 
**Okita Souji:**
I'm really sorry for everything.

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
It can't be helped!
