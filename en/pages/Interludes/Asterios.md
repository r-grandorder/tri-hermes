# Asterios

<h2>This Hand, For You</h2>

**Asterios:**
Um. Master.
Hello.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hello...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good morning...
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
I am glad.
Mash, Master, awake.

 
**Mash:**
Oh Master, are you all right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What happened?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure, but it seems we are lost inside this labyrinth.

 
**Mash:**
Communication with the Doctor has been cut off as well.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Fortunately, Asterios and Fou are with us.

 
**Asterios:**
Fou...this...cookie...want...to...eat?

 
**Fou:**
Munch, munch.

 
**Asterios:**
Good boy.
Good boy.

 
**Mash:**
It appears unless we get out of this labyrinth,
we won't be able to contact anyone.

 
**Asterios:**
I will...go...ahead.
Everyone...get out...of here.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, let's go!

 
**Mash:**
It certainly is dark...

 
**Asterios:**
Master...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes?
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
Sorry.
It was...nothing.

 
**Asterios:**
...Wait.
I smell...something...strange.

 
**Mash:**
...I can faintly smell...

 
**Asterios:**
The smell...of blood.

 
**Asterios:**
...Master, stand back.
I...Asterios...will defeat them!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Asterios:**
Whew.
Is everyone...all right?

 
**Mash:**
Both Fou and Master are just fine.
How are you, Asterios?

 
**Asterios:**
No problem.
Continue.

 
**Mash:**
It sure is far.
It seems like this place goes on forever...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Asterios:**
Master, are you ok?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm still fine.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll be all right.
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
Are you sure?
Don't...push yourself.

 
**Mash:**
He's right. Please don't force yourself.
For now, let's just walk a bit longer.

 
**Asterios:**
...Hmm.
I knew it...

 
**Mash:**
What's the matter?

 
**Asterios:**
Here...turn left.

 
**Mash:**
Do you know the way?

 
**Asterios:**
Yes. Used to it. This...labyrinth...
I...grew up...here.

 
**Mash:**
In the Labyrinth?
I-I thought this place looked familiar...

 
**Asterios:**
So...I know...the exit.
But...

 
**Mash:**
But what?

 
**Asterios:**
...We cannot avoid...being attacked.

 
**Mash:**
There are more enemies.
Master, orders please.

 
**Asterios:**
Lead us...Master.
I will...fight!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Asterios:**
Master...tired?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A little...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes.
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
Master...if all right...
I know...it's not.

 
**Asterios:**
But...hold my hand?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Would it be ok with you?
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
You don't mind...I don't mind.
Yes. This...is good.

 
**Mash:**
Is everything all right, Asterios?

 
**Asterios:**
Why?

 
**Mash:**
Well, it's just that, instead of going up we are going deeper and deeper.

 
**Asterios:**
Yes.
That is...correct.

 
**Mash:**
I see...

 
**Asterios:**
...Excuse me...Master.
Master...afraid...of me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why would I be?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's there to be afraid of?
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
...If not afraid...then it's fine.
I am...glad.

 
**Asterios:**
That...voice...

 
**Mash:**
Asterios?

 
**Child:**
Stop, I am scared...
Please stop!

 
**Child:**
Help...me...

 
**???:**
...Heeheeheeheehee!
Tasty, tasty, tasty.

 
**Mash:**
...Ugh!

 
**Asterios:**
Are...you...
Are you... Me?

 
**Asterios(?):**
Yes, I am.
Do I look like anything, else?

 
**Asterios:**
...Stop that.

 
**Asterios(?):**
But this is what you did.

 
**Asterios:**
...I did...this.
That's why...I am...ending this.

 
**Asterios(?):**
Hee, hee, hee.
What are you talking about.

 
**Asterios(?):**
You know, this is what you wished!
You wanted to eat, so you ate!

 
**Asterios(?):**
I am a Minotaur!
I am nothing else than that!

 
**Asterios:**
&ndash;I am...Asterios!

 
**Asterios:**
As long as...there are people...calling my name.
I will...continue to...reject you!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Asterios(?):**
Y. O. U...
You think you can reject "yourself?"

 
**Asterios(?):**
You know, it's worse than death.

 
**Asterios:**
I must... I must...reject myself. I reject everything about me... I throw away everything about me.

 
**Asterios:**
&ndash;That is...my...punishment.
&ndash;That is...my...atonement.

 
**Asterios:**
Master... Let's go...
The exit...is not far.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
May I hold your hand?
 


---
 
**Asterios:**
...Yes. Let us go.

 
**Narration:**
&ndash;Someday...I want to hold someone's hand.
&ndash;That's...what I thought.
