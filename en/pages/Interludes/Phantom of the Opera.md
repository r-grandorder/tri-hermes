# Phantom of the Opera

<h2>Christine's Call</h2>

**Phantom:**
Christine Oh, Christine, my love, my songstress&ndash;

 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne! Oh, Jeanne!
Oh, our blessed holy maiden!

 
**Phantom:**
To you who dozes, I sing with affection&ndash;

 
**Gilles:**
Let's pile our offerings high!
Of ridicule and blasphemy!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Who put these two together?
The speakers are howling because of them!

 
**Mash:**
This entire underground passage is also like that...
The echo is just awful. How can you stand it?

 
**Phantom:**
Sing once again with me, once again Christine, Christine, my songstress 
 
**Gilles:**
Everyone is an equal servant before God! Okay,
let's desecrate together! Hohoho! Hohohohohoho!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Shut up!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Christine!
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Foou, Foou!
Kyuu...uh...

 
**Mash:**
Ah, ahh, Senpai! Fou is getting weaker and weaker...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What is it? I don't feel great, either...
Mental Corruption skills aren't contagious, right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Today we have double the Mental Corruption skills, so it feels like it's spreading.

 
**Mash:**
That's a problem.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's just take care of this.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I just want to go home.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai... If we go to the deepest point in this underground passage...

 
**Mash:**
I'm sure Phantom will be satisfied.
He said it'd be good just to come here.

 
**Fou:**
Kyuu...u...uu...
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
Fou, a-are you all right&ndash;You aren't!
What should we do, Senpai? A-At this rate...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's quite strong, you know.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(To Fou) How about it?
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, Foou!
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
Have confidence...
Does that mean, well, that you can...keep going?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
...Got it.
If you insist, Fou, I will do my best, too!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Foou!

 
**Mash:**
Okay... Well, both of you! Your feelings for loved ones are conveyed so move along!

 
**Mash:**
Let's hurry!
You have some business ahead, right, Phantom?

 
**Phantom:**
Christine&ndash;

 
**Gilles:**
Oh, Jeanne&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Well&ndash;

 
**Phantom:**
Christine, Christine 
 
**Gilles:**
Oh, Jeanne!
Beloved holy maiden!

 
**Mash:**
Ehh, can you hear me?
You know, you don't have to keep stopping...

 
**Phantom:**
Christine, Christine Christine, Christine 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Phantom:**
Christine, Christine, Christine Christine, Christine, Christine 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!

 
**Mash:**
...

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, please calm down.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're looking at them like they're the enemy?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup, definitely an enemy!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You too, Doctor!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Indeed, they both look like Anti-Heroes.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What are you talking about, Fujimaru?
No, that's not it.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Magical energy response detected!
It's continually rising from the depths. Be careful!

 
**Mash:**
...Yes.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are you, ahh, angry...Mash?

 
**Mash:**
No.
Senpai, please give me an order.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're angry, aren't you?

 
**Mash:**
Order me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-Yes. Well, prepare for combat.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Will you...fight for me?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 
**???:**
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh&ndash;

 
**Phantom:**
Christine, Christine, Christine Christine, Christine, Christine 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!

 
**???:**
Ohhhhhhhh Ohhh&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy is losing against that pair's momentum!
Now!

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...The battle is over.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He was just making noise...
General Gilles didn't participate in the battle...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, was General Gilles among Fujimaru's contracted Heroic Spirits? I don't remember.

 
**Phantom:**
Let's go home.
Christine, you're not here anymore.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Had enough already?
You feel better?

 
**Phantom:**
Christine, my love, my songstress...
Where are you&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Perhaps he was looking for some traces of Christine, the songstress he loved in life, under Paris?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, it's a different era. Oh, maybe he can't even see that due to his Mental Corruption.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's kind of sad...if you think about it.
I can understand that loneliness&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Let's go home!
Please Rayshift us, Doctor.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I tried to force this story into a good ending.
Y-You're so heartless, Mash.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you still angry?
 
**Mash:**
No, Senpai.
I'm not angry.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
L-Let's go home!
 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, let's go home then! Yup, yup!
But wait, where did General Gilles go?


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Gilles:**
Oh, How disgraceful man's greed is!
So much vice in this darkness&ndash;hmm?

 
**Fou:**
Fo...Fou (weakened)

 
**Gilles:**
What an adorable little animal!
Suitably adorable for sacrifice to the altar of blasphemy!

 
**Fou:**
Fo...u... (weakened)

 
**Gilles:**
What a coincidence that you're shaking in this darkness.
I'm also like a beast betrayed by all, shaking in darkness.

 
**Gilles:**
Now, let us go together.
It's warm under this cloak, you see.

 
**Fou:**
...(weakened)

 
**Gilles:**
Hohohoho, it's so adorable!
Oh, oh, it's shaking, shaking!

 
**Fou:**
...(weakened)
