<h2>You Are a Monster</h2>


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Something's touching my cheek...)


---
 
**Narration:**
I felt something that was both cold and warm...
Something between hard and soft...

 
**Narration:**
It felt...rough...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Something is grasping my finger...)


---
 
**Narration:**
It felt like a bottomless chasm...just waiting to swallow me whole...

 
**Narration:**
It felt damp...

 
**???:**
How boring...

 
**???:**
Ah, now it's crying out saying it can wait no longer. My hair...my evil...is shamelessly driveling...

 
**???:**
If you do not wake up soon,
I may really eat you...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(WHA...!?!?!?)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Where am I...?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
...Hmph. So you have awoken.
That was a close call for you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There are scale marks on my cheek!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's a snake chewing on my finger!?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
If you're disappointed that I spared your life rather than relieved...

 
**Gorgon:**
...then tell me that you lament having missed the opportunity to merge with me and melt into sweet oblivion.

 
**Gorgon:**
It's not too late to speak up.
Don't you fret. I am always hungry.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, no, no, no...no. Don't worry about me.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, uh, thanks, but I'm...fine...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Mmm. What...is this place?

 
**Gorgon:**
I just found myself here with you sleeping beside me. You're my Master. Do you know what is happening?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This has happened to me a few times...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Probably a dream, or your unconscious or something...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
...? What do you mean? Explain more in detail.

 
**Gorgon:**
Hehe...hahahaha!
A dream. A dream? Of mine!? Oh you ARE funny...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's...funny?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Of course it is. Look around you.
See this cold, empty world.

 
**Gorgon:**
It's so dark... Not a mote of light to be seen,
nor a sign of life anywhere.

 
**Gorgon:**
Your lungs are filled with dark and ominous air.
What dread sights you can see are most sinister.

 
**Gorgon:**
The cold floor is damp, like a demon's entrails,
and eagerly awaits you to collapse and die...

 
**Gorgon:**
Its hideous walls stifle you,
waiting to close around you like a coffin.

 
**Gorgon:**
There is nothing at all good here. A true nightmare for any human. A being of pure despair and evil...that is what I am.

 
**Gorgon:**
Ah... This place is a true reflection of my nature...utterly monstrous!

 
**Gorgon:**
I certainly could not argue if you said this was a reflection of who I am within. All I can do is laugh at this! Hahahaha!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're talking nonsense again...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe there's a field of flowers over there...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
... I've always wondered.
What do you think of me, truly?

 
**Gorgon:**
Now more than ever, you fail to understand my nature, which makes this a good opportunity to teach you.

 
**Gorgon:**
I am...evil. That is all.

 
**Gorgon:**
The third sister of a certain family, destined to become a monster. That is all I am.

 
**Gorgon:**
As my power goes beyond any mere common evil,
some may even call me the mother of Demonic Beasts.

 
**Gorgon:**
Yet you do not fear me... Why?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We don't have any trouble communicating...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You seem to understand what I say...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
...If communication is all you require, your bar is quite...low.

 
**Gorgon:**
And even that is only possible because, at this moment, I exist in a state between my forms as a goddess and monster.

 
**Gorgon:**
I honestly do not understand why I was summoned in this state...

 
**Gorgon:**
Let me make myself clear. I am not a goddess.
I am a monster. I am a divinity who turned evil.

 
**Gorgon:**
That's why you&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's that voice!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something's coming!


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Hah... I am the mother of Demonic Beasts. I devour even other evils. It would not surprise me to know there are a few lurking within me.

 
**Gorgon:**
At least it may be amusing to watch whatever hungry beasts lurk here devour you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me out...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Shut up. I don't care what you want.

 
**Gorgon:**
But... I have no intention of feeding the other evils that work within me in this dream of mine.

 
**Gorgon:**
Letting them feast on your flesh would be a waste.
Besides, I happen to feel like exercising just now.

 
**Gorgon:**
Consider yourself lucky.
You can cower before me once we finish here.

 
**Gorgon:**
Now, look upon my form and learn...

 
**Gorgon:**
Learn that the being you thought you could merely talk with is a monster who will turn your stomach!

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Gorgon:**
Hahaha...what do you think!?
Did you see my terrible serpent form!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks! You saved me!


---
 
**Gorgon:**
That's not what I'm talking about!
That's not what you should be saying!

 
**Gorgon:**
You should be terrified! You should be soiling yourself! You should be begging me not to eat you!

 
**Gorgon:**
This is the time to beg for your life!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, I'm thinking leaving would be a good idea...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think we should stay long...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Ungh...
This human...is unbelievable...!

 
**Gorgon:**
Argh! Fine! So!?
Do you have any idea how to escape!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't, but let's just keep going.


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Hmph. Are you saying we should simply head in that direction?

 
**Gorgon:**
The single, obvious way out in a place steeped in nothing but evil on all sides?

 
**Gorgon:**
I suspect that will only lead us to a hell far worse than the one we find ourselves in now.

 
**Gorgon:**
But you willingly walk headlong into peril...and you are even willing to peek into the underbelly of the hideous monster I am?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sure there are parts of yourself you don't want anyone seeing...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We've got to go that way to get out, sorry.


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Silence. It seems you value neither your life nor your sanity.

 
**Gorgon:**
Perhaps you will realize what they were worth once you've lost them. Hehe.

 
**Gorgon:**
Very well. I'm intrigued.

 
**Gorgon:**
I shall watch your final moments and mock them to the very end. You may meet your end without fear. Hahaha.

 
**Gorgon:**
...Hold it right there. Are you a fool?

 
**Gorgon:**
Did you not think that carelessly venturing out might mean your death? If you simply perished, I would be robbed of my chance to watch a demon devour you.

 
**Gorgon:**
Just stand behind me and follow me, scum.
Unbelievable...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She might get angry again if I thank her...)


---

**--ARROW--:**

**Gorgon:**
I can feel the evil presence growing stronger.
It certainly doesn't bother me, but you&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Tsk. You're fine? Disappointing. Do you have no consideration for how your whimpering and looks of terror would keep me entertained on this dull journey?

 
**Gorgon:**
Don't you know?
Human suffering is my greatest pleasure.

 
**Gorgon:**
Seeing, hearing, and tasting human suffering are my favorite things to do...

 
**Gorgon:**
That terror, oh it makes me drool in anticipation. There is no better seasoning for my meal.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that because...you're an Avenger?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
...What a silly thing to say.

 
**Gorgon:**
That class was forced upon me when I was summoned as a Servant.

 
**Gorgon:**
But...you're probably right.
Your absurd question jogged my memory.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Memory of what?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Rage!

 
**Gorgon:**
Yes...I may truly be an Avenger. The desire for revenge does indeed burn within my Spirit Origin.

 
**Gorgon:**
But...revenge against what?
Whatever is it that I hate so much?

 
**Gorgon:**
The unknown is what infuriates me, and it has led me to kill and devour all living things I encounter.

 
**Gorgon:**
That, at least, I find fulfilling, all the more so if the victim is someone I loathe.

 
**Gorgon:**
Heh...a monster who doesn't even know who deserves her vengeance...

 
**Gorgon:**
Of all the Heroic Spirits you employ,
I must be the most bizarre and horrible!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not true...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Tsk. I've said too much. Forget it.

 
**Gorgon:**
Either way, the stench of evil is getting stronger here. Something is bound to happ&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-it got dark all of a sudden!


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Quiet.

 
**Gorgon:**
Hmph. I can hardly see... Even my own eyes cannot see through...the darkness within me...

 
**Gorgon:**
... Fine. For now...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And something touched me!!!


---
 
**Gorgon:**
I said keep quiet. That's just my hair.
Hold on to it and don't let go.

 
**Gorgon:**
If you annoy it, it may bite off a finger or two.
If you want to live, deal with it. Let's go.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I hope she's only kidding...)


---
 
**Gorgon:**
... There's something up ahead...

 
**Gorgon:**
...! Is...that...

 
**Gorgon:**
My older sisters...

 
**Gorgon:**
And that's...

 
**Gorgon:**
Me!!!

 
**Gorgon:**
Wait. Stop. What are you doing?

 
**Gorgon:**
No...what are you...trying to show me!?

 
**Gorgon:**
...!

 
**Gorgon:**
...

 
**Gorgon:**
Ah, I see.

 
**Gorgon:**
So this is a dream to show me what might have been!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What was that...?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
...Let me ask you.
What did you just see?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh...I don't know, it was all fuzzy...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
I see. That's a relief.

 
**Gorgon:**
Even if you did see something or THINK you saw something, don't ask. I'll kill you if you do.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can still see the other Gorgon.


---
 
**???:**
...

 
**Gorgon:**
Hmph. I'll let that one slide.
That's only the “me” I see in my dreams.

 
**Gorgon:**
And that...that is... Hahaha!
All the more reason to kill it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're going to kill it!?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Of course. That being is the center of the evil that has flooded this realm. My body...my every instinct...cries out for that thing's blood!

 
**Gorgon:**
(Instinct...that's right...instinct.)

 
**Gorgon:**
(If that is true...)

 
**Gorgon:**
(Is that what defines my existence? Is that how I will end up? Is it telling me to seek revenge...)

 
**Gorgon:**
(...against the humans and world that led me here...?)

 
**Gorgon:**
(Hehe...hahaha!!!)

 
**Gorgon:**
(Who cares? Even if that were true,
my purpose does not change. I am not wrong.)

 
**Gorgon:**
(I devour what I wish. I kill what I wish.
That is the essence of my very being!)

 
**Gorgon:**
Ah, of course. Of course. In the end...this is all monsters are able to do!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gorgon:**
The darkness is starting to clear...
Hehehe... Oh, that was satisfying!

 
**Gorgon:**
And yet...that was no more than a shadow of my past and future. I know just how pointless it is.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
?


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Hah! That vacant look...
I can see you do not understand. But I do.

 
**Gorgon:**
What would you call something that is both satisfying and completely pointless?

 
**Gorgon:**
...Amusement.

 
**Gorgon:**
I had an amusing dream. If how I feel now is any indication...I would say it was a sweet dream.

 
**Gorgon:**
Let me reiterate: I am a monster.

 
**Gorgon:**
Killing that monster&ndash;that other me&ndash;and bathing in its blood was exhilarating. I found that dream...amusing.

 
**Gorgon:**
Knowing that...do you still want something like me in your Chaldea?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.


---
 
**Gorgon:**
Why? I've told you time and time again, and you still don't get it!? I am no Heroic Spirit! I AM A MONSTER!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whatever you are, you are here now.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You answered my call...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
...You are mistaken.

 
**Gorgon:**
Even I do not know why I was summoned.
It must have been some kind of accident.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even if it's an accident or a mistake, I'm happy.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you for coming to Chaldea.


---
 
**Gorgon:**
I said...you...!

 
**Gorgon:**
(Sigh) So annoying.
Even my hunger has dissipated.

 
**Gorgon:**
...Hmph. It's almost time to wake up.
I failed to devour the moron before me.

 
**Gorgon:**
...

 
**Gorgon:**
Perhaps it is the same for humans, but I will likely forget this most amusing dream of mine.

 
**Gorgon:**
And if you don't want me to remember that I failed to devour you...

 
**Gorgon:**
Do not ever mention what happened in this dream should you recall it. For your own safety.

 
**Gorgon:**
Hmph.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh.


---
 
**Mash:**
What's wrong, Senpai?

 
**Gorgon:**
...! (Silent pressure)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...


---
 
**Gorgon:**
... (Look that says, “Good. Keep quiet.”)

 
**Mash:**
...?

 
**Stheno:**
Very suspicious, don't you think, “me?”

 
**Euryale:**
Yes. They were exchanging knowing glances with each other, “me.”

 
**Stheno:**
Hehe...our foolish younger sister, who's three times the size of the one we're used to seeing...the BBB (Big Big Big) Mountain...

 
**Stheno:**
What in the world do you think transpired between her and Master last night? I am so curious.

 
**Euryale:**
Yes. We must pry it out of her...down to the last juicy detail.

 
**Euryale:**
Privacy? What's that?
We had no such thing on our island.

 
**Gorgon:**
Older sisters...!?

 
**Stheno & Euryale:**
Fess up. Right now.
Come on...hurry up...spill it...!

 
**Gorgon:**
M-Master! Remember that we had planned a training session in the simulator!?

 
**Gorgon:**
Let's get going! It's important! If I don't get exercise, I'll get rusty! Now, please excuse us!

 
**Stheno:**
She's fleeing with Master! Does that mean something really...is there some truth behind what we think happened between them!?

 
**Euryale:**
Hold it right there! Do you think you can get away with keeping secrets from your older sisters!? You big, giant fool of a sister! Wait up!

 
**Mash:**
Wh-what just happened?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!
