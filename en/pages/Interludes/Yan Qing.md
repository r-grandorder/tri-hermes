# Yan Qing

<h2>A Certain Chivalrous Man's Death</h2>

**Narration:**
...It crosses everyone's mind at one point or another.

 
**Narration:**
Am I really me? How do I know I'm not actually someone else's puppet?

 
**Narration:**
Maybe this world is fake, and I'm just a brain in a jar imagining the whole thing...

 
**Narration:**
Maybe I don't actually exist.

 
**Narration:**
My Legends... My Myths...
Those exist. I wonder why...

 
**Narration:**
...Who am I?

 
**Yan Qing:**
(Gasp, gasp, gasp)...

 
**Narration:**
The sky is muddied and dirty.
Even the water tastes foul.

 
**Narration:**
The scent of blood is everywhere.
Everything about this place is terrible.

 
**Narration:**
The bleeding won't stop.
There's nowhere left I can run.

 
**???:**
How does it feel to die?

 
**Yan Qing:**
...It sucks.

 
**Narration:**
I keep smiling, grinning, sneering,
like I don't give a damn.

 
**Narration:**
But even though this is the end for me, the same familiar doubt nags at the back of my mind.

 
**Narration:**
And when you get right down to it, I spend my entire life asking myself the same question.

 
**Narration:**
Who was I, really?

 
**Narration:**
I wonder if this guy has the answer.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Hey, do you know who I was?

 
**???:**
...
...

 
**???:**
You were&ndash;

 
**Narration:**
But before he could finish,
I closed my eyes and drifted off.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Never thought I'd end up back in Shinjuku...


---
 
**Mash:**
Our connection is holding strong, Master.
Let's go over the situation one more time.

 
**Mash:**
The Shinjuku Singularity has already been repaired.

 
**Mash:**
So no matter what might be going on here,
it won't have any effect on humanity...

 
**Mash:**
Still, we don't know why a single Servant decided to Rayshift here.

 
**Mash:**
The Assassin of Shinjuku. True Name: Yan Qing...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wonder what's going on with him.
 
**Mash:**
I'm afraid all we know right now is that he Rayshifted here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're sure he came to Shinjuku?
 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 
**Mash:**
We were tracking his Spirit Origin up till he disappeared here.

 
**Mash:**
However, there were some, um, irregularities with the tracking data, so I don't know if we can trust it entirely.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Hassan of the Cursed Arm and Geronimo have come along to serve as your guides.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you both for doing this.

 
**Geronimo:**
I am pleased to be here.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Well Master, where shall we begin our search?

 
**Geronimo:**
We'll never find him without a plan. I think our only option is to follow his magical energy.

 
**Mash:**
I agree. And we do have tracking data that should help us with that.

 
**Mash:**
The problem is that Yan Qing's trail went cold here.

 
**Mash:**
Maybe he interfered with our observational equipment somehow, or maybe...

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Yes. He may have been injured or killed.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Oh, sorry, my apologies.
Worry not, [♂ Lord /♀️ Lady} Fujimaru.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Lord Yan Qing is as tough as they come.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
What's more, I imagine he feels especially at home in an urban setting like this. He will not die easily.

 
**Geronimo:**
Indeed. I don't even need to read his fortune to assure you that he is alive and well.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
All right, I'll begin by searching the perimeter.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Once I have the lay of the land,
we can begin a thorough investigation.

 
**Geronimo:**
Very well then, we'll wait here until you return.

 
**Geronimo:**
I would like to resolve this quickly,
given Master's physical limitations.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Haha, a good point.
Then I will be back as soon as I can.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
See you later!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful out there!
 
**Cursed Arm:**
You are too kind, Master. But worry not. We Hassans blend into shadows as naturally as breathing.

 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
All right, let's wait and see how&ndash;

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I found him.

 
**Geronimo:**
Wha...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Already!?


---
 
**Yan Qing:**
Yo, lady!

 
**Yan Qing:**
Can I get one of those mystery meat buns?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Thanks.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep, that's him...
 
**Cursed Arm:**
I could hardly believe my eyes.
I've never seen such a lazy Assassin.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's he doing here?
 
**Geronimo:**
...We will just have to ask him once we've caught him.

 


---
 
**Yan Qing:**
Oh, hey Master.
What's up?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's what I wanna know!


---
 
**Yan Qing:**
?

 
**Yan Qing:**
...Oh, yeah, right.
Guess I kinda left without saying anything, huh.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Sorry about that. And I'm sorry about this, too...

 
**Yan Qing:**
...but there's something I gotta do here,
and I'm not leaving till it's done.

 
**A：Yan Qing (?):**
So I'm afraid I can't let you bring me back!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're using your doppelgänger power!?
 
**A：Yan Qing (?):**
You know it.

 
**A：Yan Qing (?):**
I can't let myself be caught, no matter what!
So you better believe I'm pulling out all the stops!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He transformed!
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hmm, this could be a problem.
Now, what to do about it...

 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
It would seem he's quite desperate.
In that case...

 
**Geronimo:**
...the only way he'll listen to reason is if we knock some into him. Let's do this, Master.

 
**Mash:**
Okay everyone, prepare for combat!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Yan Qing (?):**
Sorry, the answer's still no.
Later!

 
**Geronimo:**
A smoke bomb...!

 
**Cursed Arm:**
He must have taken it from someone while we were fighting.

 
**Mash:**
N-now what do we do?

 
**Mash:**
He did say there was something he had to do here...

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...We can't let him do it, whatever it may be.
Let's go after him, [♂ Lord /♀️ Lady} Fujimaru.

 
**Geronimo:**
Oh? Does that mean you know what Yan Qing is up to, Cursed Arm?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I do, for it concerns me personally.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Now, let us be on our way.
We may not know what that way is yet, but no matter.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
We will just have to keep looking until we find it.
For a Hassan, it is, as they say, business as usual.


**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
I don't mind roaming around looking for what I have to do. That irredeemable thing I can't just wipe off my slate.

 
**Narration:**
If someone tries to stop me, I'll eliminate them.
After all, I know I'm doing the right thing.

 
**Narration:**
To get my chance at being a good person...I'll take my revenge on him.

 
**Geronimo:**
Going after Yan Qing is all well and good...

 
**Geronimo:**
...but how are we going to find him when he could be anyone here?

 
**Geronimo:**
Any ideas?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Yes, actually. I snuck a cursed scent mark onto him during our battle.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
It has been passed down our clan for generations,
and should let me know when I'm drawing near him.

 
**Geronimo:**
Oho, you don't say. Quite clever.

 
**Geronimo:**
In that case, Cursed Arm,
I think it's best if you lead the way.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Is that all right with you, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Absolutely!


---
 
**Cursed Arm:**
...Hmm. It's faint, but I can smell the scent nearby.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
We may have tracked him down sooner than I thought.
Come, this way.

 
**Geronimo:**
In the meantime, let's think about what Yan Qing may have meant earlier.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean?
 
**Geronimo:**
I mean the thing he said he needs to do.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The thing he said he needs to do?
 
**Geronimo:**
That's right.

 
**Geronimo:**
What does he hope to accomplish by coming back to Shinjuku?

 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
What do you know about this, Cursed Arm?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...Hmm.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I'd rather not discuss it, but under the circumstances, I suppose I can share.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
You see, Lord Yan Qing actually came to apologize to me once, back when we were still at Chaldea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean, about what happened in Shinjuku?
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Indeed. You have an excellent memory, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about?
 
**Cursed Arm:**
The incident in Shinjuku, most likely.

 


---
 
**Yan Qing:**
'Sup, Cursed Arm. Got a minute?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Why, if it isn't Lord Yan Qing.
What brings you to my humble room?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Uh, I just wanted to say I was sorry.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Sorry...? If you've done something to wrong me,
I can't say I'm aware of it.

 
**Yan Qing:**
It sounds like I did you a real disservice back in Shinjuku, so, you know.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...Now I see. Yes, I do recall reading about that in the Shinjuku report.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I looked it over after I heard my name was mentioned, and there is nothing for you to apologize for.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Spies like us are quite used to disguises and betrayal. It all comes with the territory.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Yeah, maybe. And honestly,
I don't even remember doing it.

 
**Yan Qing:**
But there's this little voice in my Spirit Origin that keeps nagging at me.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Says I'll never be able to move on if I don't apologize to you first.

 
**Yan Qing:**
And that, if possible...I need to go back to Shinjuku and finish what I started.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Finish what you started...?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Yup. You know what they say...

 
**Yan Qing:**
If you commit the crime, you gotta do the time.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...But, have you not already done your “time” by fighting alongside Master?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I see no reason why you need to seek further redemption in Shinjuku.

 
**Yan Qing:**
...Yeah, true. Fair point.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Now that I think about, I feel pretty damn silly!
Just forget I said anything, all right?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...

 
**Cursed Arm:**
He never brought it up again after that,
so I never chose to pursue it further...

 
**Cursed Arm:**
But now that we're here, I'm reminded of how empty his smile seemed back then.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I think Lord Yan Qing is still trying to make amends.

 
**Geronimo:**
Amends, huh.

 
**Geronimo:**
However, whatever the Assassin of Shinjuku may have done here, it has nothing to do with Yan Qing.

 
**Geronimo:**
No, I'll go further: it would be wrong if it did. That would mean the sins we commit would pile higher and higher every time we were summoned.

 
**Geronimo:**
The heroes from the Age of Gods may be able to endure such a burden, but that is far too much for an ordinary person.

 
**Geronimo:**
That is why our actions are recorded independent of our memories.

 
**Mash:**
As a Demi-Servant myself,
I don't have any of his memories...

 
**Mash:**
...but if I did, I agree that the mental burden of such a thing would be overwhelming.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But, Yan Qing's...


---
 
**Cursed Arm:**
...No more talk. We've found him.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
That Hornet over there is Lord Yan Qing.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yan Qing!


---
 
**Yan Qing (?):**
Aw crap, you already found me!?

 
**Geronimo:**
Yan Qing.
Are you here to seek redemption?

 
**Geronimo:**
Or perhaps, retribution for your sins?

 
**E：Yan Qing:**
...It's not a matter of seeking it out, Geronimo.
I HAVE to be punished for what I did.

 
**E：Yan Qing:**
Otherwise, I won't be me anymore.

 
**Narration:**
...My head is pounding.

 
**Narration:**
These upstanding Heroic Spirit types don't know what it's like to live with this kind of pain in your soul.

 
**Narration:**
Just getting killed off isn't nearly enough.
I need to die in misery and agony.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yan Qing...?


---
 
**E：Yan Qing:**
...Please just let me do this, Master.
Please... I'm begging you.

 
**E：Yan Qing:**
I have to die for what I did.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I'm afraid that is a crude and contradictory way of seeing things, Yan Qing.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
You fight to take on sins that can only be paid for with your own life... That is a manner of thinking with which I am all too familiar.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
But you are woefully wet behind the ears if your only concern is wiping your regrets away, as mine once was.

 
**E：Yan Qing:**
...!

 
**Cursed Arm:**
What would you have us do, Master?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
If you are willing to accept his sins,
we can return to Chaldea right now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't think that's a good idea.
 
**Cursed Arm:**
...Hehe, I see.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's just talk about this, okay?
 
**E：Yan Qing:**
Sorry, but I really don't have time to talk!

 


---
 
**E：Yan Qing:**
...Dammit, I shoulda known it'd come to this.

 
**E：Yan Qing (?):**
Sorry, Master, but if this is how it's gonna be,
I'm not gonna make it easy for you!

 
**Geronimo:**
Hmm, I see has no small skill in multiplying himself.

 
**Mash:**
Um, I think he just called in reinforcements...

 
**Mash:**
Ahem.
At any rate, entering combat mode...now!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Geronimo:**
He must have run off while we were fighting the other Hornets.

 
**Geronimo:**
Still... Hmm.
Are you sure about this, Cursed Arm?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
About what?

 
**Geronimo:**
Are we truly doing the right thing here?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...Of course. That is why I came here, after all.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are you talking about?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait. You don't mean...


---
 
**Cursed Arm:**
I will explain the next time we encounter Yan Qing.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
He needs to hear this just as much as you do.


**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
...Where is he?

 
**Narration:**
He's not here.

 
**Narration:**
He's not anywhere.

 
**Narration:**
That can't be right.
He's GOTTA be here.

 
**Narration:**
He's just gotta be.

 
**Narration:**
Oh man, my body's falling apart.
I can't maintain my Yan Qing Spirit Origin.

 
**Narration:**
The sky is muddied and dirty.
Even the water tastes foul.

 
**???:**
How does it feel to die?

 
**Narration:**
I turn around, and see Death standing there waiting for me.

 
**Yan Qing:**
There you are. I knew I'd find you here,
Hassan of the Cursed Arm.

 
**Yan Qing:**
That's right. You're the one I've gotta apologize to. You're the one I killed.

 
**Yan Qing:**
No... That's not right. You killed me.

 
**Yan Qing:**
...No, wait. Please, wait. My head...my memories are all a mess... I can't tell what's true or not!

 
**Cursed Arm (?):**
Enough of this.
It's time you accepted your fate.

 
**Cursed Arm (?):**
...
...

 
**Cursed Arm (?):**
We can't ever atone for our sins.

 
**Yan Qing:**
...That voice...
No, wait...

 
**Yan Qing:**
Are you me?

 
**Cursed Arm (?):**
Let me answer your question with one of my own.

 
**Cursed Arm (?):**
Who do you think you are?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hassan wasn't Hassan...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yan Qing...!?


---
 
**C：Yan Qing:**
Hey there, Master!
Sorry 'bout this!

 
**C：Yan Qing:**
I definitely meant to trick you,
but not like this!

 
**Geronimo:**
Hmm. It would seem you are the real Yan Qing.

 
**Geronimo:**
And yet, your Spirit Origin is indistinguishable from this Yan Qing.

 
**Geronimo:**
...That can only mean one thing.

 
**Geronimo:**
The other Yan Qing is a doppelgänger.

 
**A：Yan Qing (?):**
Ah...
A-ah...

 
**E：Yan Qing (?):**
Aaahhh!

 
**C：Yan Qing:**
Whoa, whoa, calm down, other me! Ah crap.
I knew it was too soon to pull back the curtains!

 
**Mash:**
Is that...a Servant? No, now they're...Christine?
And Hassan, and Yan Qing...

 
**Mash:**
They keep transforming into all sorts of different enemies!

 
**C：Yan Qing:**
It doesn't matter who he turns into.
We just gotta get him to calm down, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean beat him down.
 
**C：Yan Qing:**
You got it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, basically...
 
**C：Yan Qing:**
We hit him real hard!

 
**Geronimo:**
Well, that's certainly straightforward.

 


---
 
**C：Yan Qing:**
All right, lost other me, it's time for us to go back where we belong.

 
**C：Yan Qing:**
There's no one left here you need to make amends to.

 
**C：Yan Qing:**
So if we don't put an end to everything here...
we're both gonna be left behind for good!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cursed Arm:**
Khh...

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
We've got you now, Hassan-i Sabbah.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...So it would seem.
Very well, go ahead and take my head.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
Your head? Oh no, I don't want you dead just yet.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
I need to copy your Spirit Origin first.
Otherwise it'd be such a waste of material.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...!

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
Yep, that's right. I'm gonna use your form to pull the wool over those Chaldea chumps' eyes whenever they manage to get here.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...So, you are plotting ahead to ensure you can fully deceive your quarry. You truly are an Assassin born.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Very well then. If that is how it is to be, I will not go down without a fight. I can do no less after being summoned here.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
Oh? You want a piece of me?

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
What an honor, facing off with one of the biggest names in the assassin world.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I thought I was about to die,
powerless to do anything...

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...but it is exactly when one can do nothing that new options open up.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
What...?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...Zabaniya!

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
Hah, nice try! But there's no way you can copy my heart and crush it before I can stop you!

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Indeed, I cannot. Which is why it is fortunate that I have no need to copy you.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
What...!?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hehe... Good. It worked.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
You crushed your own heart? Why?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
You know exactly why.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
If Chaldea comes to save this city,
as I trust they will...

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...then it is my duty as a Servant to help them however I can.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
Wha... Huh!?

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
You're freakin' nuts!
What the hell are you thinking!?

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
You're just throwing your life away for these people without even knowing for sure they're coming!?

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Of course.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
I was summoned here as a Rogue Servant.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
It is therefore my obligation to try and save this city.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
It was my fate...nay, let's just say my duty.
So I have no qualms about laying down my life.

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
...!

 
**Cursed Arm:**
With me dead, your imitation of me will be imperfect.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
...A small stone laid upon your path,
but one you may well trip over.

 
**Cursed Arm:**
Farewell, savior of this city, whomever you may be.
Good luck!

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
D-dammit!

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
The hell was that guy's problem!?
The hell was wrong with him!?

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
It'd be one thing if he was dying for his master,
but for someone he'd never even seen...!?

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
How the hell could anyone go out like that!?

 
**Assassin of Shinjuku:**
Dammit, dammit, dammit!!!

 
**Narration:**
...

It was a shock to my whole Spirit Origin.

 
**Narration:**
I might've betrayed some of my other masters at the last moment, but I still considered myself a faithful servant.

 
**Narration:**
That's why I knew, beyond any doubt...

 
**Narration:**
...that the sacrifice this Assassin was willing to make wasn't something just anyone could do.

 
**Narration:**
What a miserable way to go out.
I've never been more jealous.

 
**Narration:**
Oh God, it hurts.
I can feel my body tearing itself apart!

 
**Narration:**
Master! My master! Why did you go throw your life away with such reckless abandon!

 
**Narration:**
You were so smart! So intelligent! Why did you die for such meaningless, insignificant glory!?

 
**Narration:**
Why can't I figure out why you sacrificed yourself!?

 
**Narration:**
...I didn't get it at all.
I had never been so scared in my life.

 
**Narration:**
I had no idea how I should go about repaying my master for saving my life.

 
**Narration:**
I couldn't think about...anything...anymore...

 
**Yan Qing:**
...So that's how it is.
That “me” both is and isn't me.

 
**Yan Qing:**
He's my doppelgänger.
A Phantom Spirit who wasn't even supposed to exist.

 
**Yan Qing:**
That's why it was so easy to track him down.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Especially since he's been haunting me.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Cursed scent mark?
Sorry, I was just bullshitting you.

 
**Geronimo:**
Does this mean...you and he did not originally share a body then?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Nah, he's pretty much just a copy of me.

 
**Yan Qing:**
I used to be the Assassin of Shinjuku, using my doppelgänger power to turn into anyone and anything.

 
**Yan Qing:**
...But I gradually forgot who I really was,
and ended up losing to Master.

 
**Yan Qing:**
This guy's just the remains of that version of me, but he ended up sorta linking with the version of me that got summoned to Chaldea.

 
**Yan Qing:**
...Yeah, that's it. We were linked. Connected.

 
**Yan Qing:**
That's why you heard I'd Rayshifted here.
He got all mixed up.

 
**Yan Qing:**
He started thinking he was, well, me,
and decided to come back to Shinjuku.

 
**Yan Qing:**
That's why I couldn't forgive myself for what I'd done.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Instead of a gangster who took over Shinjuku, I ended up reverting back into the chivalrous vigilante I always was.

 
**Yan Qing:**
I mean, you've seen for yourself how surprisingly strong my sense of justice is, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
True, you're the most upstanding vigilante I've ever known.
 
**Yan Qing:**
Wahahaha. Thanks for playing along, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought you were a vigilante of darkness.
 
**Yan Qing:**
That's cool, I guess. They're both badass!

 


---
 
**Yan Qing (?):**
Ahh... Ahhh... I can never atone...
I can never make amends...

 
**Yan Qing (?):**
I've always survived by...piling up regret after regret... I hate that...about myself...

 
**Yan Qing:**
That's why you wanted to die,
and why you tried to kill us.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Because you thought trying to kill us would end with you getting killed instead. Am I wrong?

 
**Doppelgänger:**
I... I... I'm everyone...and no one...

 
**Doppelgänger:**
I can be anyone at all, since I lack a core self...yet I also can't be anything, since I have neither goodwill or malice.

 
**Doppelgänger:**
I'm nothing more than a hapless wraith who can only survive in the space between darkness and rumor...

 
**Doppelgänger:**
Which is why...I at least wanted to make amends...

 
**Doppelgänger:**
And yet...I didn't want it to cost me my life...

 
**Doppelgänger:**
So now...I don't know what to do...

 
**Yan Qing:**
Come with me then. Hell, that's the whole reason I'm here: to invite you to join me.

 
**Geronimo:**
Oho. So you want to add a Phantom Spirit on top of all your other personalities?

 
**Geronimo:**
Sure about that?
It might do some damage to your sense of self.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Nah, I'll be fine. I know who I am.
Isn't that right, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think you can probably handle it.
 
**Yan Qing:**
Right!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't say I'm not concerned, but...
 
**Geronimo:**
Once he has made up his mind,
there is no stopping him, huh.

 


---
 
**Doppelgänger:**
A-are you sure? Is it really okay...
if I come with you?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Sure. You'll help make me stronger.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Just don't forget how you feel right now.
How desperately you're longing for justice.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Long as you hold onto that, you'll make a great chivalrous vigilante yet.

 
**Doppelgänger:**
A vigilante...

 
**Doppelgänger:**
People who are loyal and considerate to a fault, but with strong enough senses of morality and self to even defy a king...

 
**Doppelgänger:**
That's what I...want to be...

 
**Mash:**
I've confirmed that the doppelgänger has...not vanished, but became part of Yan Qing.

 
**Mash:**
His Spirit Origin readings are stable.

 
**Yan Qing:**
See? Told you I'd be fine.

 
**Geronimo:**
Even so, this is quite unusual.

 
**Geronimo:**
You should have Da Vinci take a look at you as soon as we get back.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Yup, will do!

 
**Geronimo:**
...
...

 
**Geronimo:**
A doppelgänger who did horrible things in Shinjuku,
all because he lacked a personality of his own...

 
**Geronimo:**
...yet who also attempted to do the right thing once he finally had one...

 
**Geronimo:**
It's a miracle that he existed. No doubt it was only made possible thanks to humanity's current precariousness.

 
**Geronimo:**
So I hope you will remember him,
Master, even if no one else does.

 
**Geronimo:**
It is through your observation that his small tragedy and struggle will live on forever.

 
**Geronimo:**
And for him, there could be no greater honor.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Yeah.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Thanks for believing in me right to the end, Master.
I appreciate that.

 
**Yan Qing:**
As long as I'm here, Fujimaru...
I'll keep fighting for you and you alone!
