# Lanling Wang

## Some Say There Was a Lack of Something Vital

**Narration:**
7:00 a.m.

 
**Narration:**
The time when most Chaldean Servants begin going about their day.

 
**Narration:**
While there are notable exceptions, such as the night owls and Servants who stay in their spirit forms...

 
**Narration:**
...our subject is apparently one of the many who start their day at 7:00 a.m.

 
**Narration:**
Although Servants do not need to eat to survive, many of them choose to do so for the social and psychological benefits.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Good morning, everyone.

 
**Narration:**
 
The subject takes a seat at the dining table.

 
**Narration:**
 
Of course, in his case, his “meal” consists of no more than a slice of bread and a glass of orange juice.

 
**Narration:**
 
After quickly finishing his “meal,” the subject strikes up a conversation with a nearby Servant.

 
**Bartholomew**
Well, what do you know?
I'm a hidden eyes kind of guy too.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I see.

 
**Bartholomew**
Guess this means the day's finally come for you to lower your bangs as well, huh?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Hahaha.
By the way, on a completely different subject...

 
**Bartholomew**
(Damn, he's a slippery one.)

 
**Narration:**
 
8:00 a.m.

 
**Narration:**
 
By this point, the more diligent Servants are already hard at work, whether that entails research, training, investigating, or any number of other fields.

 
**Narration:**
 
Our subject has chosen a simulator training regimen as though it were the most natural thing in the world.

 
**Narration:**
His opponent...

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
I shall be your opponent today.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
You have my thanks, Lord Yagyu.
Now then...have at you!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Okay, I think that's enough for today.
Forgive me for cutting the proceedings short.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I simply fear that if we go any further,
I too may end up treating this like a genuine duel.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
...I see.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
If I may, Prince of Lan Ling, your swordplay strikes me as similar to sword dancing.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
It retains all the grace and suppleness of dance...

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
...without sacrificing the sword's weight or cutting edge.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Haha, that's very kind of you, but my style is nothing to boast about. It's something I had to devise on my own.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
As a general, I was so busy studying politics and warfare that I only had time to learn the bare minimum of martial arts.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
All the techniques I use now were moves I developed on the battlefield. I turned out to be much more adept at dodging than defense, so that's what I tended to focus on.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
I see. So your sword dancing was forged in the heat of battle.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Your swordplay, on the other hand, was breathtakingly refined, Lord Yagyu. I learned a great deal from this sparring session.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
My Otomeryu is not ordinarily meant to be seen by outside eyes...

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
But that was a concern for my living self. Now that I am a Servant&ndash;a shadow sworn to serve a new Master&ndash;it is no longer relevant.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I see. Now that humanity itself is in crisis,
we can't be choosy about how we fight back.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Be that as it may, I am afraid I cannot allow myself to copy your style.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
My son, Mitsuyoshi, would have no compunctions about claiming any technique he liked as his own, but no matter.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Does that mean your son has a different style than you, Lord Yagyu?

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Oh yes, very different. His talent with the blade came to him naturally, and his technique can only be described as flawless.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Nonetheless, the world is a big place. There is surely someone somewhere strong enough to rend steel with their bare hands.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Ah yes, like the ones descended from living, breathing gods.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Good point. Then I suppose we will just have to train hard enough to keep up with them.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Indeed.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Oh, it looks like the next group is here.
I'd best be on my way then.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Very well. Until the next time.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Hmm. It seems he noticed my warrior's instincts getting the best of me. What a pity.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
Now then, you there.

 
**Narration:**
 
Urk.

 
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami**
What have you been doing this whole time?

 
**Narration:**
 
After being called out by the nonsubject male,
I decided to make a swift and quiet getaway.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Narration:**
12:00 p.m.
Lunchtime.

 
**Narration:**
However, the subject heads to the underground library rather than the cafeteria.

 
**Narration:**
Oh, just for the record...

 
**Narration:**
I'd like you all to know that the library's name was recently changed to:

 
**Narration:**
...“The Great and Terrible Yet Beautiful Murasaki Shikibu Library” I've heard so much about!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Oh, hello, Prince of Lan Ling.
What sort of book are you looking for today?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Good question...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Well, we did just get in a few grimoires and valuable antique books thanks to a certain, um, anonymous donor...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I see.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
(Despite getting new books, she seems rather preoccupied...)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
I'm afraid we have yet to receive the new shipment of military strategy books I've been expecting...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Oh, I know. What about a book that Master would like?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I could bring it with me the next time I visit [♂ him /♀️ her].

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Oh, what a lovely idea.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Okay then, wait here, please.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Um, let's see...
I think it was above this shelf...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Uh-oh.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Aah!

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Forgive me. This was the only way I could think to help in the short time I had to act.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
O-o-oh gosh, I'm so terribly sorry!

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Not at all. The important thing is that you're okay.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
O-oh, yes, I'm fine. Besides, it's all my fault for not being more careful...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Accidents happen to the best of us.
Please, pay it no mind.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
So, is this the book you were looking for?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Y-yes, that's it.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Then I'll go ahead and check it out straight away.
Thank you for your help.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
My pleasure.

 
**Narration:**
...And so our subject makes a graceful exit, apologizing for his intrusion in touching Murasaki Shikibu's body even as his gentle smile makes it clear he meant no harm.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
(Sigh)...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
That may well be the most beautiful man I've ever met, in multiple senses of the word.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
Even with the mask on, he had my heart pounding. I shudder to think of what may have happened had he not been wearing it.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu**
...H-hang on. I think I might be able to use this feeling in a story! I'll go write it down in my idea notebook right now.

 
**Narration:**
4:00 p.m.

 
**Narration:**
The subject strikes up a conversation with two passersby.

 
**Paris**
I see...
So that's why you wear that mask.

 
**Jason**
Man, it's a good thing you weren't born in Greece.

 
**Jason**
Back there, good looks like that would either get you cursed or blessed, and there'd be hell to pay either way.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I can understand the downside of being cursed...
but wouldn't a blessing be a good thing?

 
**Jason**
Hardly. Sure, a blessing might mean you'd be living the good life for a while, but one wrong word and bam, the gods go divine retribution on your ass.

 
**Jason**
Hell, maybe they just decide to go retribution on you 'cause they think you're getting too full of yourself.

 
**Jason**
Either way, the only ending you'd get is a bad one!

 
**Paris**
Oh yeah, that sort of thing happened all the time!

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I see. It sounds like Greece had its fair share of troubles as well...

 
**Jason**
Then again, you wouldn't be the first to hide your face under a mask. Pency used to do the same thing.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Pency?

 
**Jason**
You know, the Berserker who's always flying off the handle?

 
**Jason**
Real short?
Abs that could grate cheese?

 
**Paris**
(Apollo's getting a bad feeling about this!
Abort! Abort!)

 
**Jason**
What was her real name again?
Oh, right!

 
**Jason**
Pencil-Lilia!

 
**Penthesilea**
You mangled my name on purpose! DIE!!!

 
**Jason**
Huh&ndash;WAAAH!

 
**Penthesilea**
(Huff, huff...)

 
**Penthesilea**
(Glare)

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
For the record, I swear on my honor that I never said anything untoward about you.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
That said, I should have stopped Lord Jason before he shouted your mangled name. For that, I sincerely apologize.

 
**Penthesilea**
...Very well. But I should mention that I have no desire for there to be any bad blood between us.

 
**Penthesilea**
Come with me to the simulator.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Does that mean you wish to fight?

 
**Penthesilea**
I would have let you go if you were a Caster, but as you are a Saber, you should be capable of defending your honor yourself.

 
**Penthesilea**
Unless, of course, that sword of yours is just for show?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
...I suppose you're right.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Besides, I could learn a great deal by facing one of Greece's fiercest warriors in mortal combat.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Very well then, let us do battle.

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Penthesilea**
I have seen the truth of your words in the strength of your sword arm. Very well then, our battle is concluded!

 
**Penthesilea**
I accept you as a fellow warrior and now trust your word that you meant no disrespect!

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Thank you, Lady Penthesilea.

 
**Penthesilea**
By the way, that mask of yours...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Yes?

 
**Penthesilea**
I assume you do not get moisture buildup on your face when you are fighting while wearing it? That must be nice.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
That's right, I don't. This mask only covers my eyes, so there's plenty of room for air to circulate.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Of course, it also extends up past my face, so I have to be careful when going through doors and such.

 
**Penthesilea**
Hmm... I see.

 
**Penthesilea**
The climate may have been largely responsible for this, but I always found quite a lot of moisture built up in my mask when I wore it in battle.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Was it the kind that covers your entire face?

 
**Penthesilea**
It was. I cannot tell you how terribly I felt the urge simply to scratch my nose on countless occasions.

 
**Narration:**
And so Penthesilea and our subject continued their pleasant conversation about masks.

 
**Narration:**
 
When it was over, they both went merrily on their way, much to my relief.

 
**Jason**
I-I only mangled it on purpose a little bit...

 
**Narration:**
 
Jason, of course, remains clueless.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Narration:**
6:00 p.m.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
...
...

 
**Narration:**
 
The subject suddenly goes silent.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I've been looking the other way since you didn't seem to mean any harm, but now that you've been following me around all day, I feel compelled to ask.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
What is it you want with me, Lord Blackbeard!?

 
**Blackbeard**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You wanna run that by me again?

---
 
**Blackbeard**
I just told you! What's the freaking deal with that pretty boy!?

 
**Blackbeard**
Prince of Lan Ling?
More like Prince of OP Super Hotties!

 
**Blackbeard**
I mean, I know Chaldea's always had more than its fair share of hunks, but he just takes it too far!

 
**Fou**
Fou. Fooou...

 
**Blackbeard**
Take Bartholomew. He might act all dandy, but it doesn't take long to see he's a gross creepfest on the inside!

 
**Blackbeard**
So you just know that Lan Ling guy's got to be hiding something too!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you're jealous of him? Is that what this is about?

---
 
**Blackbeard**
Me? Jealous? Of him?
Pfft. No way. Not in a million years.

 
**Fou**
Fou.

 
**Blackbeard**
I just figure nobody could actually be that perfect,
so there must be something we're not seeing.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know. He seems pretty perfect to me.
 
**Blackbeard**
Well, I don't buy it. Guys like that always end up having some kind of weird fetish or something they don't wanna tell anyone else about, guaranteed.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So what if there is?

 
**Blackbeard**
Well, if there's something we're not seeing, I wanna see it, dammit!

 
**Blackbeard**
Besides, it's just human nature to want to find fault with anyone who seems too good to be true!


---
 
**Blackbeard**
Which is why I'm not going to rest until I've uncovered the truth about him!

 
**Blackbeard**
Wooo, let's do this thing!
Gimme a C! H! A! L! D! E! A! Gooo Chaldea!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What was that all about...?

---
 
**Blackbeard**
And so, I have returned with my findings!

 
**Blackbeard**
Long story short:

 
**Blackbeard**
He's handsome on the inside too!!!

 
**Blackbeard**
(Sigh) What a letdown.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Th-that's why you were following me around all day?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have to admit, you really were a perfect gentleman...

---
 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Now don't you start too, Master!

 
**Blackbeard**
Right!? Just look at how carefully he placed his hands when he caught Murasaki!

 
**Blackbeard**
See how he did his best to avoid touching her skin even as he made sure to support her head?

 
**Blackbeard**
If I didn't know better, I'd have sworn I was watching a scene straight out of a visual romance novel (the kind that induces serious blushing).

 
**Blackbeard**
Incidentally, scenes like that are called “CGs” in some games, depending on the genre.

 
**Blackbeard**
The more you know, amirite!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-it really is like poetry in motion...

---
 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
When did you even record that?

 
**Blackbeard**
Oh yes, I'm not too proud to admit that my inner badump circuit was running like crazy while this was going down.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't even know you had a...whatever that is.

---
 
**Blackbeard**
Oh sure. It's right between my heart and my stomach.

 
**Blackbeard**
Once it spins up, you get palpitations, flop sweat, fever, flushed skin, dizzy spells, weak knees, and hyperventilation, though not necessarily in that order.

 
**Blackbeard**
You know, now that I think about it, I really should look into getting that circuit removed!

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Um... Master? Could we please make that...man stop?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I guess we should. (That circuit sounds like seriously bad news)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
True, this has definitely gone on long enough.

---

 
**Blackbeard**
Oh yeah? Then let's take this outside! I know I might not look it, but I'm still an ultra badass pirate!

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
(The fact that it's true only makes him that much more difficult to deal with...)

 
**Blackbeard**
Hehehe... What a lucky break for me,
getting to fight on a ship.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Are you sure you didn't touch the simulation's settings!?

 
**Blackbeard**
Heh heh heh.

 
**Blackbeard**
If you think that's all I've got in store for you,
you're gravely mistaken.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
What?

 
**Blackbeard**
Let's just say that Blackbeard is never alone!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean there's another one of you? Oh gods, please no.
 
**Blackbeard**
Thank you for your honesty, Master.
It's much appreciated.

 
**Blackbeard**
We hope you'll continue to enjoy Blackbeard brand products for many years to come.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean you've still got crew members!?

 
**Blackbeard**
Hehehe. You won't find the sad sack Blackbeard who used to lie on the ground weeping tears of loneliness here anymore.

 
**Blackbeard**
Er, not that he ever existed to begin with, of course.

 

---
 
**Blackbeard**
All right, tactician, come forth!

 
**Chen Gong**
Good day, everyone. I am Chen Gong, the tactician Lord Blackbeard just spoke of.

 
**Chen Gong**
I'm a busy man, of course, but as I was told this is a time-sensitive matter, I decided to leave my errant tasks for later and drop by.

 
**Chen Gong**
And by time-sensitive matter, well...
I trust you know of what I speak?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
(Um, Master?)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I think I can already see where this is going...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Just be ready to run for it at a moment's notice!)

---

 
**Blackbeard**
All right, let's do this thing! By the way, tactician,
can I ask why you're standing directly behind me?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Chen Gong**
I know what you're thinking, so before you even ask:
it was a necessary sacrifice.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
If you say so...

 
**Blackbeard**
Gaaah! I really thought I was done for!

 
**Blackbeard**
Who knew just activating Guts took so much energy...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Easy there. Are you all right, Lord Blackbeard?

 
**Blackbeard**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
THIS is the music they're playing now!?

---
 
**Blackbeard**
Oh man, I finally got that event CG I wanted after all...

 
**Blackbeard**
I can feel my badump circuit whirring around... Pretty soon, I'll be my own little Blackbeard Restoration Labyrinth...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
(No earthly idea what he's talking about)

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
This has been a very tiring day...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I bet!
 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Lord Blackbeard seemed very dejected when he left...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I do hope he'll be okay.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was kind of refreshing seeing you perturbed for once, though.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
You know, you can be kind of mean-spirited sometimes, Master.

 

---
 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Still, I haven't had a day like this in a long time.
For that, I owe Lord Blackbeard my thanks.

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Having your day turned upside down by someone you least expected may seem exhausting from the outside...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
...but if nothing else,
there's certainly never a dull moment.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Welcome to my life.

---
 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
Oh, right! I guess you do experience that all the time, don't you?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
...
...

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
In that case, Master, would you like to swap war stories with me tonight?

 
**Prince of Lan Ling**
I suspect that both of us have plenty of tales of hardship we could tell.
