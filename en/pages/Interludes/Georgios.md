<h2>St. George</h2>

**Mash**
Teacher, I have a question.
What's the difference between a lizard and a dragon?

 
**Georgios**
Good question. To answer, first we'll have to talk about the phantasmal species&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
So, um, what's going on here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Teacher?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not sure...
 


---
 
**Georgios**
You there! No whispering in class!
This is important.

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, right... But we need to get going...
to the next dimensional distortion.

 
**Georgios**
True. That's enough prepping, we will continue the lecture as in-field studies.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Our goal this time is to repair a space that became unstable due to the last Rayshift.

 
**Dr. Roman**
The problem should have fixed itself when we restored the timeline, but a little remained.

 
**Dr. Roman**
My analysis shows that a number of phantasmal species, AKA dragons, have fled there.

 
**Dr. Roman**
If we don't fix it, the distortion may cause a wide-scale dimensional collapse.

 
**Mash**
So the distortion isn't disappearing because of the dragon's magical energy, right?

 
**Georgios**
Phantasmal species...dragons in particular generate magical energy just by breathing.

 
**Georgios**
The output of such energy is capable of maintaining the distortion.

 
**Mash**
Let's go then, Senpai.
Doctor, send us there.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Okay, this is an irregular Rayshift, but it's all set.
Fujimaru, go slay us some dragons.

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
So this is the dimensional distortion...

 
**Fou**
Fooou.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Looks like you made it.
But this...It's like another world.

 
**Georgios**
It's a rare phenomenon, but I'm detecting draconic essence from our surroundings.

 
**Georgios**
Let's take a photo to record this.

 
**Mash**
Is that...a camera?

 
**Georgios**
Yes, Master let me borrow it.
There were none in my time.

 
**Georgios**
It is a truly powerful relic that instantly paints what you see.

 
**Georgios**
At first, I just collected the paintings, but lately I've gotten into it.

 
**Georgios**
Look at this new lens for instance!
Photography is a fascinating and endless abyss.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Glad you like it.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Relic...
 


---
 
**Georgios**
Thank you for this wonderful present.
I shall repay you with my blade.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hey, no time for talking!
They're here! Three of them!

 
**Georgios**
Master, be careful.
Let's be on our way, then!

 
**Fou**
Fou!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
We did it, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We killed the dragons!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this all?
 


---
 
**Georgios**
No, these were a lower subspecies of dragon called wyverns.

 
**Georgios**
These wyverns lack the magical energy to maintain such a space as this.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah, defeating them didn't change anything.
Hmm, I'll trace the reaction...W-What the heck?

 
**Georgios**
...There it is. Prepare the cam...
I mean, prepare for combat.

 
**Dr. Roman**
This reaction's incredible...
It's three times bigger than a normal dragon!

 
**Dr. Roman**
I mean, there aren't really normal dragons, but...
What's going on here?

 
**Mash**
A mutation...or something like it?

 
**Georgios**
No, nothing so simple.
It feels as if it's absorbed the others.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Absorbed them?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean it ate them?
 


---
 
**Georgios**
Yes, I've never seen a cannibalistic dragon before.
&mdash;It has power, but little intelligence.

 
**Georgios**
Either way, it's still a rare species.
Let me take a photograph.

 
**Dr. Roman**
You can do that later!
But if it ate the other dragons...

 
**Dr. Roman**
A dragon's just a giant lump of magical energy...
If it ate them all...this thing is crazy!

 
**Mash**
Mr. Geo, how do we deal with this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mr. Geo...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do we do?
 


---
 
**Georgios**
Calm down, Mash. Your teacher's name is Mr. Georgios, not Mr. Geo.

 
**Georgios**
And it doesn't matter what kind of dragon it is, none shall survive our attack.

 
**Georgios**
Dragons were born to be eradicated.
Be punished for your sins, dragon!

 
**Mash**
Let's go, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Georgios**
This is the end, take this!
Ascalon!

 
**Mash**
D-Did we get it...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Man, that was one tough enemy, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, now that the dragon's gone, the distortion is starting to close.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'll bring you guys back, get ready.
Setting coordinates now...

 
**Georgios**
&ndash;Nameless dragon of another world, rest in peace.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Teacher...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't dragons sinners?
 


---
 
**Georgios**
Even if dragons are sinners born to be destroyed, that doesn't mean they deserve to be destroyed.

 
**Georgios**
&ndash;Sin and punishment should be separate things.

 
**Mash**
Senpai, we need to go or the distortion will close...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go, Teacher.
 


---
 
**Georgios**
Yes...
Oh, let me get one last photo...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Forget about that!

 
**Fou**
Fooou.
