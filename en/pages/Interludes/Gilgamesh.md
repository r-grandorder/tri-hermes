# Gilgamesh

<h2>What's Worthy</h2>

**Gilgamesh**
So this is the fate of the Greater Grail?
&mdash;Hmph. A terrible end.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Based on what I know, if everything had gone the way they should, the ceremony could have accomplished something.

 
**Mash**
...Um.
Gilgamesh, do you know about the Greater Grail?

 
**Gilgamesh**
&mdash;

 
**Mash**
S-Sorry...
It was impudent of me to even speak, wasn't it...

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fear not. You must be the Demi-Servant. Then I shall allow it. However, refer me as your King from now on.

 
**Mash**
S-Sure!
T-T-Then from now on, I'll call you by King of Heroes!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh my. The scary King of the Uruks has taken a liking to our Mash.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Think he's got his reasons?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Mage. No, I see that you refer to yourself as a Doctor,
then Physician is what I shall call you.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Physician from the future.
What are you people, this Chaldea?

 
**Gilgamesh**
I speak not only of the Demi-Servant.
The young one there is far too inexperienced.

 
**Gilgamesh**
An incomplete warrior and a barely competent Master.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Do you truly believe a pairing like that can secure the future of humanity?

 
**Dr. Roman**
That's harsh. It was a tough decision for me, too.
Right, Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There are no other Masters.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I must fight even if I'm not competent.
 


---
 
**Mash**
Senp... no, Master is right.
I understand that you disapprove of us.

 
**Mash**
But there's no one else left at Chaldea who can fight.

 
**Mash**
We have no choice but to mature through this battle, O King of Heroes.

 
**Gilgamesh**
So you fight because you must... If you put it that way,
then I can't question such determination any further.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Humans are creatures that only develop their talents for the sake of the benefits they gain.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fujimaru. Mash. Ascertain to the utmost what your benefits are in this battle.

 
**Gilgamesh**
But first, you must guarantee my benefits.
Otherwise, we will be enemies.

 
**Mash**
E-Enemy!? S-S-Senpai, what do you think benefits the King of Heroes?

 
**Mash**
Treasure? It's treasure, isn't it?
But we don't have any treasure that could satisfy him!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, more like we want treasure!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Help us, Doctor!
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh**
Don't lose your composure. I expect no treasure from you. What I seek from you is, THAT.

 
**Monster**
FUUUUuuuuuuu&mdash;

 
**Mash**
Shadow Servants!
We're surrounded, Master!

 
**Gilgamesh**
The souls of the dead came at my call. Fujimaru. I shall use them to test your worth.

 
**Gilgamesh**
I expect victory, though it need not be overwhelming.
I seek an entertaining victory.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, he just wants to test his Master.
No need to hold back, then.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Fujimaru, Mash! Show that King what you can do!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Of course, don't forget to also give the King of Heroes your orders. You are his Master right now, after all.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
S-Sure!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course, lots of orders!
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh**
That Physician always seeks the last word. It must be hard having him as your boss, Fujimaru.

 
**Gilgamesh**
But, he speaks the truth. No matter how inexperienced,
you are the [♂ man /♀️ woman} I contracted with.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fear me, respect me,
and fulfill your duty as the one who contracted with me!


**--BATTLE--**

**Gilgamesh**
I suppose that will do. How does it feel to survive what could have been a Holy Grail War?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was a Holy Grail War?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That was really something...
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh**
Excellent. I was slightly entertained.
Your struggles were quite an enjoyment.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Know that this is what benefits me.
For now, at least.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hmm... so the King of Heroes dislikes humans?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Fujimaru is one thing, but you're saying humanity isn't worth protecting?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Are you a fool? There is no like or dislike.
Humans simply have no value.

 
**Mash**
Huh?

 
**Gilgamesh**
All of you, remember this. Humans have no value.
Their creations, however, are worth something.

 
**Gilgamesh**
I love one thing: results.
Think well on this, and never forget it.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...I see. So that's the kind of king he is.
This Servant's going to be a handful.

 
**Dr. Roman**
But he's certainly powerful.
You can count on him to the end.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Although it'll be tough, so good luck, Fujimaru.
I'm trusting you to take care of the King of Heroes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-Okay...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not sure if I can do it...
 


---
 
**Mash**
G-Good luck, Senpai!
I'm not much, but I have your back!

 
**Fou**
Fou, fou.


<h2>Law of Creation</h2>

**Gilgamesh**
&mdash;

 
**Mash**
(The King... He seems angry and irritated...
He's in the worst mood possible, Senpai!)

 
**Fou**
Kyu... Kuu, fouuuuu...

 
**Dr. Roman**
(First the Massive Cavern, now Angrboda...
Maybe he has some attachment towards the Grail?)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Maybe it's just a whim?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Maybe he likes to feel like a Last Boss?
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh**
I can hear you, Chaldea trio. Your imprudence and optimism can even feel refreshing.

 
**Gilgamesh**
I am not observing the remains of the Greater Grail, but rather the disposition of the one who made it.

 
**Mash**
The one who made the Greater Grail...

 
**Mash**
Back in Angrboda, it was “M”... a mage named Makiri Zolgen. Do you mean him?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fool. The likes of Makiri cannot create cauldrons of magic. This is&mdash; No, I shall remain silent for now.

 
**Gilgamesh**
All the clairvoyants other than myself are keeping their mouths shut.

 
**Gilgamesh**
If I say anything here, all their efforts will be for naught, yes?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wow! Who knew the King of Heroes was capable of showing consideration for other people!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Hmmmm. However, who do you mean by the other “clairvoyants”?

 
**Gilgamesh**
&mdash;Perhaps the most famous would be him, that half-incubus mage...

 
**Gilgamesh**
Merlin, the Mage of Flowers. If what I have heard about his powers is true, he could also see the obsession burned into this Greater Grail.

 
**Mash**
...Obsession? You mean there's a curse placed on this Magical Reactor Core?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Indeed. As proof, look. The souls of those who have failed to die have gathered.

 
**Mash**
Master, look out!
I've detected hostiles from within the fog!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Looks like the ghosts that were seared onto this land.
Fujimaru, you should be able to handle them now.

 
**Dr. Roman**
You're in the presence of the King of Heroes.
You have my permission to go crazy to impress him!

 
**--BATTLE--**

**Gilgamesh**
The dead never learn. They're like moths to a flame&mdash;Hmm?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Be careful! I'm picking up a large amount of magical energy! Is the core still active!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'm seeing an A-Rank Servant heading for you!
Fujimaru, Mash, be careful!

 
**Gilgamesh**
I see it's not only humans that retain their attachment to the world of the living even in death.

 
**Gilgamesh**
These are the remnants of a dream. The dying screams of those who dreamed of progress and a brighter world.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Very well. You are worthy of my judgment.
Fujimaru, prepare yourself.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Just like the physician said, if you can defeat him, I'll give you a reward.


**--BATTLE--**

**Gilgamesh**
So you defeated it. After fighting it, I found it to be nothing more than a boring monster.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Hatred cannot dwell in a silent machine. That was the obsession of the fool who made the Greater Grail.

 
**Dr. Roman**
O King of Heroes, what do you mean?

 
**Gilgamesh**
The hatred of the enemy that Chaldea seeks, the one who seeks to incinerate the history of man.

 
**Gilgamesh**
I have little interest in the battle this time around.
I don't care who's the mastermind.

 
**Gilgamesh**
However&mdash; This I shall say. Fujimaru, what you're chasing is an avatar of hatred.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Of course, there are different types of hatred.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Hatred born of righteousness, or love.
Hatred born of jealousy, or anger.

 
**Gilgamesh**
This hatred is&mdash;
Yes, it is a most “foolish” hatred.

 
**Mash**
A foolish hatred?
Generally speaking, hatred is not good for anyone.

 
**Mash**
But from a broader perspective, there is neither “good hatred” nor “bad hatred.” In that case, my King, what makes you call it foolish?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Idiot. Look at what's around you. Nothing is born, nothing is achieved... The ultimate form of idleness.

 
**Gilgamesh**
If this isn't foolish, what is!?
Nothing here is saved!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Listen, Mash. May it be evil or foolish, all actions result in benefit.

 
**Gilgamesh**
But this kind of hatred exists as well: the hatred of a fool obsessed with leaving nothing behind.

 
**Gilgamesh**
...It matters not.
Someday you shall face this thing.

 
**Gilgamesh**
And when you do, remember what it is you fought to protect.

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Dr. Roman**
The problem with this king is that he occasionally says things that seem significant.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Well, we should keep his words in mind, with a grain of salt that is. Okay, let's head back, Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman**
It seems like the King's in a better mood.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Hold on, we forgot something...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Um, where's my reward?
 


---
 
**Mash**
Oh, that's right. The King promised a reward.

 
**Mash**
He said if we beat this monster he'd reward us!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fool. Would I ever break a promise?
The reward has been granted already.

 
**Gilgamesh**
One way or another, you'll understand during the next battle. Boorish fool, don't make me explain everything to you.


<h2>Law of Heaven</h2>

**Gilgamesh**
I hear there are dragons on this island.
Naturally, we shall go on a hunting trip. Now prepare yourselves, mongrels.

 
**Mash**
O-Of course. But my King, some regions revere dragons as gods, so wouldn't we be cursed or suffer divine punishment for troubling what could be a local deity?

 
**Dr. Roman**
It won't work, Mash. Saying that kind of stuff will only get him more pumped up.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Those are insignificant for my king.
 
**Gilgamesh**
Hmph, it seems Fujimaru is starting to understand.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Indeed, those who would dare cower themselves before the gods shall be punished my hands.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Alright! Time for a good hunt!
 
**Gilgamesh**
Indeed it is! Fine reply, Fujimaru! It seems your heart is starting to understand the joys of battle!

 


---
 
**Mash**
This is not good, Doctor. Senpai and the Golden King are suddenly on the same wavelength!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah. Talk about unexpected.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'm not sure if it's because Fujimaru can get along with everyone, or Gilgamesh is just more reasonable than we believed.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Either way, both of them are in perfect sync.
Even if it's just a momentary miracle!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Hah hah hah. I only came here to while away the time, but it actually looks like things are starting to get entertaining! Fujimaru, prepare yourself for a grand adventure!

 
**Monster**
GuyyyyyyyoooOOOOO!

 
**Mash**
And of course there would be a monster waiting!
Senpai, this is starting to feel like a stereotypical pattern!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Foolish girl, we are going to hunt down dragons! Then it is only natural to encounter monsters in a forest...

 
**Gilgamesh**
...or perhaps monsters in a cave, or even more powerful monsters in the depth of that cave!

 
**Gilgamesh**
And that is what makes any adventure a tale worth telling for! Do not be mistaken about that!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
We finally made it through the forest, and now we're facing a labyrinth? ...Master, I'm sure you understand by now...

 
**Monster**
...Mah.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Interesting, golems constructed using the language of dragons is quite a rare sight. It seems there is a knowledgable one amongst the dragons fallen here.

 
**Mash**
Those are powerful golems standing in our way.
We have no choice but to defeat them. Right, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash... Are you mad?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
C'mon, let's enjoy this, okay?
 


---
 
**Mash**
I don't have time for that! I shouldn't worry because both Senpai and the King are by my side, but fighting golems made by dragons is scary!


**--BATTLE--**

**Dragon**
Welcome, and how are you today?
This is my magical workshop, Vortak's Dragonbones.

 
**Dragon**
An underground labyrinth was slated to undergo construction to lure some unlucky humans in so I can slaughter them and take their money but...

 
**Dragon**
...We're actually still a month away from our grand opening, but your timing couldn't be more perfect: I was just looking for some helpers.

 
**Dragon**
Therefore, as much as I want to let you go, I guess I can't really do that. Especially now you found out about my grand plan.

 
**Dragon**
Get roasted by my breath and succumb to your fate. I'd like you well-done and working a 60-hour week as my bone-cushion.

 
**Mash**
...I didn't have my hopes up, but this is just terrible.

 
**Mash**
If King Gilgamesh is invovled, either we get something really scary or really weird!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Hahahaha, your praise is music to my ears, Mash!
But even I am at a loss for words!

 
**Gilgamesh**
I came searching for a dragon so I may test my Master's worth, but to think I would find such an idiot here!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fujimaru, accept this as your fate.
Minds that think alike attracts each other.

 
**Gilgamesh**
It seems your lot in life is to have idiots as your worthy opponents.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't think that statement applies to me...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know. I'm like a weirdo magnet.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
I hate to interrupt when you're having fun. Despite that dragon's behavior, that thing there is the real deal!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It has more magical energy than an A-rank Servant!
It might be even more powerful than Fafnir!

 
**Mash**
No way! It looks like it has such a dreadful brain though!

 
**Dragon**
My brain is not dreadful.
My thoughts are dreadful. Nay, evil!

 
**Dragon**
It costs you nothing to enter, but everything to leave! I'll suck your bones dry and throw you away like a pile of trash!


**--BATTLE--**

**Dragon**
Guaaaaaaarrrrrgghhhh!
To be defeated even before my grand opening...

 
**Dragon**
It can't be... Are you the Counter Force that will eliminate any threat to the world before it occurs&ndash;The Seventh Guardian!?

 
**Mash**
...The battle is over... Who knew that idiot of a dragon would be so powerful... It really was the worst...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Whoa... Not only that, this guy is dirt poor!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Dragons are generally known for hoarding treasure, but this one's lair is as empty as its skull!

 
**Dr. Roman**
There's nothing good about this dragon!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Is that true!? I cannot believe my eyes... His treasury is completely empty...

 
**Gilgamesh**
It must have wasted everything on trying to build its labyrinth...

 
**Gilgamesh**
Couldn't even scrounge up some treasure to leave at the finish line, the worthless fool...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Well, our goal here was never this labyrinth to begin with...

 
**Mash**
That's right. My King, you said earlier you wanted to test Senpai's worth...

 
**Mash**
Is that just you being considerate? So that Senpai can be acknowledged as a proper Master?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fool, do not utter such nonsense.

 
**Gilgamesh**
A proper Master? The day this [♂ boy /♀️ girl} becomes a proper Master, this world shall no doubt be saved already.

 
**Gilgamesh**
I simply came here to sharpen the edge of my treasured sword, Ea. I was sure Ea would end up in a good mood if it faced a dragon.

 
**Gilgamesh**
However... Hm... Fujimaru, you have done well for a mongrel.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Our enemy was the worst this time, but I shall find you worthy prey next time.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Accept that as the proof of your own growth. You have become a mage worthy of hunting the most exquisite prey.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you for your gracious words, O King of Heroes.
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh**
Hmph, it was but a trivial matter. No need to thank me. Now then, it's time to go; I have no more use for this miserable place.

 
**Mash**
My King, wait! ...He went on ahead. Was he trying to hide his own embarrassment?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I don't think so. He might just be bored of us. Ultimately, that man has no concept of embarrassment or sympathy.

 
**Mash**
...Either way, there's no doubt he has acknowledged us.

 
**Mash**
I was a little nervous and unsure of what's going to happen when he formed a contract with us... But his arrogance and self-righteousness is rather reliable now.

 
**Fou**
Fooou!
