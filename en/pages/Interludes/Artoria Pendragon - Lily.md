# Artoria Pendragon (Lily)

## Sword of a Young Flower

**Saber Lily**
The town is so peaceful despite the war. There are so many stores open along the main street here. It's a sight for sore eyes.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You seem to be in a fine mood, Saber.

 
**Saber Lily**
Yes. It is true that we are in enemy territory, but it is still pleasant to observe people going about their daily lives.

 
**Saber Lily**
...Admittedly, it does pain me to see France and England at war during this era.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Want to get something to eat?

 
**Saber Lily**
Oh, thank you.

 
**Saber Lily**
I appreciate the thought, but for now I am content just to breathe the air here.

---
 
**Dr. Roman**
I see. You look so young that I forgot your royal status.
I guess your first concern is the town's safety.

 
**Saber Lily**
Oh...Yes, that's right. I will be a king someday,
so I need to properly understand how things work here...

 
**Saber Lily**
I apologize for acting like a tourist.
There is still so much I need to learn...

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Dr. Roman**
I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
It's just, this is all so hard to take in.

 
**Dr. Roman**
She's a serious, kind girl,
but we've all seen a different side to her...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean the "Dark Saber" in Fuyuki?

 
**Mash**
It's true they share physical characteristics, but they aren't the same Saber.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They are nothing alike.

 
**Mash**
You're right. Even if they're the same entity,
she has nothing to do with that Dark Saber.

---

 
**Saber Lily**
Someone who resembles me?
I'm curious. What was she like?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, what a pure smile... It seems like she has no idea just how terrifying her other self was...

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Saber Lily**
I don't recognize this familiar.
...Yet, I feel like I have some recollection of it...

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
Fou says, "Don't worry about your other self!"

 
**Saber Lily**
I see...but it's unsettling, isn't it?
That "other self" isn't very nice.

 
**Saber Lily**
I mean, if the person in question is my future self, I was hoping to get some advice that might make my life a little easier.

 
**Mash**
Advice?
Saber, you're still in training, right?

 
**Saber Lily**
Yes. Although I chose to walk the path of swordsmanship, I was serving my brother up until this point.

 
**Saber Lily**
Now I continue to polish my swordsmanship and broaden my horizons.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I see. Not just an aspiring knight, but also a king in the making. As far as I can see, your skills are already impeccable...

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Hey Fujimaru, there's something about her that's been bothering me for a while now. Can I ask her?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Go ahead, Doctor.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Feel free to dig your own grave Doctor.

---
 

 
**Dr. Roman**
Well then, if I may ...Ahem Saber, this is a bit of a direct question, but...

 
**Dr. Roman**
What's up with those clothes?
I mean, isn't that skirt kind of short?

 
**Mash**
Doctor! We were trying to ignore that.
Did you really have to say it out loud?

 
**Saber Lily**
Th-These clothes?
I see, indeed...They somewhat concern me as well.

 
**Saber Lily**
I am not used to wearing such feminine clothes...
But Merlin suggested it would help mask my identity.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Merlin! The mage who served King Arthur,
the protector of Britain!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Who knew such a legendary figure would press his taste upon you?

 
**Saber Lily**
Yes. I weave my own magical energy into armor,
but he told me not to rely on it.

 
**Saber Lily**
He said I get to be more reckless now, that I should fight more freely and lightly.

 
**Mash**
...I see. One could expect no less from Merlin,
the famed kingmaker.

 
**Mash**
True, seeing Saber in her current state, not many could guess she would one day rule over Britain as the King of Knights.

 
**Saber Lily**
R-Really? Someone like me will rule...No, I mustn't show weakness! Of course, I will do everything I can to be worthy of that position.

 
**Townsperson**
The castle gates are about to be breached!
Everyone, run for your lives!

 
**Saber Lily**
Hmm, sounds like trouble at the gates. Judging from the noise, I imagine it's an enemy attack.

 
**Saber Lily**
Unfortunately, it seems our brief break ends here.
Let's go, Fujimaru.

 
**Saber Lily**
No matter the era, even if it's an enemy territory,
no one should be allowed to disturb this peace.

 
**Saber Lily**
I, Saber Lily, vow to protect you as a proud Heroic Spirit!


**--BATTLE--**

**Saber Lily**
Oh, it seems like we left town during combat.
The gates...have been shut behind us.

 
**Dr. Roman**
No use blaming the townspeople, they're trying to survive. We're just drifters, looking out for ourselves.

 
**Saber Lily**
Yes. For now, I am just happy to be able to travel with Fujimaru.

 
**Saber Lily**
I still have a lot to learn, but...as we fight together, I want you to teach me as much as possible.

 
**Saber Lily**
If I'm with you I won't give up, and I know that I can continue to fight for my ideals.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.

 
**Saber Lily**
I'm glad...
Thank you, Master.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
When you're king, don't forget my rewards.
 
**Saber Lily**
R-Rewards, you say?
Yes, anything within my capabilities&mdash;

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Saber Lily**
Oh, it seems Fou is opposed to this idea...
I thought that a king could return favors easily...

---
 
**Dr. Roman**
Sorry, but we should get moving. If we stay here too long, the soldiers might come down from the gates.

 
**Saber Lily**
Yes.
We shouldn't needlessly alarm them.

 
**Saber Lily**
Let's continue our training, Master.
I'll devote myself to becoming a great king!
