# Stheno

<h2>It's Not Impossible?</h2>

**Mash**
...Treasure hunting?

 
**Stheno**
No, it is a bit different.
The purpose of this request is different from before.

 
**Stheno**
What I want to ask you is to hunt down the one who wrecked the place where I hid the treasure.

 
**Stheno**
The place is, yes, where I previously materialized.
The Shaped Isle&ndash;in the 1st Century.

 
**Mash**
I remember.
It's a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea.

 
**Stheno**
Yes.
On that island, I hid away many treasures.

 
**Stheno**
I thought I could go reclaim them if I was summoned as a Heroic Spirit again, like now.

 
**Stheno**
But when I went there to check things out, the peaceful paradise was no more.

 
**Stheno**
I'm sure back in the 1st Century some wretch dug the treasures up.

 
**Mash**
I...see?

 
**Stheno**
As far as I can tell, the culprits most certainly are undead monsters.

 
**Stheno**
What do you say, everyone.
You just need to drive them out of that place.

 
**Stheno**
Can't you do it for me?
Doctor Romani?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wh-What? Me?
Why would you ask me? Ahem.

 
**Dr. Roman**
If it's the request from the beautiful goddess Stheno, I'd love to accept it, however&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
Back at the Second Singularity, you asked us something really unreasonable...

 
**Dr. Roman**
We just figured...
This time is going to be the same...

 
**Stheno**
Oh, what a shame.
Can't you do it, for me?

 
**Stheno**
Hey, Fujimaru. My master.
It's my request, you'd do it for me, right?

 
**Fou**
Fou, fou fooou.
Fou!

 
**Mash**
Just like the Doctor said, Senpai.
I'm sorry about her, but we have a duty.

 
**Mash**
Answer her properly.
Senpai, you are her master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course, goddess!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wretches are unforgivable!
 


---
 
**Mash**
S-Senpai!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Okay, if that's the case, I'll help you, too!!
Rayshift preparations! Complete! Looking good!

 
**Fou**
Fou!?

 
**Mash**
Even you, Doctor!
Can it be Stheno's Charm skill!?

 
**Stheno**
Heheh, can you not call it a skill, please?
It is exactly what I am.

 
**Stheno**
I am a goddess. I am a phenomenon born with the wish to captivate any and every hero.

 
**Stheno**
Like I said.
I'm sorry about it, but.

 
**Stheno**
Please, come with me.
I'm sure it will be a very fun event, so do your best.

 
**Mash**
I feel the phrases "very fun" and "do your best"
sound contrary to one another&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
Commence Rayshift!
Let's do it!

 
**Stheno**
Both of you, take care♪

 
**Mash**
Ah&ndash;!

 
**Mash**
...We're here.
This is the Mediterranean island we visited before...

 
**Mash**
How is Senpai doing...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What? Why are we on an island?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Weren't we in Chaldea?
 


---
 
**Mash**
Looks like you've regained sanity.
I'm glad.

 
**Mash**
We're on the Shaped Isle in the 1st Century, which we visited during the correction of the Second Singularity.

 
**Mash**
Senpai, this is due to you and the Doctor accepting to take on Stheno's "request."

 
**Mash**
So...Is there anything else I need to explain?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay, I remember now.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now that you mention it...
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
Let's go, guys!
According to Lady Stheno, she hid the treasure in a cave!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's that cave we entered before.
You know where it is. Well, be on your way!

 
**Fou**
Fou...

 
**Mash**
...Looks like Doctor is still charmed.
Guess there's no choice... but to go to the cave...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It cant be helped.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's complete it ASAP.
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai.
Let's finish this quickly.

 
**Mash**
Be careful, I feel there's a battle coming.

 
**Fou**
Fou, foou!

 
**Mash**
Speak of the devil, it looks like an enemy response!
Senpai, stay back!

 
**???**
Gegege...
I won't allow you go any further...

 
**Mash**
This magical energy feels like an undead monster...?
It is exactly like the information Stheno gave us&ndash;

 
**???**
All for our beautiful goddess Lady Stheno... As Lady Stheno commanded, we must protect her treasure!

 
**???**
We will risk our lives to eliminate the intruders!
Although we don't have any lives to risk!

 
**Mash**
!?

 
**Mash**
Instead of some wretches who dug up the treasure...
They sound like they're the ones protecting it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What? Then the real culprits are...
 
**Mash**
I-I'm sure that's it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's good to hear, no problem at all!
 
**Mash**
Not, not exactly&ndash;

 


---
 
**Mash**
"We are the culprits" here!
As I thought, Stheno was pulling a prank on us!

 
**???**
Go home, go home!
We won't give you the treasures, go home!

 
**???**
Woooo! Lady Stheno, woooo!
We won't forgive the intruders!!

 
**Mash**
Charm works even on undead monsters...
No, this is the power of a goddess born to be loved!

 
**Mash**
Senpai, they're coming!
We can't avoid combat!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
...Somehow, we managed to defeat them.
The battle is over.

 
**Mash**
We're almost in the deepest point of the cave, so what should we do, Senpai?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's take the treasure!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Tips for this errand!
 


---
 
**Mash**
You're... right.
We came this far, let's be thorough in playing the culprit.

 
**Mash**
A tiny part of me has thoughts about this.
Just a tiny part.

 
**???**
...I'm sorry.

 
**Mash**
!?

 
**F：???**
Seems my older sister is being unreasonable...
I'm sorry, I apologize for the inconvenience.

 
**Mash**
You are...
Servant Rider...Medusa.

 
**Mash**
Why are you here&ndash;Ah.
Don't tell me you too are...

 
**Medusa**
I'm sorry... I was also ordered by my older sister to get rid of the wretches.

 
**Medusa**
So, well, I'd just like to state that this isn't what I want to do.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...A battle?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can talk it out.
 


---
 
**Medusa**
I'm sorry, I can't resist.
I'm sure my sister is watching us right now!

 
**Medusa**
I won't ask you to forgive me.
But anyways, I will make you face death!

 
**Mash**
N-No, you can't!
Senpai, Medusa is pretty serious!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We have to do it!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If you ask me, it can't be helped!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Master!
...Commencing anti-Servant combat!


**--BATTLE--**

**Medusa**
...I lost.
I surrender, you can take the treasure.

 
**Fou**
Fou, fooou♪

 
**Mash**
The treasure chest.
What do you think is inside?

 
**Stheno**
Congratulations♪
Good job, you completed the trials I gave you, heroes♪

 
**Mash**
!?

 
**Fou**
F-Fou!?

 
**Mash**
...I-I see.
You Rayshifted together with us.

 
**Mash**
And then took the trouble to come here, to hide...
in the treasure chest...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What a mess!
 
**Mash**
...Yes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Our goddess!!
 
**Mash**
...Ah, Senpai, this again...

 


---
 
**Stheno**
As you can see, I was the treasure.Rejoice, Fujimaru. See, aren't you happy?

 
**Dr. Roman**
WOW! I'm really happy!
Wow, Lady Stheno!!

 
**Mash**
Well...

 
**Fou**
Foou...


<h2>Really, It's Not Impossible?</h2>

**Mash**
Hunt the wretches? ...Erm.
Not even us will fall for that twice.

 
**Stheno**
Don't misunderstand me. It's different from last time.
The purpose of this request is different from before.

 
**Stheno**
Specifically&ndash;

 
**Mash**
..."The purpose is different." I should've properly understood what that meant last time.

 
**Mash**
In other words, you want to once again rope us into one of your games?

 
**Stheno**
Oh, wonderful.
You are pretty smart, Mash.

 
**Mash**
No, um...
Your Charm skill isn't working on me...

 
**Mash**
If you really want to win me over, you shouldn't use the same logic as last time. Try a different&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
Understood, Goddess Stheno!
I, Romani Archaman, will risk my life to get it done!

 
**Mash**
Ah.

 
**Fou**
Fou, foou fou!!

 
**Mash**
Even you, Fou...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lady Goddess!
 
**Mash**
...Senpai, not again...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, brother.
 
**Mash**
...Oh, so you're fine this time?

 


---
 
**Mash**
...So Stheno, are we on another hunt on the Shaped Isle?

 
**Stheno**
Yes, you're right. But this time,
I really have an elaborate plan. Have fun♪

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's fun! I'm already having fun, our Goddess!
Let's do it Mash, Fujimaru! Right now!

 
**Mash**
(Noo...)

 
**Dr. Roman**
Commence Rayshift!!
Off you go to the 1st Century!!

 
**Stheno**
Be careful, both of you.
This quest may be a bit difficult to complete, perhaps?

 
**Mash**
...We're here again.
The Mediterranean island we've visited so many times...

 
**Mash**
Servant responses in the area... None detected.
But we can't drop our guards.

 
**Mash**
Based on what happened last time, we have to consider the possibility Stheno is here, too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's finish it ASAP.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The cave, right? Let's hurry.
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Let's go, guys!
According to Lady Stheno, she hid the treasure in a cave!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's that cave we entered before. You know where it is.
Well, be on your way!

 
**Mash**
Every last word is the same...
Doctor is completely taken by the Charm skill...

 
**Fou**
Fou...

 
**???**
Gegege...
I won't allow you to go any further...

 
**???**
All for our beautiful goddess Lady Stheno... As Lady Stheno commanded, we must protect her treasure!

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Fou**
...

 
**???**
They seem speechless against our determination!
Gegege...Then go home! Go on back home!

 
**???**
Go home, go home!
We won't give you the treasures, go home!

 
**???**
Woooo! Lady Stheno, woooo!
We won't forgive the intruders!!

 
**Mash**
...Identical, again...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do it, Mash!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can't waste their efforts!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Y-You're right. Understood, Master.
Your orders, please!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
I-It was different...from last time?
Instead of undead monsters, Chimera and Lamia...

 
**Mash**
She really changed her plans. Then, there's a chance the developments may change too.

 
**Mash**
Some Heroic Spirit stronger than Medusa?
But, what kind of Heroic Spirit&ndash;

 
**F：???**
...I'm sorry.

 
**Mash**
!!

 
**Medusa**
I am embarrassed to say, it's the same as last time.
As my older sister said, "they won't see it coming"...

 
**Mash**
Servant Rider...Medusa.
It is you, again.

 
**Medusa**
...Don't say it. It's hard for me, too.
She ordered me to get rid of the treasure-hunting wretches once and for all.

 
**Medusa**
What can I say, erm, this time, it will really be hard.
Do your best!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A battle, right?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have...nothing left to say.
 


---
 
**Medusa**
I'm sorry, many many times.
But, I won't ask you to forgive me.

 
**Medusa**
This time I'm really serious. Although I am on my sister's orders, but I'm still a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Medusa**
I can't afford to be defeated twice. Watch. This is the Gorgon-style Projection Killing Technique&mdash;

 
**Medusa**
Named "Snake Magic" by my older sister.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
S-She split up!?
 
**Medusa**
...Yes. Thank you very much for the expected reaction.
To be honest, it's embarrassing, so you helped me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
S-She's molting!?
 
**Medusa**
...I split up. It's obviously a split.
Molting? What do you think I am?

 
**Fou**
Fou, Foou...

 


---
 
**Mash**
Senpai, it's not the time to chit chat!
Visual impact aside, her power is real!

 
**Mash**
Multiple enemy Servants&mdash;
Intercepting at full power, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Medusa**
Is that all you've got?
I still have a lot of stamina left.

 
**Medusa**
Let's see. I still can molt&mdash;
N-No, I can split twice more, you know?

 
**Mash**
Hah, ah...I-It's endless, Senpai...
Really, I'm almost...

 
**???**
No, it is too early to give up,
Mash, Fujimaru. Hah♪

 
**Medusa**
B-Big Sister!?

 
**Mash**
Stheno!?

 
**Stheno**
Huhuhu. The star always arrives late, right? To clean up a little sister's mishap is an older sister's duty.

 
**Stheno**
To punish Medusa, who's needlessly big and violent, the Goddess Stheno makes her beautiful appearance♡

 
**Mash**
Wha...What?!
Stheno, are you on our side?

 
**Mash**
Aren't you protecting the treasure together with Medusa?

 
**Stheno**
What are you saying, Mash.
Right now I am Fujimaru's Servant.

 
**Stheno**
If someone is making Master suffer, I will get rid of her, mercilessly.

 
**Stheno**
Sadly, even if she is my own little sister!

 
**Medusa**
What, Big Sister!? The script was to summon Middle Sister, and all 3 of us would fight together, right!?

 
**Stheno**
Huhuhu. Did you honestly believe those words?
You really have to train much more, Medusa.

 
**Stheno**
Always doubt things that sound too good to be true, yes? Me, do something that would delight you? Such a thing&mdash;

 
**Stheno**
Has it ever happened, even once...!?

 
**Medusa**
Ah...You are soooooo right!
How convincing you are...!

 
**Stheno**
Come on, Fujimaru, let's fight!
I've never had so much fun fighting a Servant before!

 
**Mash**
...I do pity Medusa, but this must be the fate of those who meddle with goddesses...


**--BATTLE--**

**Medusa**
Uh...My split self's out of magical energy too...

 
**Medusa**
Extremely...
Tired...I used all I had...

 
**Medusa**
Big Sister doesn't care about how much magical energy she uses...

 
**Stheno**
Heheh.
Don't worry, I didn't consume any of mine.

 
**Stheno**
But it is really delightful.
My original self doesn't have the strength to fight...

 
**Stheno**
But I can fight if materialized as a Servant. A shame I didn't have this power during the Age of Myths.

 
**Mash**
...I-It was a really valuable experience.
Thank you very much, or rather...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm ti...red...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm somehow sleepy... Mash...
 


---
 
**Mash**
A-Aah, Senpai!? That's right... You used more magical energy than you do in usual combat!

 
**Medusa**
Yes. All the magical energy Big Sister used, it should have been all consumed from Fujimaru...

 
**Medusa**
So, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, if you die.

 
**Fou**
Fou, foou...!

 
**Mash**
Senpai, hold on!
Senpai...!

 
**Stheno**
Wait. I have to tell you before you pass out.
Unfortunately, there is no treasure chest this time.

 
**Stheno**
It'd be boring if it was the same every time, right?
I didn't want to disappoint you, but...

 
**Stheno**
I found a different treasure.
Sometimes it's good to fight like a tomboy.

 
**Stheno**
Well, just like what "Euryale" said.
...I can get used to this, heheh.

 
**Stheno**
So, I'll fight with everything I have next time, Master.
Please make a full use of my even more charming Noble Phantasm.

 
**Mash**
More important than that, Senpai!
Senpai, get a hold of yourself!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm...done...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sisters...Don't fight... Please...
 


---
 
**Mash**
Senpai!
