# Anne Bonny and Mary Read

<h2>Capture Captain Kidd's Treasure</h2>

**Mary**
Master, Mash, we're here.
Time to get off.

 
**Mash**
Okay Doctor, please check the communications system.

 
**Dr. Roman**
It looks fine. I can't believe we're looking for Captain Kidd's treasure! How exciting!

 
**Anne**
Do you feel in your element, Dr. Roman?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Well, my name is Romani Archaman.
"Roman" for short.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Adventures like looking for pirate treasures are part of what makes humans "romantic."

 
**Mary**
Just before Kidd was caught, he told a fellow pirate the whereabouts of his treasure.

 
**Mary**
But he was a pirate, you know?
Stories you hear from a drunk aren't all that trustworthy.

 
**Mary**
So nobody ever found where Captain Kidd's treasure lay.

 
**Mash**
How do you know where it is, Mary?

 
**Mary**
Oh, I found out later the treasure I previously gave up on belonged to Captain Kidd.

 
**Mash**
You gave up on it?

 
**Mary**
By chance, I ended up on this island a little before I became a pirate.

 
**Mary**
Since I was here, I decided to look around&ndash;
and I found the treasure.

 
**Mary**
...Yeah, I think it was treasure.
I only saw it from a distance.

 
**Anne**
At a distance?
You didn't get close?

 
**Mary**
...There was a reason I couldn't, you see.
Okay&ndash;Let's go!

 
**Anne**
Hehehe, I'm looking forward to this.

 
**Mary**
Um, first we have to get through this forest,
I think...

 
**Anne**
Oh my, oh my.
&ndash;There's something here.

 
**Pirate?**
Gweh...
Money... Ladies... Treasure...

 
**Pirate?**
Gweh...
Meat... Ale... Treasure...

 
**Mash**
I guess even pirate zombies are still pirates, huh...

 
**Mary**
Some things never change.
Now let's send them on their way to heaven.

 
**Anne**
Amen!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mary**
There we go.
Hmm... Hey, Master.

 
**Mary**
I feel a little bad for them...
Is it okay if I bury them?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course.
 


---
 
**Mary**
Thank you, Master.

 
**Anne**
You're very kind.
Come on, Mary. I'll help.

 
**Mash**
I'll help too.

 
**Mary**
Okay.

 
**Anne**
&ndash;If I may...

 
**Anne**
May the saints of heaven preserve them, may the dominions welcome them, may their souls be taken up to heaven&ndash;

 
**Anne**
Take pity upon us, and save our souls.
...Amen.

 
**Mary**
Thank you. Sorry for taking so long.
Most pirates end up thrown into the sea.

 
**Mary**
I thought it might be nice to actually have someone pray on their behalf for once.

 
**Mary**
Let's keep going!

 
**Mary**
Past these wilds is a cave at the bottom of the mountain.
That's where the treasure is.

 
**Anne**
I'm amazed no one found it if it's that easy.
Those pirates came so close.

 
**Mary**
Hmm, well it's probably&ndash;

 
**Mary**
Because of things like that wandering around.

 
**Anne**
Hehe, Mary.
You need to tell us stuff like that ahead of time.

 
**Mary**
Yeah, sorry.

 
**Mash**
P-Preparing for combat!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
...Whew. We got them.
What's a chimera doing on an island like this?

 
**Mash**
Those zombies back there acted a little strange too...

 
**Mash**
Um, Master...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have a bad feeling.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I really want to run.
 


---
 
**Mash**
Me too, yes.
Doctor? Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Zzz...
...Treasure...

 
**Mash**
Doctor Roman is asleep.
When we get back, we should punish him.

 
**Mary**
Okay, we're here!

 
**Mary**
Good,
looks like no one's been here but me.

 
**Anne**
So no one's touched it?
That's great.

 
**Mash**
Um, so Mary.
Why didn't you take the treasure?

 
**Mash**
Even if there was too much to carry,
you could've at least stuffed some jewels in a bag...

 
**Mary**
Oh, well you see...
“He” wouldn't let me.

 
**Anne**
He? Who?

 
**Mary**
Um... I think we'll see him any minute now...
Oh, there he is.

 
**Captain Kidd**
Curse ye...
Curse ye all...

 
**Captain Kidd**
None can have me treasure...
It's mine... It's Captain Kidd's treasure...

 
**Mash**
C-Captain Kidd...!
That's a ghost, isn't it?

 
**Mary**
That's right.
He was here, so I gave up.

 
**Mary**
In life, I had no way to fight a ghost.

 
**Mary**
Though thinking back, maybe I should've brought a silver sword, or a cross, or some holy water...

 
**Captain Kidd**
No one can have me treasure...
It's all mine... Not yours...

 
**Captain Kidd**
None can have!

 
**Mary**
Hi, I'm a pirate.
I've come to take your treasure.

 
**Anne**
I'm also a pirate.
That treasure's just rotting away here.

 
**Anne**
So, old man,
give it to me♪

 
**Mash**
...I'm very sorry, but that treasure is of no use to you now.

 
**Mash**
We're going to take it back and use it to help the living, the era, the world.

 
**Captain Kidd**
Curse...ye!
NONE CAN HAVE ME TREASURE!


**--BATTLE--**

**Captain Kidd**
Oooooh... Impossible!
M-Me treasure... Me treasure!

 
**Captain Kidd**
I-I-I!
Damn it... Oh, damn it all!

 
**Captain Kidd**
That's right! I'm dead!
I guess I've got no choice... But I hate it!

 
**Mash**
Whew... That was a hard fight.

 
**Mary**
Whew! Finally! Treasure time!

 
**Mash**
Y-Yeah!
This is a little exciting.

 
**Mary**
Um... The ghost was over here, so... Found it!
Look at all these chests!

 
**Mary**
Opening!

 
**Anne**
It'd be something if after all this, the punch line is
"Try Again" or "Your experience en route was your treasure."

 
**Mary**
...If that happens we'll bring his ghost back and torture him.

 
**Mary**
Okay... I'm opening it up.

 
**All**
...Hooray!


<h2>Treasure of the Knights Templar!</h2>

**Mash**
More treasure?

 
**Mary**
Yup. But it's not pirate treasure.
It's the treasure of the Knights Templar.

 
**Mash**
Oh, you mean the treasure that was hidden when the Templars were executed as heretics.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Pirates are definitely exciting!
This time around, I promise to fully monitor you guys!

 
**Anne**
I hope so. Mary, I'm amazed you knew about the Templars' treasure.

 
**Mary**
Remember how we went to all sorts of places during our pirating years?

 
**Anne**
Oh yes. When we got to port, you would always go out exploring.

 
**Mary**
It was hard for you, Anne, because men would always follow you around even just walking down the street.

 
**Anne**
Aww, you're so mean.

 
**Mary**
Hehehe. Um, Doctor.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah, what is it?

 
**Mary**
I know most of what there is to know about the Templars, but I'll let you explain.

 
**Mary**
It's too much of a hassle.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yay! She shoved all the tedious work to me! Oh, well That's what a back-end support job is about.

 
**Dr. Roman**
The Knights Templar were a group formed by clergymen to protect pilgrims traveling through the Holy Land.

 
**Dr. Roman**
One of their missions was to guard the treasures of knights and believers on pilgrimages.

 
**Dr. Roman**
As more pilgrims and crusaders started going to the Holy Land, the Templars gained more wealth to guard.

 
**Dr. Roman**
They ultimately functioned as a bank, including loaning money. They were even entrusted with an entire nation's fortune.

 
**Dr. Roman**
But the Kingdom of France, heavily in debt, captured and tortured many of them.

 
**Dr. Roman**
France wanted to get rid of their debts and take the money.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Even though they canceled out their debts, a majority of the fortune France sought disappeared into the shadows.

 
**Dr. Roman**
The Templars are even said to have possessed a Holy Grail, but everything's been shrouded in mystery.

 
**Mary**
I heard the story from an old man who said he was a descendant of one of the Templars.

 
**Mash**
Um, can we trust him?

 
**Mary**
I'm not sure. He was drunk, and he kept switching between yelling and crying.

 
**Mary**
But the story itself seemed sensible.
From what he said...

 
**Mary**
The Templars had heard from their spies that their lives were in danger.

 
**Mary**
So they loaded their treasure on a ship and hid it somewhere. Everyone involved in the transport was killed on the spot.

 
**Mary**
Their plan was to hide the treasure until the Templars could rebuild themselves.

 
**Mary**
The old man's ancestor left the Templars so he wouldn't be caught. Even the Templars didn't know where he hid.

 
**Mary**
But the Templars never recovered. His ancestors continued to pass down the word to wait for the Templars' reformation.

 
**Mary**
After about four centuries, they stopped caring.
He sold me the story for a drink...

 
**Anne**
Sounds pretty sketchy to me.

 
**Mary**
Right. Sorry if it doesn't pan out.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No problem.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It'll be fine since it'll be fun.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
That's right. It's getting to the treasure that's the fun part. There isn't much we could do with the treasure as we are now, anyway.

 
**Dr. Roman**
But it can boost our QP, and maybe we'll find something interesting! Let's go!

 
**Mary**
The old man said it was back here.
But this is just a stone wall.

 
**Anne**
Was our lead a dud?

 
**Mary**
Sorry...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's too early to say.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't give up.
 


---
 
**Mash**
No, wait a second. There's a tiny bloodstain on this wall.

 
**Mary**
Oh, you're right. Same with the others... I wonder why?

 
**Mash**
Doctor, please investigate the wall in front of us.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Roger. Investigating now. Hmm... I'm detecting a strong magical energy reading from the wall.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Anne, try blasting it with your gun.

 
**Dr. Roman**
You're a Servant now.
Your bullet should get some response.

 
**Anne**
Understood. Here I go!

 
**Mash**
The wall started to move.
These are... Golems!?

 
**Mary**
Woah. Come to think of it, I heard something about the Templars using black magic...

 
**Anne**
Was there such a tale?
Well, let's just beat these guys.


**--BATTLE--**

**Dr. Roman**
The golems are all down, but I'm seeing more enemy responses up ahead.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Proceed with caution.

 
**Mary**
Sure thing, Doctor.

 
**Mash**
This makes me think the old man's story might be true. Let's go!

 
**Mary**
Whew! This side's clear, too.

 
**Anne**
Security's tight. I'm getting excited.

 
**Mary**
We probably won't find a Grail.

 
**Mash**
Maybe we will.

 
**Mash**
That is to say, I don't mean the Holy Grails we recover.
I mean the true Holy Grail of legend.

 
**Mary**
That would be an adventure indeed.
Master, do you want the Holy Grail?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I want a future.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I want peace.
 


---
 
**Mary**
I see. You aren't very greedy.
Or maybe you are.

 
**Mary**
The future or peace... Those are really big wishes, so you probably don't have time to be thinking about smaller wishes.

 
**Dr. Roman**
As the guy paying for everyone's salary, that would be great. That aside, I'm picking up some life-form signals. Be careful!

 
**Mash**
Doctor, a fair salary is an absolute necessity to keep talented people around. Let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mary**
Whew. Homunculi and zombies.
Were the zombies people killed by the Templars?

 
**Dr. Roman**
If that is true, they must have been there a long time. Let's pray their souls find rest.

 
**Mary**
We're almost to the end.
The treasure should be there!

 
**Anne**
Wow...

 
**Mary**
Ah...

 
**Mash**
This is...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Treasure!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mounds of riches!
 


---
 
**Mary**
We did it, Master!

 
**Dr. Roman**
H-Hold it! Hold it! I-In that cave, I'm picking up a life-form signal that we have all become very familiar with!

 
**Mash**
Some say the Templars used black magic, others that they didn't.

 
**Mary**
Maybe they were, maybe they weren't.
I'm sure there are tons of stories like that.

 
**Anne**
But would you normally go to these lengths?

 
**Dr. Roman**
A dragon!? Um... I can only say...well... F-Fight!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mary**
We won. Victory!

 
**Anne**
Whew! I'm exhausted.
I can't wait to take a bath.

 
**Mash**
It's pretty standard for a dragon to guard treasure, but I didn't expect the Templars to use one.

 
**Dr. Roman**
They're less like Templars and more like Temp-LATES, am I right?

 
**Mash**
Fou, when we get back, bite Dr. Roman on the nose.
As hard as you can.

 
**Fou**
Fourururu!

 
**Dr. Roman**
I-I'm sorry! I thought that was a good one!

 
**Mary**
Anyway, this is a huge pile of treasure, Master.
Yeah, I like it.

 
**Mary**
There's enough money here to easily buy a country or two. Any Grails?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Nope, I'm not picking up anything. But I do see magical energy here and there in the treasure.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Can you search for me?

 
**Mary**
Hmm, maybe it's this?This crystal skull.

 
**Dr. Roman**
A crystal skull!
That's a rare treasure indeed!

 
**Anne**
What about... this?
It's a set of weapons and armor.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Probably used by the Templars. Magically it's nothing special, but it's valuable as a treasure.

 
**Mary**
The right thing to do would be to return these to the Templars' followers, but we're pirates, so we'll just keep it, thank you very much.

 
**Anne**
Hehehe, this is also for saving the world.

 
**Mary**
Yup! Let's make good use of this to save the world. Right, Master?
