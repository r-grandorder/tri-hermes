<h2>Curse of the Argo</h2>

**Circe**
...(Turns page)

 
**Atalante**
...(Munch, munch)

 
**Mash**
Um...

 
**Mash**
(What's going on here...?)

 
**Mash**
(Why are Circe and Atalante lounging around on Senpai's bed...?)

 
**Mash**
(Well...maybe not exactly lounging so much as relaxing...)

 
**Mash**
(Circe is reading a book...and Atalante seems to be lost in some video...)

 
**Circe**
...(Turns page)

 
**Circe**
Holy crap, seriously...?
What's wrong with people these days...?

 
**Circe**
...Hey, can you grab those for me?

 
**Atalante**
Absolutely not. (Toss)

 
**Circe**
Thanks!
Man, these sticky note things are great.

 
**Atalante**
...Hey. What was that person's name again?

 
**Circe**
Huh? How the hell should I know?
I'm the Queen Witch, remember?

 
**Circe**
Maybe Hermaphroditus?
Oh, I bet it's Clytemnestra.

 
**Atalante**
That's it. I could not remember for the life of me.
...Mm.

 
**Circe**
What is this stuff?

 
**Atalante**
Apple chips. They are quite good.
If you eat two at once, it changes the flavor.

 
**Circe**
Oh please, don't be ridiculous.
There's no way that could... (Munch)

 
**Circe**
Whoa... You're right. (Munch, munch)

 
**Circe**
Here Mash, you've gotta try these. You get a whole different flavor if you eat two at a time!

 
**Mash**
O-okay, thank you.
I'd be glad to try some.

 
**Mash**
(Munch, crunch...)

 
**Mash**
(...I know I have no real basis for thinking this, but...)

 
**Mash**
(...is this what most teenage girls do when they spend time together?)

 
**Atalante**
...You there, witch.
What spell tome are you reading?

 
**Circe**
It's Queen Witch.

 
**Atalante**
What a garish cover. The cover's array of pink fluorescent hearts makes my eyes water.

 
**Atalante**
And why is it so thick?
Is it meant to be used as a bludgeon?

 
**Circe**
Remember that weird field trip we went on the other day? I just happened to find this when we stopped by that convenience store. Hehehe!

 
**Circe**
Check out all the bonus stuff they give you with it!

 
**Circe**
Matching aprons, adorable oven mitts,
and a selfie stick with Cupid wings!

 
**Circe**
And...ooh, I'm sensing a lot of magical energy from this special marriage registration in the back!

 
**Atalante**
I see. Good for you.
Enjoy your reading, then.

 
**Nitocris**
...Circe! Get up already!

 
**Mash**
Oh... Hello, Nitocris.
Thank you for helping Senpai out.

 
**Nitocris**
Of course. Though I must say, I didn't expect to come back to such a sad state of affairs.

 
**Nitocris**
How can you still call yourself a teacher,
wallowing about like a pig?

 
**Nitocris**
It's deplorable... All the other witches from the great Age of Gods would be ashamed of you!

 
**Circe**
Ugh, lay offa me! What are you, my mother?

 
**Nitocris**
O-of course not.
M-more of a conscientious younger sister.

 
**Nitocris**
At any rate, I know Medea already talked to you about this too...

 
**Nitocris**
...but make sure you fill out the Caster bulletin and put it back where it belongs like we asked you to!

 
**Circe**
Yeah, yeah, I got it already.

 
**Nitocris**
Hmph...

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Who's turning into a pig now?


---
 
**Circe**
 
Aah! (Frenzied cleaning)

 
**Mash**
Oh, hello, Senpai. We were just changing shifts.
You have a break now too, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You okay, Circe?
 
**Circe**
H-hey there, Piglet! I'm doing better than okay!
What a coincidence, running into you here!

 
**Circe**
If you're tired, I've got some kykeon all ready to go for an afternoon snack!

 
**Circe**
I've also got a remedy that'll double your fatigue now but make it all go away like magic in a few days if you like.

 
**Atalante**
When are you going to figure out that administering it in small doses only ends up increasing your target's poison resistance?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everything okay, Circe?
 
**Atalante**
I believe she is panicking about being compared to all the new Greek additions that have shown up as of late.

 
**Atalante**
Please do not be too harsh with her.

 
**Circe**
Stop that! Don't you look away like that just 'cause you're feeling awkward, Mash!

 


---
 
**Mash**
H-here, Senpai, why don't you have a seat?
I'll go make some tea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Mash.


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What're you watching there, Atalante?


---
 
**Mash**
...I couldn't help but notice you've been watching it very intently.

 
**Mash**
I also noticed you tearing up at times,
so I wasn't sure what to say...

 
**Atalante**
O-oh... This?

 
**Atalante**
This is an old video I found in Chaldea's library.

 
**Atalante**
It is so painful to watch that it took my breath away.

 
**Atalante**
It tells the story of children still too young to attend school who are forced by their cruel parents to go on a trip to procure supplies.

 
**Atalante**
It has everything. Trials, tribulations, tears,
twists, triumph... I could watch it forever.

 
**Atalante**
Jason's journey to find the Golden Fleece was nothing compared to what these poor children endured!

 
**Mash**
That's...really saying something.

 
**Circe**
Aw come on, that's not fair to Jason.

 
**Circe**
You should know that, Atalante,
seeing how you were one of the Argonauts.

 
**Atalante**
Hmph... You have always been too soft when it comes to sailors.

 
**Atalante**
That is why you are always so put upon.

 
**Circe**
Ghh...

 
**Mash**
Haha...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Were Circe and Atalante always such good friends?


---
 
**Mash**
...Good question.
It does seem like they get along very well.

 
**Circe**
...

 
**Atalante**
...Did you hear that?

 
**Circe**
Well, maybe they have a point.

 
**Circe**
We didn't have a lot of contact in our own time,
but that might have been for the best.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't suppose you'd tell us about the time you two met?


---
 
**Mash**
A story from Greek mythology?
I'd love to hear that as well.

 
**Circe**
Hmm. A story about the good old days, huh?

 
**Atalante**
I... I would rather...

 
**Circe**
Fine with me! Anything for my darling Piglet!

 
**Circe**
Though it was nothing grand enough to be recorded in poems or stories passed down through the ages.

 
**Circe**
Let's see... Our story begins long before the Trojan War was a glimmer in anyone's eye...


**--ARROW--**

		– Aeaea Island –

 
**Piglets**
Oink, oiiink! (Squealing and sobbing)

 
**Circe**
There, there. I know it hurt.
You must've been so scared. But it's all okay now.

 
**Jason**
Circe, tell me, what business does a famed witch have with us?

 
**Circe**
A warning! What else!?
Listen up, Jason, captain of the Argo!

 
**Circe**
As long as you're staying on this island, you're free to fish anything you want from the sea, or to pick any of the fruit of this land.

 
**Circe**
But do not lay so much as a finger on this island's animals!

 
**Circe**
Remember, this island is my domain. If you, or any of your Argonauts, should break my rules...

 
**Circe**
...you'll be lucky to escape with your lives,
let alone a repaired boat!

 
**Jason**
...Duly noted.

 
**Jason**
Damn, and here I thought I'd finally get some steak for the first time in ages... Guess it's back to wyvern jerky.

 
**Jason**
Hey! You two!
Put those pigs back where you found them!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Huh? Are you talking to me?
 
**Jason**
That's right.
You're Fujimaru and...Mashaea, was it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Long time no see, Jason.
 
**Jason**
Huh?

 
**Jason**
The hell're you talking about, creep?
We just saw each other this morning.

 
**Jason**
That goes for you too, Mashaea,
or whatever your name was. Got it?

 


---
 
**Mash**
...Mashaea? Senpai, when did we become sailors?

 
**Mash**
Does this mean we've joined Jason and become members of the Argonauts now?

 
**Atalante**
That is correct.
Still...it is quite a shame...

 
**Atalante**
Had I known what would happen,
I would have strangled this prey on the spot...

 
**Piglets**
O-oiiink!

 
**Circe**
So... You're the one who set a trap for my precious piglets!

 
**Circe**
...Wait. Why would you even do that after I made some kykeon to welcome you all!?

 
**Atalante**
How stupid do you think we must be to accept a gift from the witch of Aeaea Island at face value?

 
**Circe**
Hehe, I believe you mean QUEEN Witch!

 
**Jason**
Exactly.

 
**Jason**
We didn't sail all this way just to have you poison us and make off with our treasure.

 
**Circe**
Hey, I wouldn't do that! For one thing, I'd never lay a hand on my own brother's treasure.

 
**Mash**
Treasure...? Do you mean the king of Colchis's most prized possession?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way... The Golden Fleece!?


---
 
**Jason**
None other.

 
**Jason**
After everything my crew and I have been through, you'd better believe we're going to be on our guard.

 
**Jason**
Though I guess it's no surprise you two wouldn't know that, since you only just joined us.

 
**Mash**
...So then, we must be in the middle of the Argo's voyage to bring the Golden Fleece back from Colchis.

 
**Mash**
As I recall, during that voyage, Zeus got angry and hurled a tremendous storm at the Argo...

 
**Atalante**
Correct.

 
**Atalante**
Med&ndash;Queen Medea killing her younger brother, Prince Apsyrtus, was the catalyst for his wrath.

 
**Atalante**
Once he learned of this crime, Zeus flew into a rage.

 
**Atalante**
He struck the Argo with lightning, battered it with great waves, and plunged it into a storm so fierce the keel was nearly torn apart.

 
**Jason**
The only reason we managed to barely survive was my mastery of the sail and rudder...

 
**Jason**
...as well as the courage of my loyal Argonauts.

 
**Atalante**
...I expect Castor and Pollux's pleas must have reached Zeus's ears.

 
**Circe**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...So what happened to Medea?


---
 
**Jason**
She's inside the Argo's wreck over on the beach.

 
**Jason**
She shut herself up in the cabin after she killed Apsyrtus and hasn't spoken to anyone since.

 
**Jason**
The only exception she will make is for our rostrum oak from Dodona.

 
**Medea Lily**
...

 
**Circe**
The oak from Dodona... You mean the talking wood that's only found in the land of Zeus's oracle?

 
**Circe**
So she'd rather talk to a piece of lumber than you or your crew? Aren't you ashamed of that!?

 
**Jason**
...Ohhh, right. Technically, you're my aunt-in-law, aren't you, Circe?

 
**Jason**
And here I still haven't thanked you properly.

 
**Circe**
If you're gonna call me your aunt,
then you'd better take good care of Medea.

 
**Circe**
...I wouldn't have even let you near Aeaea Island if she hadn't been on your ship.

 
**Circe**
Zeus will eventually get over his rage,
but the Argo will still be cursed.

 
**Circe**
It's only a matter of time until you run into more foul weather, or get stranded somewhere else. Just look how beat-up your ship is.

 
**Circe**
How many times have you wrecked that thing? Forget repairing it; you should just throw it away and find a new one.

 
**Jason**
Wha...!? Don't be ridiculous!
I can't do that!

 
**Jason**
The Argo is my ship! It's going to guide me back to my home of Thessaly!

 
**A：???**
...Now, now, easy there, Jason.

 
**Mash**
...?
Who's that...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(A young man in impressive clothing just showed up...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Is that a human...or a demigod? Who is that?)


---
 
**???**
If you continue such drastic repairs, your ship will, in essence, become a new vessel.

 
**???**
Should that come to pass,
would you still call it your beloved Argo?

 
**Jason**
Of course I could. It's the only ship worthy of being with me for my whole life.

 
**Jason**
I won't let it go no matter what,
not even if it gets smashed from bow to stern.

 
**???**
Of course that's your answer.
I suppose that is one way for a hero of the sea to live...

 
**???**
...Now then. Circe, beautiful ruler of Aeaea Island, goddess of mercy with the wisdom and providence of Artemis...

 
**???**
...I apologize for not introducing myself sooner.
It is a genuine pleasure to make your acquaintance.

 
**Circe**
Oh? Well now, I can't remember the last time someone paid me the proper respects. Hehe.

 
**Circe**
I wonder who that is?
No...hang on...

 
**Circe**
Those Ionian looks...
That tropical accent...

 
**Circe**
And that expensive himation with the pattern reserved strictly for royalty...!

 
**Circe**
I know...who you are.
I think I know your name, too...

 
**Circe**
You're...the king of Athens!

 
**???**
...Indeed I am. I'm honored that you know of me. But right now, I'm just Jason's friend and fellow Argonaut.

 
**Circe**
Well no wonder the Argo's cursed if it's got guys like you on board!

 
**Circe**
I...I can't believe you have the guts to show your face before me, Theseus!

 
**Mash**
Theseus...!
The heroic young king of Athens...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's been on board the Argo this whole time?
 
**Mash**
I-I believe so.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've heard that name before.
 
**Mash**
Yes... I'm sure you have, Senpai.

 


---
 
**Mash**
He's the hero who made his way through the great labyrinth of Crete and defeated the Minotaur.

 
**Circe**
A hero, huh... Yeah, maybe.

 
**Circe**
Theseus did help my sister, Pasiphaë,
wrap up one of her loose moral ends.

 
**Circe**
After he escaped from the labyrinth, I heard he took her daughter, my niece, Princess Ariadne...

 
**Circe**
...who was, I would add, the spitting image of her mother, as his bride.

 
**Circe**
And yet, for some reason, I haven't heard anything more about Ariadne after that happened. Not a peep.

 
**Circe**
Instead, all I've heard is how the king of Athens recently welcomed a new queen to his palace.

 
**Circe**
...Why is that, Theseus? What was so wrong with Ariadne that she couldn't be your queen?

 
**Theseus**
...I still love Ariadne, even now.
I'm more grateful to her than you know.

 
**Theseus**
But unfortunately, she had no intention of bearing me an heir.

 
**Theseus**
As a man, I could accept that choice and respect it.

 
**Theseus**
But as the king of Athens,
this created a problem that I had to solve.

 
**Theseus**
Much as I wish it weren't, that is part of my kingly duty. I am so sorry.

 
**Circe**
...Ghh...

 
**Circe**
I swear! What is it about my family that makes heroes everywhere just wanna mess with us?

 
**Jason**
...That's enough, Theseus.
Step down. I'm plenty calm now.

 
**Jason**
I trust you understand why I didn't want you and Circe running into each other?

 
**Theseus**
Yes, I do, Jason.
I'm sorry for overstepping my bounds.

 
**Theseus**
I'll get back to supervising repairs on the Argo.

 
**Atalante**
...Circe, Queen Witch, it is too soon for you to lose hope and curse us.

 
**Atalante**
You have Medea.

 
**Atalante**
She speaks of you often, and clearly has fond memories of you as her teacher.

 
**Atalante**
And right now, Medea wants nothing more than to see the Argo's voyage completed.

 
**Atalante**
I know she is not here asking you for help,
but I also know that is what she wants.

 
**Jason**
Indeed. Atalante is absolutely right, Circe.

 
**Jason**
So I ask you now, as the leader of the Argonauts:
please, help us return to the sea.

 
**Jason**
For my wife's&ndash;for Medea's&ndash;sake as much as ours.

 
**Circe**
...

 
**Circe**
...I guess my bloodline was just fated to be the plaything of gods and heroes alike.

 
**Atalante**
I actually did not care a great deal about all of that.

 
**Atalante**
I only wished that Medea's twisted romance would hurry and end, so she may find happiness again.

 
**Mash**
...So then, Circe did go on to honor Jason's request and help the Argonauts.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm impressed Jason pulled that off. Talk about a model hero.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, that's how you shamelessly sweet talk someone intogiving you what you want. Good to know.


---
 
**Mash**
So...what happened next?

 
**Mash**
According to myth, the Argo continued its voyage for quite some time after that, right?

 
**Atalante**
Indeed. And that is exactly what happened.

 
**Atalante**
However...Circe was dead set on getting Medea to resolve the situation for herself.

 
**Atalante**
She kept trying to wake her up to the disaster she had invited and face up to it.

 
**Atalante**
...At least, that is what you were trying to do, was it not?

 
**Circe**
...Yeah, it was. Not that it did any good.

 
**Circe**
My former pupil refused to see me,
even after I came to the Argo in person.

 
**Circe**
She refused to open up, and wouldn't let anyone besides Jason come near her.

 
**Circe**
Honestly, I'm not even sure Jason's attempts to console her got through.

 
**Circe**
Eventually, I just ended up waving my wand to dispel the Argo's curse.


**--ARROW--**

**Circe**
...All right, listen up, brave Argonauts.

 
**Circe**
Let's go over the dispelling ritual one more time.

 
**Circe**
This elixir I whipped up will make ephemeral concepts corporeal for a short while.

 
**Circe**
Once you sprinkle it over the hull, it'll make its curse something you can touch&ndash;or, more to the point, hit.

 
**Circe**
If you can defeat the curse before the elixir's effects run out, the Argo should then be free of it for good.

 
**Circe**
But be warned: if you fail to defeat it, it'll get even stronger and come back to haunt this ship with a vengeance.

 
**Atalante**
So the curse will take the form of a monster, huh.
I suppose it being only one monster would be too much to hope for?

 
**Jason**
If not, that's where Theseus'll come in!

 
**Jason**
Now that Heracles is gone, there's no one else on the crew who can match his might. Haaahaha!

 
**Circe**
Are you nuts?
I'd rather die than ask Theseus for help.

 
**Circe**
So, before it comes to that...I'm willing to lend a hand myself.

 
**Jason**
You? For real?
Are you sure you even know how to fight, grandma?

 
**Circe**
You're the last person I want to hear that from!

 
**Theseus**
I think it's wonderful that you'll be joining the fray.

 
**Theseus**
I only hope that the ship doesn't get wrecked again now that it's almost repaired.

 
**Theseus**
Also there're some ominous clouds making their way toward this island. If the seas start acting up, there's no telling what might happen to the ship.

 
**Circe**
It's the curse pulling those storm clouds here. How is that a surprise? Of course the gods aren't gonna be thrilled about this, you jagoff.

 
**Circe**
Nonetheless...I swear to Hecate that your sails will be filled with wind again.

 
**Circe**
Now come on, Jason, grab your sword and help us!

 
**Jason**
Grab my sword? I've got my hands full just keeping Medea's cabin safe!

 
**Circe**
Are you serious!? This is YOUR ship! You are sincerely dedicated to being a complete dick, aren't you?

 
**Atalante**
It is nothing new for him.
If any monsters try to escape, I will take care of them.

 
**Atalante**
Fujimaru, Mashaea, I would appreciate your help as well.

 
**Mash**
R-right...!
I'd be glad to!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't think I'll be any help whatsoever, but I'll do what I can.
 
**Circe**
...Good to hear.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I'm worried about Medea.
 
**Circe**
...

 


---
 
**Jason**
There, now that I've finished off this bottle of wine,
let's get to the beach and do this thing!

 
**Jason**
Okay Argonauts, go forth and get our home back!


**--BATTLE--**

**Atalante**
Haaa!

 
**Atalante**
There, that takes care of all the monsters on the deck!

 
**Atalante**
Now we just need to take care of the ones in the hold. What are your orders, Jason!?

 
**Mash**
Well, uh, I'm afraid...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jason got hit by a barrel of apples and knocked out...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Jason died a hero's death in defense of his ship, I hear.
 


---
 
**Atalante**
Again, hmm. Very well then,
we will just have to finish this ourselves.

 
**Atalante**
Circe...?
...Ah...

 
**Circe**
...So, you've finally shown yourself before me.

 
**Mash**
Huh? Medea's...commanding the curse monsters...?

 
**Atalante**
What... What is the meaning of this, Medea...!?

 
**Medea Lily**
Hello, Circe, Atalante... Did you come here to laugh at me while I was bawling my eyes out?

 
**Medea Lily**
Or perhaps to admonish me for my sins...?

 
**Circe**
...Medea...

 
**Circe**
...No, nothing like that.
I'm here to celebrate this new chapter in your life.

 
**Medea Lily**
New chapter...?

 
**Circe**
Just as I will never again be seen merely as a priestess...

 
**Circe**
...Medea, you too have become a woman to be feared as a witch.

 
**Circe**
So of course you're gonna mess other people's lives up something fierce. You can't help it! You're a witch!

 
**Circe**
Go ahead and seduce any man you want,
then toss him aside when you're done!

 
**Circe**
That's one of the best parts of being a witch, you know. You should be proud that you're worth that.

 
**Circe**
Although, I gotta say...you don't look all that happy about this to me.

 
**Circe**
I can see you're smiling while we stand here, but I can also tell you're crying on the inside, and I have to say I don't like that.

 
**Medea Lily**
...

 
**Medea Lily**
These curses come from me...
They're my sins made manifest.

 
**Medea Lily**
So I'll take them with me when I go.

 
**Atalante**
I cannot let you get away with that, Medea.
Those curses will not stop until they sink this ship.

 
**Medea Lily**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Medea...


---
 
**Circe**
(Sigh)... How many times did I tell you to learn the medicinal arts too, Medea?

 
**Circe**
Hecate's medicinal arts don't just heal the body.
They have a powerful effect on the heart, too.

 
**Circe**
But only if you spent time devoting yourself to the study of how the heart works while learning them.

 
**Circe**
If you do that, it's a wonderful way to tame the monsters lurking in your heart.

 
**Circe**
For a disciple of Hecate, I gotta say...I'm disappointed in myself for releasing such a half-assed witch into the world.

 
**Circe**
...This is exactly why I didn't want to take on an apprentice in the first place.

 
**Circe**
But, now that we're here, I guess this scuffle's as good a time as any to teach you one last lesson!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
...(Gulp)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So...what happened to the Argo then?


---
 
**Circe**
Nothing, Piglet. There were no more mishaps, happenings, or even minor inconveniences worth mentioning after that.

 
**Circe**
The Argonauts defeated every monster on board the ship and dispelled Medea's self-destructive curse.

 
**Circe**
After that, I thanked them, threw them a big kykeon farewell party, and sent them on their merry way.

 
**Circe**
And you already know the rest from the myth.

 
**Circe**
All right, you have your own stuff to take care of, right, Master? Go on then, get out of here.

 
**Circe**
That's it for today's kykeon party.

 
**Atalante**
...

 
**Mash**
Um, Circe? I really do appreciate you telling us that story, but...

 
**Mash**
...you're sitting on Senpai's bed...

 
**Mash**
Hey! Where do you think you're going with that pillow!? Put it back! Don't you click your tongue at me!

 
**Circe**
...(Sulk)

 
**Atalante**
I have rarely seen your lips so loose, falcon witch.

 
**Atalante**
I never expected you to discuss your past in such detail.

 
**Circe**
...Well, so what? Felt like it, so I did.

 
**Circe**
That's all water under the bridge for Medea and me anyway.

 
**Circe**
Hm...? What is it?
Why're you looking at me like that?

 
**Atalante**
Let us say...hypothetically...

 
**Atalante**
...you encountered the hero of your dreams once more. What would you do?

 
**Circe**
Wh-what kind of stupid question is that?

 
**Atalante**
...I am merely curious.
I have no real experience in romance myself.

 
**Atalante**
And as such, I cannot imagine what it is to be driven mad by it, as Medea was.

 
**Atalante**
Granted, the odds of that happening are vanishingly small, and so likely not worth considering...

 
**Circe**
Hehe, oh, I wouldn't say that.

 
**Circe**
I'm not the same old Circe I used to be. You don't really think I'd make the same mistake all over again, do you?

 
**Circe**
In fact, you've got the whole thing back asswards. He's the one that would end up falling for me, the Queen Witch.

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Who's falling for who now?

**Circe**
Bwaaa!

 
**Circe**
P-Piglet! Where the hell'd you come from!?
Don't scare me like that!

 
**Circe**
Huh? You're just going to the bathroom? You can't go in your own room 'cause you feel like someone's watching you?

 
**Circe**
K-kind of an overshare, isn't it!?
Go on, get out of here!

 
**Circe**
...Phew...

 
**Atalante**
So, you would make him fall in love with you...
You are nothing if not confident, witch of Aeaea.

 
**Circe**
...Hell yeah I am!

 
**Circe**
Hehe. Still, that said...

 
**Circe**
If I'd just stayed a hermit out on my island...I'd never have learned to be so recklessly confident.

 
**Circe**
So I'm grateful to Pig&ndash;I mean, Master for that.

 
**Atalante**
Hmm. That's nice. (Munch, munch)

 
**Circe**
Wha...

 
**Circe**
Hey, you're the one who started all this.
Isn't it kinda rude for you to just shut down like that?

 
**Circe**
I guess you didn't really care after all...

 
**Atalante**
...?

 
**Medea Lily**
...The Oak of Dodona once told me something while it let me listen to the ocean wind through its knothole.

 
**Medea Lily**
It said love would paddle in from far overseas and drop an anchor deep within your heart.

 
**Circe**
...Hmm...
A divine prophecy, huh.

 
**Circe**
Whoever heard of a piece of wood being an oracle? Is it a dryad with a direct hotline to the gods or something?

 
**Circe**
Anyway, that said...I hope it's right! Wherever the tree gets its info from, I am definitely a fan of this prophecy.

 
**Circe**
I know there's a much better guy for you out there.

 
**Circe**
Jason might have the makings of a hero,
but he's got a long way to go before&ndash;

 
**Medea Lily**
Um, Auntie...?
That prophecy? It was about you.

 
**Circe**
Bwa?

 
**Circe**
...H-hey, tree, who told you you could go making predictions about my future, huh!?

 
**Medea Lily**
The Oak also said...

 
**Medea Lily**
...that a hero you would never forget would come visit Aeaea Island one day.

 
**Circe**
...Stop that. I'm the Queen Witch, remember?

 
**Circe**
This isn't funny. I'm a disciple of Hecate herself.
No way I'm letting Zeus pull that kind of stunt!

 
**Medea Lily**
...Of course.

 
**Circe**
Hey, Medea, look!

 
**Circe**
The sailors are praying to Zephyr as we speak.
It won't be long before you set sail again.

 
**Medea Lily**
...I know.

 
**E：Circe**
...Well, my defiant disciple, this is the last piece of advice I have for you.

 
**E：Circe**
Stay on my island.

 
**E：Circe**
The Argo's curse is gone.
I've washed away its stain.

 
**E：Circe**
The Argonauts can handle the rest of their journey without you.

 
**E：Circe**
And nobody from Colchis would ever come looking for you here.

 
**Medea**
I'm sorry, Auntie, but I can't do that.

 
**Medea**
You saw what happened for yourself, right?
Jason needs me.

 
**Medea**
Besides...

 
**Medea**
...I don't want to be just a footnote in history like Ariadne.

 
**E：Circe**
...I see. Well then, I guess there's nothing left to say but goodbye.

 
**Medea**
I guess not.
Take care of yourself, Auntie.

 
**Medea**
Even though I'll be staying on, I pray you'll find the kind of love that would make me insanely jealous.

 
**E：Circe**
...Hehe.

 
**E：Circe**
You never change, do you!
