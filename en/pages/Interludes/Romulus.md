# Romulus 

<h2>Guardian of Septem is Here</h2>

**Nero**
Umu!
My Rome is alive and full with people as ever today!

 
**Nero**
We no longer face the threat of the United Empire, smiles have been back on Rome's, my dear Romans' faces.

 
**Nero**
How wonderful. I'm in a great mood today.
Indeed&ndash;

 
**Nero**
It's sad I won't see Fujimaru and Mash ever again, but I'm the emperor of Rome!

 
**Nero**
As long as my people have smiles on their faces, all I need is to reign over and govern Rome with unlimited love!

 
**Nero**
My talent has no limit, and neither does my love.
The applause of roses will always resound in Rome!

 
**Nero**
I'm so excited!
Which song should I sing today?

 
**Romans**
Oh, I see her Imperial Majesty over there!
She's as bright as Apollo, and as beautiful as Venus!

 
**Romans**
Long live her Majesty!
Hurray for Emperor Nero Claudius!

 
**Nero**
Umu.
Keep on, I'll allow for the applause.

 
**Nero**
If there's one thing to be added, I'm also as talented in art as a Muse.

 
**Nero**
Now let me sing!
Young girls, come here and hold flowers!

 
**Nero**
Honor of Imperium is here! I'll sing with my sweet voice to people throughout the capital, no, the whole land of Rome.

 
**Romans**
Oh, wow!
Look, her Imperial Majesty is about to sing!

 
**Romans**
We're blessed, but you have to put up with it!
Don't lose your concentration, otherwise you won't last!

 
**Nero**
Hehe, even the people passing by are excited!
I'm so happy. This is the Rome I love!

 
**Nero**
...Whew!
That was a great recital.

 
**Nero**
But those orchestra folks that rushed to join.
Isn't their performance a bit too loud?

 
**Nero**
Didn't it drown out my sweet voice and block my singing from reaching my people?

 
**Nero**
I understand that they get excited, but I need them to remember to be patient.

 
**Nero**
Anyway, I spent the whole morning singing. I should work on some official business in the afternoon&ndash;

 
**Burrus**
Your Majesty.
I bring news.

 
**Nero**
Oh, my Knight Burrus.
What's the matter?

 
**Burrus**
From the provinces ruled by the United Empire, we've received letters from the viceroys and director-generals who went missing.

 
**Burrus**
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'd appreciate it if you can read it.

 
**Nero**
Umu, Burrus.
What you just brought in is nothing less than good news!

 
**Nero**
Hand over their letter to me.
I've been concerned about them.

 
**Nero**
(If what Mash and others said was true, all the matters associated with the fake United Empire)

 
**Nero**
(will disappear without a trace at some point.
But, umu. For now I should just read the letters.)

 
**Nero**
(My dear vassals. How did they survive from the attack of the United Empire?)

 
**Nero**
(I should learn that.
I'm already someone who's killed her own mother&ndash;)

 
**Nero**
(All that's left is to continue to be the Emperor.
I believe my love will reach both my vassals and my people)

 
**Nero**
(...Isn't that right, O Romulus?)

 
**Burrus**
&ndash;Your Majesty?

 
**Nero**
Sorry, I think I got a little tired from singing.
But not to worry.

 
**Nero**
Give me the letters. I'll make sure to hear what the governors and others must say!

 
**Seneca**
...Your Imperial Majesty.
You seem to be pushing yourself too hard.

 
**Seneca**
It's already late at night.
You should rest soon.

 
**Nero**
Oh, Seneca.
Hehe, thank you for caring for me.

 
**Nero**
I got a stack of official work to deal with. I wish there were a few more of me so it wouldn't take this much time.

 
**Nero**
But that wouldn't work either.
For I am the one and only in Rome!

 
**Nero**
Hehe. It's okay.
I'm glad to hear you say that to me.

 
**Nero**
Once, when my mother was alive&ndash;

 
**Seneca**
Your Majesty.

 
**Nero**
Oh... Well, excuse me.
Never mind what I just said.

 
**Nero**
I've noticed my migraines are coming back.
Indeed this prevents me from finishing my work.

 
**Nero**
Certainly, I think I'm a little tired.
I'm going to bed now.

 
**Nero**
...Can I ask you to sleep by my side, private tutor?

 
**Seneca**
Please stop kidding.
But I'm glad you changed your mind.

 
**Seneca**
Please rest well.
You are our only Roman Emperor.

 
**Seneca**
You should never push yourself too hard.
Your recklessness will lead to Rome's recklessness.

 
**Nero**
Umu.
That makes sense&ndash;

 
**Mash**
...No one is here.
Nero appears to have gone to her bedroom.

 
**Fou**
Fou.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wow, Imperial Privilege EX is incredible!
It shut off your presence completely!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Besides, not only Romulus himself, but both Mash and Fujimaru as well.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I wonder which skill he used?
Um, is it possible to tell us&ndash;King Romulus?

 
**Romulus**
...

 
**Mash**
Romulus?

 
**Romulus**
...

 
**Mash**
Excuse me&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you worrying about Nero?
 
**Mash**
...Sure.
To Romulus, Nero is like a "descendant," I suppose.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rome?
 
**Mash**
Huh, Senpai?

 


---
 
**Romulus**
Every Roman is my child. Nero Claudius.
One of my beloved children.

 
**Romulus**
With such a tiny body, the fragile girl tries to support everything in the far-off land, Rome.

 
**Romulus**
I, Rome, witnessed love in her.
It's not gods' love, and yet not human's love, either.

 
**Romulus**
It is exactly... One of many forms of love a Roman emperor ought to possess.

 
**Romulus**
Even if that path heads to none other than the Underworld itself&ndash;

 
**Mash**
...Yes.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Right. In several years from now Emperor Nero's political power becomes weak, and she loses the support of everyone under her.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I cannot tell her the truth,
but sadly, it's just how the history is.

 
**Romulus**
Even if everyone rejects her, even if the gods reject her.

 
**Romulus**
I, Rome, shall never reject her.
Nero Claudius is great.

 
**Romulus**
She is&ndash;
truly a great "Roman emperor."

 
**Romulus**
Therefore, leave immediately. The "emperors" attracted,
gathered by my divine radiance.

 
**Mash**
What&ndash;

 
**Mash**
What did you just say?
We just came to check up on her, didn't we?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wait, I'm picking up something&ndash; It's a extremely powerful reaction, but different than a Servant!

 
**Dr. Roman**
A more vague existence. A ghost-type monster perhaps?
But this is too powerful for something naturally created.

 
**Romulus**
Augustus&ndash;!

 
**Romulus**
Tiberius, Claudius!
O, Trajanus! Hadroanus, Severus!

 
**Mash**
Names of the emperors of the ancient Roman Empire?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Ah, I got it!
Those ghosts are the "emperors" themselves!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Those "emperors" were chain-summoned by Romulus's existence, attracted by it.

 
**Fou**
Fooou!

 
**Mash**
I can sense hostility in their magical energy.
Senpai, this is going to be a battle!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's get ready for battle!
 
**Mash**
Yes, Master!
Your orders, please!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rome!
 
**Mash**
What!
S-Senpai?

 


---
 
**Romulus**
Emperors from the past!
Emperors from the future!

 
**Romulus**
You must all leave now! You certainly are Rome,
but now is the time of Nero!

 
**Romulus**
The short-lived United Empire is no more!
Hence, O, my children, gathering in the void!

 
**Romulus**
&ndash;Behold my spear!

 
**Romulus**
This spear I hold is Rome.
Hence, you shall&ndash;

 
**Romulus**
Return to Rome through my spear.
O, O, Magna Voluisse Magnum!

 
**Romulus**
&ndash;Rome!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
The battle is over.
All hostile targets were destroyed.

 
**Romulus**
...Rome will never collapse. Even if all the Roman emperors end up crawling on the ground.

 
**Romulus**
Rome will continue to shine in the past,
present, and future. I, Rome, can see that.

 
**Romulus**
Look, heavenly gods.
Behold my Rome, no&ndash;

 
**Romulus**
Behold Nero's Rome, one that lasted longer than mine.
Beautiful. This moment of beauty is infinite.

 
**Mash**
...Okay.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I think I can understand, or maybe not.
Hmm. What exactly is he saying?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Rome
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's Rome
 


---
 
**Mash**
...Oh, sure Senpai.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Huh?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wait a second. Mash, you just gave up on thinking, didn't you? And Fujimaru, you've been&ndash;

 
**Romulus**
Rome...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rome...
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes. Rome, it is.
Somehow&ndash;I started to understand it.

 
**Fou**
Fooou.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wait, wait, wait!
I still don't get it, what is it?

 
**Mash**
Doctor. No matter what history says,
at least Nero is shining at this time.

 
**Mash**
So, she's all right as she is.
I think he's saying...something like that.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, that is...
what it is?

 
**Romulus**
Rome...

 
**Fou**
Fooou...

 
**Roman Soldier**
It's right here, Lord Seneca! We've sensed an unusual presence from the Throne Room!

 
**Seneca**
Build up the defenses around Her Majesty's bedroom.
I need four soldiers to follow me to the Throne Room!

 
**Roman Soldier**
Yes sir!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Uh-oh, they'll find us!
Now, let's Rayshift out of here!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rome!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai!
Rome!

 
**Fou**
Fooou!

 
**Romulus**
&ndash;Rome forever!
