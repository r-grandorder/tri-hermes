# Cú Chulainn

<h2>The Taboo</h2>

**Mash:**
A demonic boar...in the forest?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, someone saw it in this forest lately, I hear.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
So you came to me?
I'm not a hunter.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Besides, there are others better suited than me.
Fionn's first spear, maybe. Know the guy?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I don't think he'd want to deal with a boar...
That's one of the biggest traumas in all his stories...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean Diarm&ndash;
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then maybe Ata
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Stop, Senpai.
Everyone has something they don't like.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Oh, fine... Sure.
Gáe Bolg was getting rusty anyway.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Oh, I see we're heading out now.
In a rush, huh?

 
**Mash:**
That's no boar, it's a stray homunculus.
Master, prepare for combat!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn:**
I guess that's it, then.
So, where's this boar?

 
**Mash:**
That's strange. They said it attacks as soon as you enter the forest, but instead...we saw a homunculus...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Oh, here we go.
Animal tracks. This one is big.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good work. I guess no monster is a match for the great hero of Celtic legend, huh?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Let's go, Master. Still...This is weird&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Oh...Senpai, let's go.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
&ndash;Wait. There it is.
This way.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh!?
I'm not picking up anything on my end...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
&ndash;Under those rocks.
Looks like we've got a problem on our hands.

 
**Mash:**
That's a big boar... But it's already dead.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's huge...
You can barely call it a boar now.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Really?
This is nothing, our boars had runes on their back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Celtic boars ate runes, huh?
That explains why some were tougher than dragons.

 
**Mash:**
But what could kill a boar that's this size?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
&ndash;We'll talk later missy.
Here it is...Our real prey!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What! A chimera?
Why is something like that here?

 
**Mash:**
Master, get back.
Let's do this!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Looks like an unskilled mage is just letting it roam free... Well, whatever.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I don't know where a chimera's heart is, but your luck ran out when you met me.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
It ain't a great heart, but it's worth aiming for.
All right, your heart is mine&mdash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn:**
I guess chimera's heart is just as fragile.
It was only playing dead, huh?

 
**Mash:**
No, it was a strong enough enemy...
Master, are you hurt anywhere?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, I'm fine.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By the way, what is that doing here?
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...I see, so that's what's going on.
Hey, step back a bit.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
&mdash;Should be around here.
There we go.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Could that be...rune spells?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, there's a cave beneath the rock!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
It was being concealed by spells.
This is an abandoned workshop.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Being third-rate doesn't mean it's okay to be sloppy, too.
If you're gonna leave, at least tidy up.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. Test objects were left roaming free when the workshop was abandoned...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This boar hunt may have taken an odd turn, but can we say it's been taken care of?

 
**Mash:**
What do we do with the remains of the chimera and the boar? We can't just leave them here...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Yeah, how about turning them into a stew?
The job's done, and I'm hungry!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Boar stew? Sounds great!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is Chimera stew even safe?
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Sure you can eat it. You can eat anything, as long as it's muscle. Just make sure it's cooked and you're set.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, if it's rotten and gives me the runs after it's sterilized, I'll deal with it then.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Right, tonight we dine in style! I'll get this cooked up and share it with you Chaldea guys!

 
**Fou:**
Foooooou!

 
**Mash:**
...Speaking of which, you sure know how to cook.
You're a Heroic Spirit of many talents, I guess.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I've been on my own a lot in my life.
Oh, the chimera tastes pretty good, huh?

 
**Fou:**
Fou! (Nom nom)

 
**Mash:**
You think it's good too, Fou?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know if you people are fearless or what...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Who knows what's in a chimera, but you're just gobbling it down.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's surprisingly good!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's fine like this.
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Hold it.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
If this is a chimera, did it use dogs as parts?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Who knows? A chimera is made by fusing all sorts of creatures together.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It could contain any number of them.
But, so what if it did?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You should have told me that first, you idiot!
I can't believe this! I'm leaving!

 
**Mash:**
Huh!?
You're done?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I don't want it! See you!
Dammit! I can't believe this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's with him?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, is it possible...
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, the Hound of Culann...
He swore he'd never eat a dog, didn't he?

 
**Mash:**
Didn't he consider himself a replacement... for the guard dog he killed? Ah, so that's why...(Nom nom)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It tastes good, though...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We messed up.
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
