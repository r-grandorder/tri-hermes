# Arjuna

<h2>True Value of the Divine Bow</h2>

**Mash:**
Wow...

 
**Arjuna:**
...Well. This is about 10% of its original power.

 
**Mash:**
T-Ten percent?

 
**Arjuna:**
I accept you as my Master, Fujimaru. But that doesn't mean I pledge my loyalty to you.

 
**Arjuna:**
The most important thing in this world is trust. By fighting together, I was able to know you better.

 
**Arjuna:**
But, that is not enough. Therefore, I would like to test you, Master.

 
**Arjuna:**
It's simple. Just join me for three fights. During those fights, I will obey your every order.

 
**Arjuna:**
On the other hand, I won't do anything aside from obeying your orders. How well you utilize me as a weapon...

 
**Arjuna:**
That's what I want to see. Is that all right?

 
**Arjuna:**
...Oh, there's no problem if you want the other Servants to help as well.

 
**Arjuna:**
I'm looking forward to it.

 
**Arjuna:**
I know this is sudden, but enemies are approaching. As always, enemies this level are easy prey for us.

 
**Arjuna:**
I seek a graceful, quick delivery of instructions from you, Master. That is all.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Arjuna:**
Hmm, well done. Cutting off all thought and letting myself be controlled is not a bad feeling.

 
**Arjuna:**
However, don't get overconfident about beating those weaklings. The next enemies will be somewhat formidable.

 
**Arjuna:**
You must be able to defeat formidable opponents with ease. Otherwise, you're unfit to be a commander.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Don't worry. At least there's no fear of getting killed.

 
**Arjuna:**
I, Arjuna, guarantee it.
Well, let the fight begin.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew...

 
**Arjuna:**
Splendid! I acknowledge that there is no problem with Master's ability to command.

 
**Arjuna:**
Now, this is the last test. Considering the type of enemies we may face in the future...

 
**Arjuna:**
I had a Servant prepared for this. No longer will you be fighting a mindless beast, but rather a true Hero recognized by the World itself.

 
**Arjuna:**
We must win. No matter how strong the enemy is, I must obtain a glorious victory.

 
**Arjuna:**
...No, I guess WE must obtain a glorious victory. Come, let's fight.

 
**Arjuna:**
I shall be a silent arrow! You just need to fire me toward the ones you recognize as your enemy.

 
**Arjuna:**
That's the ideal relationship of a Servant and a Master. Now, let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Arjuna:**
&ndash;Good. As expected, your talents as a Master are genuine. I trust you fully, and therefore pledge my allegiance to you.

 
**Arjuna:**
The name of my bow is Agni Gandiva. This divine bow granted by the God of Flame can shoot down anything.

 
**Arjuna:**
I will show you its true strength in our upcoming battles.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Oh?

 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;Heh heh, this bow is ideal for you. Why don't I show you the true brilliance of its flame now!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Arjuna:**
By the hellfire of Agni, God of Flame, be incinerated to ashes! ...No, this is not enough.

 
**Arjuna:**
O Shiva, God of Destruction... Rain down divine punishment upon my foes!

 
**Arjuna:**
...How was that, Master?
No, you don't have to say anything.

 
**Arjuna:**
With this, my power has been proven. My weapon and Noble Phantasm are the most powerful of their kind.

 
**Arjuna:**
You can proudly declare that I'm the best Servant.

 
**Mash:**
U-Um...

 
**Arjuna:**
Yes?

 
**Mash:**
The forest has been leveled.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Uh...uh...

 
**Arjuna:**
I think I was a little too enthusiastic...
I am sorry.


<h2>By Continuing to Question</h2>

**Arjuna:**
...There you are, Karna.

 
**Karna:**
Arjuna.

 
**Arjuna:**
No obstacles remain for me.
Even if they did, I would destroy them all.

 
**Arjuna:**
This will be the end.
I may be called a coward, but I will kill you.

 
**Arjuna:**
I need to kill you!
You know me, after all!

 
**Karna:**
...So this is karma. There is not room enough in the world for two supreme marksmen.

 
**Karna:**
My lance should be alone in its ability to scorch the land.

 
**Karna:**
There's no question of who dies here.
The loser will become unnecessary.

 
**Karna:**
Come at me, Arjuna. Lay it all on the line.
Give it everything you have!

 
**Arjuna:**
Don't speak down to me!
You asked for it!

 
**Karna:**
...Brilliant.

 
**Arjuna:**
Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha!
I win! My...my...my...!

 
**Arjuna:**
...

 
**Narration:**
Is this truly victory?
Or is this actually defeat?

 
**Narration:**
I have no sense of satisfaction,
no joy from this victory...

 
**Narration:**
I don't even feel a sense of relief that the battle is over. The only thing that I have is this ceaseless feeling of emptiness.

 
**Narration:**
I just killed the man who knew me best.

 
**Narration:**
I have no regrets. My original sworn enemy...my oldest enemy. We were destined to fight each other. And yet...

 
**Narration:**
That man, who waded through battle after battle in blinding, golden armor...

 
**Narration:**
...was the one and only hero who knew the ugly side of me.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Why, Karna?

 
**Arjuna:**
Why...why did you smile?

 
**Narration:**
And then my life came to an end while I yet pondered that mystery.

 
**Narration:**
As Arjuna, the Hero of the Endowed...I existed to protect the future.

 
**Arjuna:**
And then I was summoned as a Servant, and participated in many battles. I trust Master wholeheartedly.

 
**Arjuna:**
[♂ He /♀️ She} may be ordinary, and there are times when [♂ he /♀️ she} is too optimistic...yet still, [♂ he's /♀️ she's} a good Master.

 
**Arjuna:**
Faithful. Accurate decision-making skills. And [♂ he /♀️ she} does not treat us Servants as mere familiars. [♂ He /♀️ She} treats us with respect, but is not distant.

 
**Arjuna:**
Many Servants would consider [♂ him /♀️ her} the ideal Master.
I number myself among them.

 
**Arjuna:**
That is why I unleashed the absolute limit of my Noble Phantasm's power. And yet...

 
**Arjuna:**
I have yet to show my true face to Master.
No, I mustn't show it...

 
**Arjuna:**
My blunt ugliness out in the open...!

 
**Mash:**
Master. I have detected numerous enemies.
It seems like a surprise attack.

 
**Arjuna:**
Comfortable battles. A sense of fulfillment I feel knowing that I am fighting in the cause of absolute justice.

 
**Arjuna:**
The most wonderful cause of saving the world.
Ah...I cannot stop laughing.

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Arjuna?


---
 
**Arjuna:**
...No, it's nothing.
Now, let's go annihilate the enemy.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemy response, zero.
No problems on our end. I recommend returning.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master. Good work to you as well.
I will have sesame buns ready for you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's get back, Arjuna.
 
**Arjuna:**
Yes, understood.

 


---
 
**Arjuna:**
By the way, Master, was there something on my face a few minutes ago?

 
**Arjuna:**
Nothing?
I didn't look myself?

 
**Mash:**
At least on my end, I did not see any fluctuations in his Spirit Origin value. Perhaps it's fatigue?

 
**Mash:**
Arjuna, you've been volunteering for battle rather frequently recently.

 
**Mash:**
And the other Servants, especially the battle-hungry ones, have been complaining that it's not fair.

 
**Arjuna:**
...I may have overexerted myself.

 
**Arjuna:**
Understood. I will be sure to leave the battles to the other Servants for a while.

 
**Mash:**
Okay. Good work again!

 
**Mash:**
Ah-ha, Senpai. I win in this round of cards.
I will be taking this sesame bun as my prize.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But if you eat right before bed...
 
**Mash:**
...S-Servants don't gain weight.
That applies to Demi-Servants, too!

 
**Mash:**
...Probably.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's all yours.
 
**Mash:**
Hehe. Don't sulk, Senpai.
I have one for you, too.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Sweet dreams, Senpai...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Night!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, good night.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good night to you too, Fou.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...?


---
 
**Arjuna:**
...I defeated him.
He's defeated.

 
**Arjuna:**
Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha!
I win! My...my...my...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Arjuna...?


---
 
**Arjuna:**
Master!?
You...

 
**Arjuna:**
...saw my face, didn't you.

 
**Arjuna:**
You're finally awake, Master.

 
**Arjuna:**
...I am surprised.

 
**Arjuna:**
You do not seem at all bewildered by the unexpected scene you just witnessed.

 
**Arjuna:**
It seems that we have fallen into a Servant's dream. It's likely that it's my dream, or that of someone who has some connection with me.

 
**Arjuna:**
If it's mine...then I apologize in advance.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm used to it. This happens a lot.
 
**Arjuna:**
Spoken like a true Master.
But getting too used to this is hardly a good thing.

 
**Arjuna:**
You may one day be a prisoner of a different type of nightmare... Should you die inside a dream, your spirit will perish.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm in a dream again, aren't I?
 
**Arjuna:**
When you say “again,” do you mean you fall into the dreams of others often?

 
**Arjuna:**
This is neither a Rayshift nor a case of teleportation.

 
**Arjuna:**
It's truly a curious phenomenon...
But this is a first for me.

 


---
 
**Arjuna:**
Anyway, we can do little if we remain in this darkness. We must analyze our surroundings.

 
**Arjuna:**
Master, do not move. If we lose sight of each other, it will be difficult for us to find one another again.

 
**Arjuna:**
...It's subtle, but I sense a breeze.
Let's head in that direction.

 
**Arjuna:**
This place is like a labyrinth...and it's quite elaborate.

 
**Arjuna:**
Not only that... No...one moment.

 
**Arjuna:**
This is not right.
I do not understand.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?


---
 
**Arjuna:**
My only sense of this is, I admit, intuitive, but this labyrinth does not lead any higher than we are now.

 
**Arjuna:**
The only path leads lower...to the bottom.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So there's no exit?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Seems about right for a dungeon in a nightmare...
 


---
 
**Arjuna:**
Yes, exactly. It's nonsensically structured, as only dreams can be.

 
**Arjuna:**
Honestly.
My apologies. This is most likely my own nightmare.

 
**Arjuna:**
Were this your nightmare,
it wouldn't have been as malicious as it is now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
My nightmare... Eli's last supper. With live music.
 
**Arjuna:**
Is this Eli the mixed dragon Servant? Hahaha. A concert festival certainly sounds interesting.

 
**Arjuna:**
Eh? A nightmare? Isn't it just music?
What? I don't get the underlying issue?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My nightmare would be Nightingale disinfecting me.
 
**Arjuna:**
That...is terrifying.

 
**Arjuna:**
My own mother, perhaps reflective of the times, spoiled me. Yet I still feel maternal love from Nightingale's fierceness.

 
**Arjuna:**
Either way, isn't it nice to know the Servant is genuinely concerned for you?

 
**Arjuna:**
A dream where she chases after you with a tank of disinfectant on her back? ...I see, that IS a nightmare...

 


---
 
**Arjuna:**
Anyway, let's begin our descent.
I have a feeling that that is our best option.

 
**Arjuna:**
It is annoying, though, to have so many creatures scuttling about... No, it shouldn't be an issue.

 
**Arjuna:**
We should have no trouble breaking through.
Now then, let us cut them down.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemy response, zero.
No problems on our end. I recommend returning.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master. Good work to you as well.
I will have sesame buns ready for you.

 

---

Yes, good night.

Good night to you too, Fou.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Arjuna:**

**Arjuna:**
We should have no trouble breaking through.
Now then, let us cut them down.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Arjuna:**
This is my answer: I am a Kshatriya,
but I am a Servant&ndash;a familiar&ndash;at the same time.

 
**Arjuna:**
I have a warrior's pride.
I fulfill my duties as a familiar.

 
**Arjuna:**
I can be both. I will not forsake my pride as a warrior, even as I swear my loyalty as a familiar.

 
**Rama:**
So you understand the theory. A sensible answer,
as I would expect from the great Arjuna.

 
**Rama:**
But your response is acceptable only because this is a peaceful moment. I wonder whether you can give the same answer in a time of crisis.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Are you mocking me?

 
**Rama:**
Move on to your next trial, hero.
Your destined enemy awaits!

 
**Arjuna:**
...I know. There's only one warrior in this world who radiates such fighting spirit.

 
**Karna:**
You've come, Arjuna.

 
**Arjuna:**
Karna... Why are you here!?
You shouldn't be in a place like this!

 
**Karna:**
My presence here suggests that you believe otherwise.

 
**Karna:**
An enemy who puts a question to Arjuna...
That is my role here.

 
**Karna:**
I ask of you, my sworn enemy:
Who are you?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Krishna:**
Ungh! Not yet!
Give me your hand, Arjuna!

 
**Krishna:**
We must stand up together to fight against evil!

 
**Arjuna:**
...

 
**Arjuna:**
...No. That's wrong.
You're wrong, Krishna.

 
**Arjuna:**
I know it's wrong.

 
**Krishna:**
Wh-what?

 
**Arjuna:**
I've been thinking about this the whole time.
It's because of you that I was able to fire that arrow.

 
**Arjuna:**
I blamed all my cowardice, everything I did that was unbecoming of a true warrior...on you.

 
**Arjuna:**
...At that time, I just wanted relief.
I thought the battle with Karna was going to last forever.

 
**Arjuna:**
The person I had been was being swallowed, and I despaired, knowing I was moving away from the path of a warrior.

 
**Arjuna:**
But I must accept it. No matter how much I wish to resist, the one who fired that arrow was...

 
**Krishna:**
Don't say it, Arjuna! If you say it,
you will be cursed for thousands of years!

 
**Karna:**
You must say it, Arjuna.

 
**Karna:**
There is no correct answer. The only thing you can do is hold on to your conviction until the very end.

 
**Karna:**
There will be times when you will feel lost.
That is why we must walk the path with Master.

 
**Karna:**
A Servant needs to live their second life carrying their doubts with them.

 
**Karna:**
After all, you have never before reached this place where you now stand, not even in life.

 
**Arjuna:**
...I was the one who fired the arrow.

 
**Arjuna:**
I held that arrow, I fit the arrow to the bow,
and let it loose. It was me, Arjuna.

 
**Arjuna:**
I'm sorry.

 
**Arjuna:**
Krishna. At that decisive moment,
you were not on the chariot with me.

 
**Karna:**
That's right.

 
**Karna:**
Krishna was fighting elsewhere. But after he learned of how much humiliation you suffered, he kept quiet.

 
**Krishna:**
...You are going to be admitting your own evil. Whether you be alive, dead, or even a Heroic Spirit, you cannot ever take that back.

 
**Krishna:**
You will bear this regret for eternity.

 
**Arjuna:**
That may be true.
But I have decided I will no longer fear regret.

 
**Krishna:**
...

 
**Krishna:**
I see...Then I shall hold on to that regret of yours.

 
**Arjuna:**
Krishna?

 
**Krishna:**
Maybe...just maybe...my existence is the leak in the dam.

 
**Arjuna:**
I don't understand what you're getting at.

 
**Krishna:**
Nothing. I'm just talking to myself. Don't worry about it. It's time to wake up, Fujimaru.

 
**Krishna:**
It's unlikely I will make another appearance anytime soon. You should forget about this whole dream.

 
**Karna:**
I will not be appearing here again.
Farewell Arjuna. Farewell Master.

 
**Arjuna:**
I will fade away too.

 
**Arjuna:**
But I must apologize, Master. The numerous times you were put in danger...all of it was because of me.

 
**Arjuna:**
It is probably because the bond between you and I has grown stronger.

 
**Arjuna:**
The deeper the bond I form with someone, the more fearful I become of them learning of the existence of my Krishna.

 
**Arjuna:**
That's why I called you to my dream,
and tried to kill you.

 
**Arjuna:**
I'm such a fool... A vile, detestable betrayer.
I would not protest should I be put to death.

 
**Arjuna:**
...Master.
Now you know all of who...of what I am.

 
**Arjuna:**
And yet, you still embrace my everything...my light, my darkness, and my evil.

 
**Arjuna:**
I see... Then I will never again fear that smile of yours, nor this darkness. Never again...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This...isn't a dream, is it?


---
 
**Arjuna:**
You have awoken, Master.
I thank you for showing me such a wonderful dream.

 
**Arjuna:**
And I would also like to apologize for putting your life in danger.

 
**Arjuna:**
But I am in something of a bind. The crime that I committed should cost me my life, but if I do offer up my life, I would not be able to fight for you anymore.

 
**Arjuna:**
Whatever should I do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Morning, Arjuna.


---
 
**Arjuna:**
...Good morning.

 
**Arjuna:**
I will waver no more.
I will dedicate all that I have to serving you.

 
**Arjuna:**
But now that I think about it...

 
**Arjuna:**
I felt like I was on a long, long journey...
Yet it seemed a short thing at the same time.

 
**Arjuna:**
There is nothing absolute in this world.
Various substances prowl, wander, and are transient.

 
**Arjuna:**
Emotions are no exception.
Even love can one day change to hate and sadness.

 
**Arjuna:**
Or the opposite might happen.

 
**Arjuna:**
But there is just one thing that I can say with confidence.

 
**Arjuna:**
...I feel fortunate to have met you.

 
**Narration:**
I am an Archer. My True Name is Arjuna.
I am a Kshatriya warrior and a Servant...

 
**Narration:**
I lend my strength to a Master in order to win back the future. I am just an average Heroic Spirit.

 
**Narration:**
I am a descendant of a god, but not a god myself. I may have incredible power that ordinary humans lack, but I am still human.

 
**Narration:**
I simply fight. I fight for my Master.
My reason for fighting is my belief in my Master.

 
**Narration:**
That is all I require to see myself as a hero. For that purpose, I can embrace the darkness within me and not be abashed by it.

 
**Narration:**
I am an Archer.
I am Arjuna.

 
**Narration:**
I am Fujimaru's Servant.
