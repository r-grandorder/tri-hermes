# Cleopatra

<h2>Where Beauty Lies</h2>

**Cleopatra**
Hello! As ever, you have that sad puppy look on your face, Master!

 
**Cleopatra**
But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all. Everything is!

 
**Cleopatra**
Besides, it's the common crossbreed pups with that doe-eyed sad look who stop passersby at the pet shop windows.

 
**Cleopatra**
Too many expensive breeds with bright eyes and shining coats could intimidate people passing by!

 
**Cleopatra**
That's why you shouldn't feel ashamed and actually be proud of being a hot ticket item.

 
**Cleopatra**
After all, no matter how much you flail about,
you can never change the essence of who you are.

 
**Mash**
O-okay... To be honest, I do not really understand what you're saying.

 
**Mash**
But anyway... Welcome, Cleopatra.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You are quite the beauty today, as usual.
 
**Cleopatra**
Tee hee. I tire of such praise.
You're only stating the obvious, you know.

 
**Cleopatra**
But at least you never fail to acknowledge those around you. Let's go eat some fruit together later.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hello.
 
**Cleopatra**
You have the gall to address me like a mere friend!? I should be adored like the queen that I am! This is a disgrace that I, Cleopatra VII, have never experienced!

 
**Cleopatra**
Such disrespect! And yet how refreshing! Whatever should I do!? What kind of reward would you like, for offering such new experience to me!?

 


---
 
**Mash**
So, Cleopatra, we seldom see you around here.

 
**Mash**
What brings you here today?

 
**Cleopatra**
...?
But you just mentioned my reason for being here.

 
**Mash**
Wha...?

 
**Cleopatra**
...(Sigh) I suppose I'll have to spell it out for you, won't I?

 
**Cleopatra**
As a special favor to you, I'll explain everything.
Clear as day.

 
**Cleopatra**
Listen. It's been quite a while since I was summoned here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I use your fighting technique all the time.


---
 
**Cleopatra**
But I realized that I had forgotten something crucial.

 
**Cleopatra**
It's something that should have been done much earlier, and I feel that failing to do so has caused certain complications to arise.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...What is it?


---
 
**Cleopatra**
... You do realize that you summoned me, the ultimate beauty of the world, Cleopatra VII Philopator, right?

 
**Cleopatra**
And thus, I am able to make time, without any warning, and without opening up anyone's schedule and do this...

 
**Cleopatra**
Which means, there's only one thing to do...

 
**Cleopatra**
We must have a photo shoot!

 
**Mash**
!?

 
**Mash**
I-I'm sorry, Cleopatra.
I don't quite follow...

 
**Cleopatra**
What was unclear in what I said?

 
**Cleopatra**
I can't imagine I need to explain what a photo shoot is, do I?

 
**Cleopatra**
I do not visit Master's room that often...so I wish to immortalize this moment with a photo shoot!

 
**Cleopatra**
If you still don't understand now, then you will just have to come and see for yourself.

 
**Cleopatra**
Now come, Master.
It's time to head out!

 
**Cleopatra**
A professional photo shoot obviously requires a talented photographer. We must first recruit a cameraman!

 
**Mash**
Oh, wait, Cleopatra!
Cleopatra!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's no use arguing. Let's go.
 
**Mash**
...I suppose we can't just leave her alone like this.
Who knows what she has in mind, though...

 
**Mash**
All right, Senpai. After you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's play along. Sounds like fun.
 
**Mash**
Fun...? Do you think so...?

 
**Mash**
Either way, we can't just leave Cleopatra to her devices. All right, Senpai. After you.

 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
You should be honored. You have been selected as the gifted artisan who will immortalize my beauty!

 
**Georgios**
...?

 
**Mash**
I-I'm terribly sorry, Georgios.

 
**Mash**
I'm sure Cleopatra's beautiful, wonderful greeting has you so dumbfounded that you've just stopped in your tracks, and can think of nothing to say.

 
**Mash**
Allow me to explain what she was talking about.

 
**Mash**
She is asking you to be her photographer, Georgios.

 
**Georgios**
Well, if it isn't Master and Mash.

 
**Georgios**
I see...so you seek my talent.

 
**Georgios**
If that is what you require, I'd be happy to accept...
But I was actually on my way to the Saints' Club...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Saints' Club?


---
 
**Georgios**
As the name entails,
it is a meeting of the saints here in Chaldea.

 
**Georgios**
There's no official agenda, but I believe there is a purpose for me in joining such a club.

 
**Georgios**
Yes... For example, should a saintly woman with excessive strength start shadow boxing all of a sudden...

 
**Georgios**
Or should a mysterious, saint-like individual from the Far East chuckle menacingly...

 
**Georgios**
Or if a precocious young saint asks where babies come from...

 
**Georgios**
Or if a dark saintly woman who shows contempt for sainthood mistakenly gets captured on film...

 
**Georgios**
When such a time comes, I will need to be present.
Oh, my Lord...

 
**Mash**
Y-you seem to have it tough...

 
**Cleopatra**
Then this is exactly the time you're waiting for!

 
**Cleopatra**
Unlike that obscure and unfulfilling labor that you mentioned, the job that I am requesting you to do is quite simple. Rewarding. Coveted, in fact.

 
**Cleopatra**
In better times, my worshippers (read: fans) would have desired even the tiniest reminder of my beauty to keep and gaze upon lovingly in their homes...

 
**Cleopatra**
And they would have gladly waited in long lines carrying their expensive memory-preserving machines that were purchased with their life savings!

 
**Cleopatra**
As I said, you are being freely offered this great honor. You have no cause to hesitate!

 
**Georgios**
Yes, but I am not hesitating.

 
**Georgios**
I have prior commitments, and who knows what kind of hellish scene the Saints' Club may be without me there.

 
**Cleopatra**
Ungh... He cannot seem to grasp my simple logic. Even a child would have understood. He really must not know a thing about beauty.

 
**Cleopatra**
He must have lived an abstentious life, which led to him forgetting what it even means to love beauty.

 
**Cleopatra**
So obsessed with sainthood.
How sad...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, he IS a saint...


---
 
**Cleopatra**
It's fine.
I have found our directive.

 
**Cleopatra**
The reason why this man is not accepting the honor of being my photographer is because he is a sad, sad man who does not appreciate beauty.

 
**Cleopatra**
In order to regain such appreciation, words will not suffice. Rather, he needs a shock to his system to free him of his silly notions.

 
**Cleopatra**
Yes...yes. If that is what is needed,
then we have no choice.

 
**Cleopatra**
I shall personally beat an appreciation of beauty into this man! My own beauty knows no parallel, after all!

 
**Georgios**
...Mm, what do you mean by “personally”?

 
**Mash**
Georgios!
What is that expression on your face!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It looks like he's imagining something unsaintly!


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Hm? What do you mean, “unsaintly”? I was just going to show that nincompoop what beauty is with my body...

 
**Cleopatra**
...!

 
**Cleopatra**
There...there is absolutely no way I would have shown my skin to a man I do not love!!!

 
**Cleopatra**
People may have called me a seductress who manipulated men to further her country's interests...

 
**Cleopatra**
But I did what I did because I fell in love with all those handsome men!

 
**Cleopatra**
...Ahem. I digress.
It's hard to convey your true feelings to others...

 
**Cleopatra**
Let's try this again, without any misunderstandings.
Let's demonstrate with actions, not with words.

 
**Cleopatra**
Basically, I'm going to beat a sense of beauty back into you myself!

 
**Cleopatra**
Brace yourself, saintly photographer!


**--BATTLE--**

**Cleopatra**
You'll take the job? You said you'll take the job, right? Ohoho, you should have said so from the get-go!

 
**Mash**
...Are you sure about this?

 
**Georgios**
Yes. If she needs me that much, I cannot refuse.

 
**Georgios**
To be honest, her dazzling form was quite blinding.
In fact, I was nearly blinded several times.

 
**Mash**
Georgios...does that mean...are you actually blind now...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What about the Saints' Club?


---
 
**Georgios**
I've arranged it so that King David will be there as a special guest.

 
**Georgios**
He has many moving stories to tell. He has the power to make his listeners go into a trance. So he should be able to carry the meeting for now.

 
**Mash**
How the other saints will listen and react to King David's story is intriguing in itself...

 
**Mash**
But everything has been arranged.
Now let us head to this photography session...

 
**Cleopatra**
(Gasp!)
No, I forgot one other crucial detail!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now what!?
 
**Cleopatra**
The background! There is absolutely no way we are doing a shoot in this dingy cave!

 
**Cleopatra**
...Actually, I wonder why the Saints' Club meets in a place like this. But let's leave that aside for now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's about the shooting site, isn't it?
 
**Cleopatra**
Exactly. Of course my Master could figure that out.
I want a photo shoot to match a Hollywood star!

 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
If my beauty is to be preserved in a photo,
there must also be a suitable background!

 
**Cleopatra**
So there you have it. Let's continue our Rayshifting in search of the perfect background for the shoot!

 
**Cleopatra**
Mash, go ahead with the preparations!
If you're shorthanded, use all of Chaldea's staff!

 
**Cleopatra**
There's no need to pay them extra for this!
The privilege of looking upon me is reward enough!

 
**Cleopatra**
Oh, but my bright and dazzling form will cause some of the staff to go blind. I guess I would have to offer them extra pay to compensate them.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Why can't she just agree to pay them part-time wages?)


---
 
**Mash**
Well, basically everything she's doing just shouts “Cleopatra”...

 
**Mash**
Anyway, it appears that I need to make some preparations.

 
**Mash**
I'm going to grin and bear it and help out in Cleopatra's photo shoot!


**--ARROW--**

**Georgios**
Hm. Now that I've connected the instant photo processing device specially made by Da Vinci...

 
**Georgios**
Okay. Not bad. Here's how it turned out...
What do you think?

 
**Cleopatra**
Hmmm. Not...terrible... Maybe it's that I'm alone...maybe it'll be different when we do the shoot for real...

 
**Mash**
She seems to be muttering about something. I think she's being particular at something, but I can only imagine how high her standards must be.

 
**Cleopatra**
Master?
Come over here. Next to me.

 
**Cleopatra**
Yes. Direct your face over there...just like that. Got it? Now don't move. Come on, photographer, take it now!

 
**Georgios**
Moving on to taking the two of you? Understood.
Three, two, one... Say “cheese.”

 
**Georgios**
What do you think?

 
**Cleopatra**
...

 
**Cleopatra**
Honestly, it's bad.
One subject totally outshines the other.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I'm sorry...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This is what happens when an ordinary Masterpairs up with the world's greatest beauty...)


---
 
**Mash**
N-no, I don't think that's true!
I like this photo...

 
**Mash**
So there's no need to be so disappointed...!

 
**Georgios**
If the client is not satisfied, I fail as a photographer.
I can retake as many as needed.

 
**Cleopatra**
We obviously need a reshoot.
Maybe the background just isn't working.

 
**Cleopatra**
If the photo's not turning out right even after so many takes, maybe we're just in the wrong place. Let's head to a different location!

 
**Cleopatra**
Unacceptable! You say there's something lacking, but I say EVERYTHING'S lacking!

 
**Georgios**
Ugh...!

 
**Georgios**
I may be able to retaliate should the comment just be an emotional outburst, but this is coming from a pharaoh who left her mark on history.

 
**Georgios**
Even I know that this photograph does not accentuate the subject matter to its true potential.

 
**Georgios**
I cannot call myself a photographer and say this is my best work!

 
**Mash**
Those two are very serious.
It's like a heated battle of some sort.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's fine, but why do I need to be in the photos?


---
 
**Mash**
(The question is whether Master's psyche can withstand every photo that gets criticized.)

 
**Georgios**
Now, I would like to do another shoot,
but we're starting to lose the light.

 
**Cleopatra**
Isn't there anything you can do?

 
**Georgios**
I never imagined that this photo session would take so long...and go to so many different places...

 
**Georgios**
This problem would be solved if we just had a reflector, but I didn't bring one this time.

 
**Georgios**
This oversight is absolutely my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Reflexer?


---
 
**Mash**
No, Master. He means a reflector,
a device that redirects light...

 
**Mash**
During a photo shoot, it can adjust the intensity and direction of the subject's lighting.

 
**Mash**
I hear that photographers have many uses for them.

 
**Georgios**
It's exactly as Mash explained.
What I need right now is a white reflector.

 
**Georgios**
Hm. Maybe I should go back and retrieve it...
Well, some white cloth might get the job done, but...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A white cloth... Is there one around here?


---
 
**Mash**
I'm sorry, I don't have one, either.

 
**Mash**
There couldn't be one just conveniently lying around...

 
**Cleopatra**
!?

 
**Mash**
Y-you're...!?

 
**D：???**
...A-ahem.

 
**D：???**
I am...a mysterious...Medjed-looking...being.
You...two. Come...here...

 
**Cleopatra**
A-am I dreaming!?
Is a life-sized Medjed talking to me!?

 
**Cleopatra**
...And where are you taking Master and Mash!?

 
**Cleopatra**
Are you going to give just the two of them some kind of special protection or something!? I'm almost jealous!

 
**Mash**
Ummm, what are you doing here, Nito&ndash;

 
**D：???**
Shhhh!

 
**D：???**
...(Whisper, whisper)...

 
**Mash**
O-okay. You're saying that even though you prepared a swimsuit, you couldn't go swimming much in it...

 
**Mash**
And so you came here to this beach to try to make use of that swimsuit...?

 
**Mash**
But that's not a very regal thing to do, so you don't want us to let Cleopatra know you're here.

 
**D：???**
And so...right now...I am not...this Nito-something. Under...stand?

 
**Mash**
Y-yes...so you just want us to keep this a secret. Understood.

 
**Mash**
Now that I think back,
Cleopatra wasn't around during the summer races...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wasn't she on her honeymoon?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wasn't she stalking Caesar?


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Hey, over there!
How long are you going to be chatting behind my back?

 
**Cleopatra**
It would be nice if you would introduce me to this person with the exceptionally godly aura!

 
**D：???**
I...am. Just a...god...who's passing...by.
Nice to...meet you...Cleopatra...

 
**Cleopatra**
My...what wonderful manners!
And it is quite knowledgeable.

 
**Cleopatra**
But then, it is the great Medjed!
I knew you would know my name...!

 
**Cleopatra**
Oh...this is the first time I've spoken with the great Medjed, so I'm a bit nervous!

 
**Cleopatra**
My heart is racing like the first time I met Caesar... Could this be...love...?

 
**D：???**
...

 
**Cleopatra**
Ugh...but the great Medjed possesses beauty that could even stand alongside my own unabashed!

 
**Cleopatra**
I mustn't take a photograph now...not with such greatness present. I know better than to show disrespect before a god.

 
**D：???**
By...the way. What...were you...doing?
Photo...graph...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You see...


---
 
**Georgios**
...That's what happened.
These are the photos we have taken so far.

 
**Georgios**
Unfortunately, none of these have met with my client's satisfaction.

 
**D：???**
Hm...I...see...

 
**D：???**
...

 
**D：???**
I see...what her...intent...her purpose...is.
Then...I shall...assist...

 
**D：???**
If you need...something white...I can...be...of help...

 
**Cleopatra**
The great Medjed is going to act as a reflector!?
We are not worthy!

 
**Cleopatra**
But this may be what is necessary to make my special photo shoot worthy! Ah, what a conundrum!

 
**D：???**
How...ever...
It comes...with a...price.

 
**D：???**
Show me...your beauty...
Do so...and I will...help.

 
**Georgios**
I'm thrilled that you will help us out, but...whatever do you mean?

 
**Mash**
That is a fair question.
Let me ask. U-um...

 
**Mash**
“Look at me. If I helped freely, appreciation of the great Medjed would diminish.”

 
**Mash**
...That was Medjed's response.

 
**Cleopatra**
I see. I understand.

 
**Cleopatra**
This is a trial. I am being given a divine revelation saying I am to receive the blessings of Medjed, and that I shouldn't be satisfied with my current state, and that I must continue pursuing beauty further!

 
**Cleopatra**
...Then I shall happily undertake this trial!


**--BATTLE--**

**Georgios**
If you would, please move a bit more to the right.
Yes, right there. The lighting is just perfect.

 
**Georgios**
Now here we go. Say “cheese.”

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait, how come I'm in this picture, too?


---
 
**Georgios**
Hm, what do you think?
I believe this is one of our best yet.

 
**Cleopatra**
Yes. There's nothing wrong with the photo.
But...

 
**Georgios**
You're still not satisfied?

 
**Cleopatra**
No... You know what, we should try thinking about this differently.

 
**Cleopatra**
If we're not getting the result we want even after all these attempts, it means we're not lacking something... But maybe there's something...conflicting...

 
**Cleopatra**
The issue is...pinpointing what exactly it is.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe it's because I'm in it...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe it's better if it's just Cleopatra...


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Nonsense. If that were true, there would be no point in this endeavor in the first place.

 
**Mash**
...?

 
**D：???**
The key...is...the point...of this...endeavor...

 
**Cleopatra**
...!?

 
**Cleopatra**
Yes. You're right.
Great Medjed, you read me like a book.

 
**Cleopatra**
We should have never tried to match the background to me.

 
**Cleopatra**
The most beautiful subject in this photo is undoubtedly me, but I should not be the photo's focus.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Huh?


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Then I will focus on matching the background with the main subject. Let me ask you, Master.

 
**Cleopatra**
What backdrop do you think would be the most fitting for you?

 
**Mash**
Well, I didn't think it was going quite this way...

 
**Mash**
But I believe you just have to think of the most fitting place for a photo shoot, Senpai.

 
**Mash**
Where would that be?
I will go wherever you like.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hmmmm, let's see...
 


---
 
**Mash**
Eh? This is Chaldea's Command Room...
Here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. Let's take it with everyone else too.
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
If you insist, then I don't mind letting the other staff members join in. But why here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm here thanks to everyone's efforts.


---
 
**Cleopatra**
So that's why you think this is the most fitting backdrop for you. ...Well, that's fine.

 
**Georgios**
Then let's see how this one goes. I want everyone to get closer to the middle, closer to Master.

 
**Georgios**
Yes. That's it. Here we go...

 
**Cleopatra**
Let me see how it turned out.

 
**Cleopatra**
...I see.
So this is how it was supposed to be.

 
**Cleopatra**
This is fine.
I believe it turned out splendidly.

 
**Mash**
I inadvertently got into the picture next to Senpai, too...

 
**Mash**
But it looks like this photograph has finally satisfied Cleopatra.

 
**Cleopatra**
Yes. I'm satisfied. Now take a look at this picture,
Master. Now do you understand?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
About, what?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm sorry I still don't understand...


---
 
**Cleopatra**
...Do I have to spell everything out for you?
Don't you get it?

 
**Cleopatra**
This is a picture that encapsulates my eternal beauty, alongside you...who are also beautiful.

 
**Georgios**
Weren't you always saying that it was ill-matched the whole time?

 
**Cleopatra**
I was never talking about the matchup between Master and me.

 
**Cleopatra**
My captivating beauty, and while [♂ his /♀️ hers} could never be a match for mine, my beautiful Master...and a background that embraces the two subjects.

 
**Cleopatra**
That was what was badly matched.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh? But I don't think I'm beautiful...


---
 
**Mash**
...No, Senpai. If you look at that photograph, Cleopatra and I are both in agreement.

 
**Mash**
This photograph taken in the Command Room with you, Cleopatra, and all the staff...

 
**Mash**
Everyone's smiling...and in the center of all that, you're smiling, too.

 
**Mash**
I'm not able to properly put it into words, but the photo has a very warm feel, and it's dazzling.

 
**Cleopatra**
You've always been like that, Master.
From the moment you summoned me, to be exact.

 
**Cleopatra**
But...it seemed like you yourself didn't realize it.

 
**Cleopatra**
And so I thought, if you had just one photograph of yourself standing beside me, you would realize just how beautiful you are...

 
**Cleopatra**
And yes, you would understand.
That's what I thought.

 
**Georgios**
Hm... So you went through all this trouble just so you could make Master realize that.

 
**Cleopatra**
Not exactly. That was just the process.
What I truly want to tell Master is beyond that.

 
**Mash**
???

 
**Cleopatra**
You said it right from the beginning, Mash.
I rarely visit My Room. And that's the problem.

 
**Cleopatra**
What I mean is...

 
**Cleopatra**
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE ME OVER MORE OFTEN?

 
**Cleopatra**
Yes, it seems Master is afraid of me, or is keeping [♂ his /♀️ her}
distance from me out of reverence.

 
**Cleopatra**
It's true that I am a beautiful pharaoh. There is obviously a great disparity between our ranks, so being somewhat intimidated is understandable.

 
**Cleopatra**
But that should not matter.
Take a look at the photograph once again.

 
**Cleopatra**
You can see the beautiful Cleopatra and...and the less beautiful, but still very beautiful Master.

 
**Cleopatra**
So, you should have more confidence! At the very least, know that I have absolute confidence in myself.

 
**Cleopatra**
Which means...no matter how plain they look or how boring they act, a human who is able to summon someone as beautiful as me must surely be beautiful!

 
**Mash**
That's...true. Self-centered and maybe unfounded, but true, Cleopatra...

 
**Mash**
But I think the thought behind it is meant to be complimentary to Master...

 
**Mash**
Or rather, now that I think back,
perhaps it's always been that way...?

 
**Georgios**
Hm. A truly noble beauty like her may only be able to compliment people...

 
**Georgios**
...in roundabout ways that are bound to sometimes lead to misunderstandings.

 
**Cleopatra**
Listen, Fujimaru. I know very well that you're the plainest of all plain people.

 
**Cleopatra**
But the mere fact that you are my Master gives you a leg up over all the other boring people out there.

 
**Cleopatra**
That's why you don't have to be so afraid of me, and should interact with me more. I may even listen to some of your requests, too.

 
**Cleopatra**
Of course, this all assumes that you show the utmost reverence and respect for my beauty!

 
**Cleopatra**
Now, is there something you'd like to ask of me? Why don't you grovel at my feet and beg a favor like the powerless human you are?

 
**E：???**
Ultimately, I believe she wanted to let you know that she wants you to rely on her more.

 
**E：???**
Teehee. I guess that's the only way she could convey such a sentiment.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, got it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel like we're closer now.


---
 
**E：???**
Yes. Hearing that from you...

 
**E：???**
While I'm not even close to being as capable as she is, and though saying this may be overstepping my boundaries, I'm relieved.

 
**E：???**
She can be difficult and may be misunderstood quite often...

 
**Cleopatra**
Oh? I thought I heard a familiar voice...

 
**D：???**
Getting...along...beautiful...
My job...here...done...

 
**D：???**
Farewell...
May the pharaoh...be blessed...

 
**Cleopatra**
Oh! Great Medjed! Please wait! Even I acknowledge your form as the embodiment of beauty!

 
**Cleopatra**
Actually, I love you, so I want a photo!
Can I take a picture with you!?

 
**Mash**
Teehee... Until now, perhaps I was keeping my distance from Cleopatra.

 
**Mash**
After all, she's a queen, the world's most beautiful woman, and a pharaoh.

 
**Mash**
But after this ordeal, I feel like I understand her a little more.

 
**Mash**
She may have odd ways of saying things,
but she still lets those she approves of know it.

 
**Mash**
In some ways, she's quite fair.

 
**Mash**
She believes her standards are absolute, and never compromises. She's a pure, strong-willed person.

 
**Mash**
That may be what makes her the ultimate beauty.


<h2>Where the Heart Is</h2>

**Cleopatra**
...The ideal body! That is what I seek!!!

 
**Cleopatra**
Indeed, has there ever been anyone in history who has not endeavored to sculpt their body into a monument to absolute physical perfection?

 
**Cleopatra**
Of course not! And that's why we're here!
Is that clear, Master!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
C-crystal?
 
**Cleopatra**
No! I can tell your heart isn't in this!
I don't need hollow reassurances!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The ideal body...
 
**Cleopatra**
That's right. The ideal body.
Do you know what I mean?

 
**Cleopatra**
...No, I can see you don't.

 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
(Sigh)...

 
**Cleopatra**
So I have to explain this whole thing again, do I?
Well, I won't! Besides, as my secretary, you should already know what I mean!

 
**Cleopatra**
You only get to be a pharaoh's secretary because you truly understand them!

 
**Cleopatra**
Now, begin the preparations!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Preparations?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
To help me get in shape, obviously!

 
**Cleopatra**
You have my permission to activate the simulator!

 
**Cleopatra**
After all, there is no better way to get in shape than exercising, and there is no exercise more effective or beautiful than my Pharaoh Fighting Style!

 
**Cleopatra**
I already practice for an hour every morning to maintain my looks and my health, of course, but that's not the same as using it in live combat.

 
**Cleopatra**
Which is why now is the time for live combat!

 
**Cleopatra**
...Or at least, it would be, if something would attack us. (Sigh) Where's a pack of marauders when you need them?

 
**Cleopatra**
Anyway, since I can't count on actual enemies to invade in accordance with my workout schedule, I decided to compromise and use the simulator with some help from other Heroic Spirits here.

 
**Cleopatra**
I trust you understand all that now?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
More or less!
 
**Cleopatra**
Good! That was a beautiful answer!
Now, let us be on our merry way!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What if someone's already using the simulator?
 
**Cleopatra**
Oh, right. I hadn't thought of that... Well, if that turns out to be the case, that will just mean fate has chosen to aid me by providing me with an opponent!

 


---
 
**Nitocris**
...Yes?

 
**Nitocris**
I was just using the simulator to check up on my battle summons...

 
**Nitocris**
Is there a reason you came all this way?
I don't want to be rude...

 
**Nitocris**
...but couldn't you just set the simulator the way you want for your own training?
Cleopatra, what are you&ndash;

 
**Cleopatra**
No. No, Pharaoh Nitocris.
No more words.

 
**Cleopatra**
What I need right now is not talk, but exercise. Hard, strenuous, fat-burning exercise! I can't possibly get that from mere NPCs.

 
**Cleopatra**
Now go on, don't hold back. Hit me with your best shot! On my honor as pharaoh, I can take whatever you throw at me!

 
**Nitocris**
(Sigh)... All right, if you insist...

 
**Nitocris**
...Are you sure about this, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. Please spar with her.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm her secretary right now, so whatever she says, goes.
 


---
 
**Nitocris**
V-very well then. I'll admit, fighting another Servant should help with my own training too!

 
**Nitocris**
All right, here goes!

 
**Nitocris**
...Come forth, my armies of the dead! Come forth from my mirror, and show my enemies the power of a pharaoh!


**--BATTLE--**

**Cleopatra**
Phew! Not bad!

 
**Cleopatra**
But, it still seems like something's missing...
You weren't holding back, were you, Pharaoh Nitocris?

 
**Nitocris**
No, I was taking it fairly seriously.
But I see that wasn't enough for you.

 
**Cleopatra**
Hmm, I'm afraid not! Between this place and the minions you summoned, this just wasn't what I needed!

 
**Cleopatra**
This is not what I had in mind for my ideal exercise routine. Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know. You want to try a different place?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You want to try the next area in the simulator?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Right!


**--ARROW--**

**Paracelsus**
Well now. I certainly didn't expect to see you here.

 
**Paracelsus**
What's that? You're looking for combat training partners? I see.

 
**Paracelsus**
In that case, perhaps my homunculi and golems would do the trick? I was just trying my hand at some automata as well.

 
**Cleopatra**
Very well. It will be interesting to see how much of a sweat these creatures can help me work up.

 
**Cleopatra**
All right, come at me!
I'll take you all on and look beautiful doing it!


**--BATTLE--**

**Cleopatra**
...Well, they were certainly worthy opponents, but I'm afraid they just aren't beautiful enough for my tastes.

 
**Cleopatra**
Hmm... Finding the ideal exercise routine is a lot more difficult than I expected...

 
**Paracelsus**
Cleopatra, last of the pharaohs, I apologize that my creations failed to meet your expectations.

 
**Cleopatra**
No, it's all right.
I am the one who should apologize.

 
**Cleopatra**
Forgive me for simply moving on without properly rewarding you for your efforts.

 
**Cleopatra**
I'll make it up to you by throwing you the finest banquet you will ever see. Oh, I'll have to invite Pharaoh Nitocris too.

 
**Cleopatra**
Now then...
Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup, I know.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Time for the next area?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Come, let us be on our way!


**--BATTLE--**

**Cleopatra**
That was most satisfying. Just what I would expect from an area modeled after my own Egypt.

 
**Cleopatra**
But, I'm afraid it all feels a bit too familiar.

 
**Cleopatra**
They were certainly strong enough opponents, but it just wasn't quite exciting enough to really make my skin glow!

 
**Cleopatra**
...This really is difficult, isn't it?

 
**Cleopatra**
I guess the ideal workout, and the ideal body aren't things that can be obtained overnight...

 
**Cleopatra**
But I'm not going to give up! Not after I've already come so far! Right, Master!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're definitely not one to give up, that's for sure.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
On to the next area then?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Yes! This time, I'm going to find what I'm looking for!


**--ARROW--**

**Cleopatra**
...
...

 
**Cleopatra**
This is...the ocean.

 
**Cleopatra**
...Why am I doing all this?

 
**Cleopatra**
Why am I putting myself through so much strenuous exercise? Why couldn't I be satisfied with Pharaoh Nitocris's workout, or the desert's?

 
**Cleopatra**
I'm sure those questions have crossed your mind at least once or twice, my secretary.

 
**Cleopatra**
Why am I working so hard to improve a body that is already perfect?

 
**Cleopatra**
I don't blame you for wondering. You must find it more intriguing than any of the Seven Wonders of the World. I doubt even that famous detective could understand.

 
**Cleopatra**
The truth is&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're looking for the ideal body, right?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Is this about Caesar?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Hehe, you really don't understand.
I don't blame you.

 
**Cleopatra**
But my search for the ideal body is not for me.
I seek it for another.

 
**Cleopatra**
Namely&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Caesar?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
...Huh?

 
**Cleopatra**
Uh, y-yes, that's right.
...Wait...

 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Ho-how did you know!?
Are you some kind of genius!?

 
**Cleopatra**
I knew you were a hard worker, Master, but I didn't think you were actually one of the greatest sages of all time... You might even be wiser than Diogenes.

 
**Cleopatra**
A-ahem. I suppose it is obvious by now, but yes, you're right.

 
**Cleopatra**
This is all for my darling Caesar.

 
**Cleopatra**
The ideal workout routine is not to help me achieve an ideal body, but to help Lord Caesar slim down!

 
**Cleopatra**
What sort of arduous battle will best ensure he gets into shape?

 
**Cleopatra**
That's why I've been going to such great lengths...

 
**Cleopatra**
...And now (sigh) I've ended up at the ocean. A virtual ocean that can't possibly lead back to Alexandria.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You really want him to lose weight that badly?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't you love him just the way he is?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
...This isn't just about looks.

 
**Cleopatra**
Though that's not to say looks aren't part of it! They're super important, you know! But I never chose my dear Caesar for his looks alone!

 
**Cleopatra**
...It's my son, Caesarion.

 
**Cleopatra**
My child who faced down Rome all on his own,
and died just a few days after me.

 
**Cleopatra**
The true last pharaoh ever to walk the earth.

 
**Cleopatra**
I...I want my dear Caesar to accept him as his rightful son and heir...

 
**Cleopatra**
...and to do so in the same beautiful body he possessed on that fateful day.

 
**Cleopatra**
...
...

 
**Cleopatra**
I know it's too late to change history. I know the past will stay the past, no matter what he says now.

 
**Cleopatra**
But, even so...I still want him to say it.
Both for my beloved son's sake, and for my own pride.

 
**Cleopatra**
It's the only way my son and I will ever be able to rest in peace...

 
**Caesar**
Are you sure that's what you want?

 
**Caesar**
Wouldn't being at peace mean that you would no longer have the need to materialize in the present world?

 
**Cleopatra**
Lord Caesar!?

 
**Caesar**
You've finally found a Master you trust enough to accompany you wherever you choose to go.

 
**Caesar**
Do you really want to throw that beautiful bond away just because of something I said?

 
**Cleopatra**
I...!

 
**Cleopatra**
Oh, Caesar! Please don't say things like that. I just had this idea when I was washing my face this morning!

 
**Cleopatra**
Please don't make me second-guess my amazingly beautiful decision to see it through now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh, yeah, we can't have that...
 
**Cleopatra**
No, we can't! I'm reminded yet again of just how very good Caesar is with words!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I get ideas when washing my face all the time too.
 
**Cleopatra**
Exactly! They just...come to you, as though they were a revelation from the heavens or something!

 


---
 
**Caesar**
(Hmm, you really are second-guessing yourself now.
Ahh, what a good woman you are.)

 
**Caesar**
(Being around you makes me want to be a better person, and that is no mean feat. But right now, love of my life, I must bite the bullet and tell you what you need to hear.)

 
**Caesar**
Cleopatra, Master there is the only person you have ever known that you are willing to accept as your secretary.

 
**Caesar**
Unlike us, you two had no existing bond to speak of.
It was destiny that brought you two together.

 
**Caesar**
I promise, I'm not going anywhere. So I urge you to cast your mind back and remember once again.

 
**Caesar**
Surely you don't need to hurry to your death so quickly, do you? Yes, when you were alive, your beautiful light was snuffed out all too soon...

 
**Caesar**
...but does that mean you must do the same now?
No, it absolutely does not!

 
**Cleopatra**
Lord Caesar...

 
**Cleopatra**
I didn't know you cared so deeply for me...

 
**Cleopatra**
Or for Master...!

 
**Caesar**
That is why, my beloved Cleopatra...

 
**Caesar**
...I will never lose weight!

 
**Cleopatra**
!!!

 
**Nitocris**
!!!

 
**Caesar**
That is all. Master, I will allow you to continue to shine bright by my Cleopatra's side.

 
**Caesar**
I understand the bond you share is special,
and not at all akin to cheating. So I will allow it!

 
**Caesar**
In turn, my dear Cleopatra...I trust you will allow me a little freedom of my own.

 
**Caesar**
My eye may wander juuust a bit from time to time, but that's not cheating either. Really. I'm talking just a teeensy little bit of ogling.

 
**Cleopatra**
Hell no!

 
**Caesar**
Curses!

 
**Cleopatra**
That request would be enough to ruin a romance that lasted a hundred years, but fortunately, my determination stretches back over two thousand years!

 
**Cleopatra**
It may have taken approximately two thousand and one hundred years, but at last, your time has come! Prepare to die, Lord Caesar! And to finally lose some weight as well!

 
**Caesar**
 
Never!

 
**Cleopatra**
That's the one thing you refuse to back down on, is it! Well, there are some things I won't compromise on, either!

 
**Cleopatra**
Master! My secretary! I'm fairly tired after all that exercising, so it's time for the FP Fighting Style!

 
**Cleopatra**
Don't look at me like you have no clue what FP stands for! It stands for “Final Pharaoh,” of course!

 
**Cleopatra**
Fortunately, my makeup is already perfect for a beachside backdrop! Are you ready to shine bright with me, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll shine as bright as I possibly can!
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Very well then... Let us begin!!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Caesar**
I-impossible...!

 
**Caesar**
I can't believe you saw through my golden sword!

 
**Caesar**
Hmm, maybe you do have a point. As impressive as my swordsmanship is, my body does limit how I can employ it.

 
**Caesar**
Well done, Cleopatra.
And, Master? If I may make one last request?

 
**Caesar**
Please...take care of Cleopatra in my absence!

 
**Caesar**
Ahh... Wait for me, Caesarion!
I'm coming to join you, my son!

 
**Caesarion's Voice**
(Uh, that's okay. I'm fine on my own. Really.)

 
**Cleopatra**
Wha&ndash;

 
**Cleopatra**
 
N-no! No, no, no, no! Caesar is...g-gone...?
This can't be happening...

 
**Cleopatra**
Ahh...! Ahh, ahhh...!
I... I...!

 
**Cleopatra**
What have I done!?

 
**Cleopatra**
 
Caesaaaaaaaaar!

 
**Nitocris**
...
...

 
**Nitocris**
So, um, it turns out I've been here all along, but never mind that. I don't think you have any reason to worry. He didn't disappear; he just changed into his spirit form.

 
**Nitocris**
Besides, this is the simulator. Nobody disappears in here unless there's a really, really serious accident.

 
**Cleopatra**
What!? B-but, but he was shimmering and everything!

 
**Cleopatra**
I thought the only time Heroic Spirits shimmer like that is when their Spirit Core has been destroyed and they're about to completely disappear...

 
**Nitocris**
Well, um, I'm guessing that's because he also has the kind of sparkling charm that you do?

 
**Nitocris**
Maybe just spending so much time with you was enough for it to rub off on him...? Or something like that.

 
**Cleopatra**
!

 
**Cleopatra**
I don't believe it...
Then, this means...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He ran off on you again.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, Cleopatra! It sucks, I know.
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
 
Grrrrrrrrr, I can't believe it! He was shimmering so much I just assumed he was truly disappearing!

 
**Cleopatra**
...Well, there's no point crying about it now. Besides, pharaohs don't get discouraged. Devastatingly depressed at times, maybe, but not discouraged. Besides, that was a long time ago.

 
**Cleopatra**
Anyway, Caesar was right about at least one thing.

 
**Cleopatra**
Master... My very first secretary.

 
**Cleopatra**
Now that I've promoted you to such an esteemed position, I would be a failure as a pharaoh if I didn't ensure you enjoyed each and every day you spent serving me.

 
**Cleopatra**
Wouldn't you agree? Yes, of course you would.
No need to answer that!

 
**Cleopatra**
I want you to feel overwhelming joy and pride in being my secretary, and in having summoned me...

 
**Cleopatra**
...So it's all right if you hold off on completely fulfilling my wish until you do.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does that mean you're okay with Caesar not losing weight then?
 


---
 
**Cleopatra**
Absolutely not!

 
**Cleopatra**
That is an entirely separate issue!

 
**Cleopatra**
Now then, let us go for a walk on this beach until the sun has set! In fact, we should call Mash and have her join us as well. Oh, and Pharaoh Nitocris!

 
**Nitocris**
Yes?

 
**Cleopatra**
I would like to demonstrate the glory of the Double Pharaoh sparkle to my secretary. I trust you don't mind!

 
**Nitocris**
Ah... Must I?

 
**Cleopatra**
I. Trust. You. Don't. Mind?

 
**Nitocris**
(Sigh) Fine, fine. If you insist.

 
**Cleopatra**
Wonderful! I knew you would understand,
queen of the heavens!

 
**Cleopatra**
Very well then...first, I'll need to change into a swimsuit. The finest swimsuit ever made that is sure to suit me per&ndash;

 
**Nitocris**
Oh, in that case, I have an idea. Why don't you try this Medjed outfit made with a new kind of&ndash;

 
**Cleopatra**
No, thank you! I don't have the courage to wear something imitating Lord Medjed!

 
**Cleopatra**
At this moment...

 
**Nitocris**
 
(Shock)

 
**Cleopatra**
...I'm looking for something on the cutting edge of fashion, such as an outfit from Paris Fashion Week!

 
**Cleopatra**
I always shine bright in all my endeavors,
and that's not about to change anytime soon!

 
**Cleopatra**
Now, let us all be on our way!
