# Edward Teach

<h2>A Man's Battle</h2>

**Blackbeard**
Big trouble, Mistah Fujimaru! Big trouble!
There's a big trouble a brewin'!

 
**Mash**
Mistah Blackbeard... I can estimate with 99% probability that it's something stupid, but what is it?

 
**Blackbeard**
Bwaha, Missy Mash has got a sharp tongue on her, don't she? But I like that, I do!

 
**Mash**
...Blackbeard,
Master is actually pretty busy.

 
**Mash**
There's a lot of work to be done with the Servants.
Right, Senpai?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did something happen?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, isn't Mistah Blackbeard...
 


---
 
**Blackbeard**
With all the Grail business goin' on, I forgot about it, but today's an important day in history.

 
**Blackbeard**
I remembered that it's a historical turning point, I did.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Today? Hmm... What happened today?
There's nothing in Chaldea's database.

 
**Blackbeard**
Today's when all the pirates of the Caribbean gather for the biggest event of the high seas!

 
**Blackbeard**
The Pirate Market!
AKA PaiKet, begins today!

 
**Blackbeard**
Now, Missy Mash, Mistah Fujimaru!
Repeat after me!

 
**Blackbeard**
PAIKET!

 
**Fou**
Fou...

 
**Mash**
...So Doctor, about that Singularity.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh right. I rescanned the data and it turns out that era&ndash;

 
**Blackbeard**
Hnnng LOL Just the right amount of salt!
It just makes me wanna try harder!

 
**Blackbeard**
Come on, guys, whadd'ya got to lose?

 
**Blackbeard**
Come with me, and enjoy the flourishment of a new human culture!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess it wouldn't hurt...
 
**Mash**
If you say so, Senpai...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't miss this!
 
**Mash**
Senpai!

 


---
 
**Mash**
Dozens of ships linked into one big event venue.
These people... What are they doing with their lives...

 
**Blackbeard**
LOLOLOL How I've missed that salty Caribbean air!
Ya know, there's something I gotta say here!

 
**Blackbeard**
Caribbean, I'm back!
Bwaha-LOLOLOL! Ahahaha! ROFL!

 
**Pirate**
We've been waiting for you, Mistah Blackbeard!
They only hold the PaiKet every few years!

 
**Pirate**
It's an honor to be here with you,
the famous PaiKet warrior! Ahahaha-LOLOLOL!

 
**Mash**
Um...Mistah Blackbeard, who are these people?

 
**Blackbeard**
They're the comrades I've gathered via the internet! I've prepared carefully in advance.

 
**Blackbeard**
Even I'm not foolish enough to attempt to conquer this place on my own!

 
**Dr. Roman**
So what do you do here, exactly?
It just looks like a bazaar to me...

 
**Blackbeard**
There's records of pirate glories, navigational maps,
rare treasures, legendary treasure maps&ndash;

 
**Blackbeard**
We've got the whole world, right here for the buying! Well? Sounds fun, right? Right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So it's like a flea market?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you after?
 


---
 
**Blackbeard**
That's my Master/Captain/CEO!
Getting right to the point!

 
**Blackbeard**
Today I'm after the legendary pirate Francis Drake's rough sketches!

 
**Blackbeard**
Oh, by roughs, I mean nudes okay?
Not just some crap somebody dashed off either, LOLOL!

 
**Blackbeard**
I mean, I ain't interested in that old hag's nudes!
Not at all! 100%, no way!

 
**Blackbeard**
It's just, you know... For my collection?
I wanna have em? Bwahahah-LOL!

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Those were made with her permission, right?

 
**Pirate Staff**
&ndash;We will now begin the 88th Pirate's Market.
Please remain calm and do not run&ndash;

 
**Blackbeard**
...

 
**Mash**
Looks like it's started.
What's wrong, Mistah Blackbeard?

 
**Blackbeard**
Fool! Call me Cap'n here!
Men, are ye ready!

 
**Pirate**
Aye, aye, Cap'n!

 
**Blackbeard**
Listen up! We're pirates of the Caribbean!
We left our pride and lives behind in the sea!

 
**Blackbeard**
We do what we always do: pillage, plunder, and kill!
That's all there is to it! Let's go, men!

 
**Blackbeard**
First, we start with the night campers,
who are leading the charge toward us! Stay sharp!

 
**Mash**
W-What's happening?

 
**Dr. Roman**
A group's coming up from the rear at incredible speed...

 
**Blackbeard**
YARGH! Send 'em to Davy Jones' locker!
Battle is a party, it's party time!


**--BATTLE--**

**Blackbeard**
Yar, that's the last of 'em!
Hmm? More?

 
**Enemy Pirate**
It's been a long time, Blackbeard... You're going to pay for embarrassing our captain!

 
**Blackbeard**
Hah, I don't even know who ya are!
Hey, Mash, Fujimaru!

 
**Blackbeard**
Go on ahead!
I'm gonna slaughter these guys first!

 
**Mash**
R-Right...
This is a bazaar, isn't it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Cap'n!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't die, Blackbeard!
 


---
 
**Blackbeard**
Huh? Who do ye think yer talkin' to?
I'm Blackbeard, the devil of the Caribbean!

 
**Blackbeard**
I ain't so far gone I need a wet-behind-the-ears kid to be lookin' after me! Get going!

 
**Mash**
L-Let's just go, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Artist Pirate**
Ya just bought the last copy of
"100 Sketches of Francis the Old Hag!"

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was close, huh?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We finally got it!
 


---
 
**Mash**
...L-Looks like we got the last one.
Let's get back to Blackbeard.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Um, well...
What exactly is this?

 
**Fou**
Foou...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, Fou...
I didn't see you there.

 
**Blackbeard**
...Yar, looks like ya pulled it off.

 
**Mash**
Blackbeard!
You're badly hurt!

 
**Blackbeard**
Eh, I'm a pirate... It happens.
Just glad to have me head on me shoulders still.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cap'n! With those wounds...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Blackbeard! Don't die on me!
 


---
 
**Blackbeard**
Yar, look at you, all grown up now...
Hey, I got no regrets. I can die as a pirate.

 
**Blackbeard**
This is the greatest treasure of 'em all... I just wish I could've seen the treasure I sought once before I died...

 
**Blackbeard**
Bye-bye! It was a great life!
Farewell! Gwahahahahaha!

 
**Mash**
Mistah Blackbeard...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mistah Blackbeard...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? Did that just happen?
 


---
 
**Mash**
&ndash;Here's the sketchbook you sought.
Take it and rest in peace.

 
**Fou**
Foou...

 
**Blackbeard**
Bwah!? This is the PaiKet-only Old Hag Sketchbook?
There's a new issue out! A new one! I win!

 
**Blackbeard**
I win at everything! I mean,
I've got huge respect for old hag Francis.

 
**Blackbeard**
Though in my case, I like her, but less as a pirate.

 
**Blackbeard**
More as a Pioneer of the Stars,
I'm a little weird that way, LOL.

 
**Blackbeard**
Maybe it's Ferdinand Magellan's influence, ROFL.
Bwahaha-LOLOLOL, ahem, excuse me.

 
**Blackbeard**
This is what makes PaiKet so great, lolol.
It's what makes me and the hag eternal, LOL!

 
**Dr. Roman**
...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Shall we go home?

 
**Mash**
Let's go home...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's come back next year, okay?
 
**Mash**
Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm tired...
 
**Fou**
Foou...
