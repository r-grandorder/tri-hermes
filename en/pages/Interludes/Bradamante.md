# Bradamante

## Dear Ancestor!

**Bradamante:**
!!!

**Bradamante:**
(Master, Master!)

**Bradamante:**
(Look, over there! Can you believe it!?
That's Lord Hektor!)

**Bradamante:**
(This is amazing!
Lord Hektor is an absolute legend!)

**Bradamante:**
(He's one of the great heroes of the Trojan War, and one of the Nine Worthies spoken about in hushed tones throughout all of history!)

**Bradamante:**
(He's also my and Ruggiero's ancestor!
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh...)

**Bradamante:**
(All this time I've been here, and I still haven't introduced myself properly... Oh gosh!)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. Just try to relax.

**Bradamante:**
(Exhale)... (Inhale)...

**Bradamante:**
(Exhaaaleee)...
Okay, I'm feeling a little calmer now!

**Bradamante:**
Thank you, Master. This is the perfect chance to talk to him. I can't let it go to waste.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why not go rectify that now?

**Bradamante:**
!

**Bradamante:**
...Okay, Master. If you think that's a good idea,
then that's just what I'll do.

---

**Bradamante:**
Here goes nothing!

**Bradamante:**
U-um, excuse me!

**Hektor:**
Hm?

**Bradamante:**
Y-you there, the one with the shining helmet! Are you Lord Hektor, the great hero of the Trojan War!?

**Hektor:**
Hmm...

**Hektor:**
I don't know about the “great hero” part, but if you're looking for Hektor of Troy, you've found him.

**Hektor:**
So what's up, little Bradamante?
What can your old ancestor here do for you?

**Bradamante:**
Well, you see, um...

**Bradamante:**
I still haven't introduced myself properly since coming to Chaldea, so, um, I wanted to rectify that.

**Bradamante:**
It's a pleasure to meet you in person, Lord Hektor!

**Hektor:**
Hey, thanks. Pleasure's all mine.

**Bradamante:**
Um, I was also wondering if, maybe...

**Hektor:**
Yes?

**Bradamante:**
I-if you wouldn't mind, um, maybe...you'd like to join Master and me...

**Bradamante:**
...for tea!? Or some other beverage!?

**Hektor:**
Tea, huh? Hmm...
Well, it's not like I don't have time, but...

**Hektor:**
(Honestly, I don't think we'd have all that much to
talk about. But I can also see Master standing behind
her with [♂ his /♀️ her] hands clasped together begging me to say
yes, so...)

**Hektor:**
Sure, why not? Nothing wrong with the occasional cup of tea, especially for happy occasions.

**Hektor:**
'Course, we didn't have tea back in this old man's time, so drinking was pretty synonymous with alcohol.

**Hektor:**
Alcohol lasts forever, and it's high in nutrients, too. Plus, not every area has plenty of clean, fresh water to go around, you know?

**Bradamante:**
Right! That's how the Kingdom of the
Franks used to be! Well, really...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Didn't that pretty much used to be the case everywhere?

**Bradamante:**
Yes, that's what I've been told!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So alcohol wasn't always a luxury good then.

**Bradamante:**
Not at all. It was once as common and essential to daily life as bread.

---

**Hektor:**
So that's how it was back in the Kingdom of the Franks too, huh. So, does that mean you didn't have tea parties back in your time, either?

**Bradamante:**
That's right! We didn't!

**Hektor:**
I see.
(So why do you seem so happy about that?)

**Bradamante:**
I occasionally got to enjoy Chinese tea whenever I'd meet with Lady Angelica of Cathay...

**Bradamante:**
...but we never had any cultural traditions surrounding tea of our own!

**Bradamante:**
Back then, tea ceremonies and parties and whatnot were still very limited to the East.

**Bradamante:**
Tea didn't become a cultural fixture in Europe until...
Hmm, let me think...

**Bradamante:**
I think Holland was the country that popularized green tea...

**Bradamante:**
...and the British Empire did the same for black tea relatively recently.

**Hektor:**
The British Empire, huh?

**Hektor:**
Hmm... Was that the one that started
in the Isles of Britannia?

**Bradamante:**
That's right!

**Bradamante:**
Back when I was alive, it was known far and wide as the prosperous Kingdom of England.

**Bradamante:**
It's also where Stolfo&ndash;I mean, Astolfo, one of the Twelve Paladins, was born.

**Hektor:**
That Rider with the pink hair, huh?
Well, whaddaya know.

**Bradamante:**
In fact, he's actually a prince to England's royal family, though most of us tend to forget that, including him.

**Hektor:**
No kidding! A prince so scatterbrained he even forgets he's a prince, huh? Hahaha, that's priceless!

**Hektor:**
I know a scatterbrained prince myself, but it sounds like that one handily takes the cake, amazingly.

**Hektor:**
Something tells me we'd get along nicely.

**Paris:**
Achoo!

**Paris:**
(Sniffle) That's weird.
Can Servants even catch colds?

**Nightingale:**
A cold, is it?
Well that won't do at all, Paris.

**Nightingale:**
You might need to get a shot.
Come with me so I can take a look at you.

**Paris:**
Aw maaan...

**Hektor:**
The Kingdom of England, aka the British Empire from the Isles of Britannia, huh.

**Hektor:**
Wait. Aren't the Isles of Britannia where&ndash;

**Bradamante:**
...Yes.

**Bradamante:**
Britain is the island where Prince Aeneas of Troy's descendants ended up settling down.

**Bradamante:**
And it's where they went on to found the glorious Kingdom of Britain.

**Bradamante:**
But a few hundred years later...

**Bradamante:**
...the last king of Britain, Arthur Pendragon,
King of Knights, lost his final battle...

**Bradamante:**
...and after the Saxons migrated, the Kingdom of Britain&ndash;

**Hektor:**
That was when the last vestiges of Trojan lineage vanished from the face of the Earth. Right?

**Bradamante:**
...

**Hektor:**
Well hey, what do they say in the East?
Land outlasts kingdoms?

**Hektor:**
Just because a nation is gone doesn't mean its people disappear. Not to mention its land, oceans, and rivers all stick around, too.

**Hektor:**
It's no different with feelings. Losing a war sucks, but it doesn't mean everything's gone forever.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Like, say...

---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bradamante and Ruggiero.

---

**Bradamante:**
...Hey, yeah!

**Hektor:**
There you go. Troy might've lost spectacularly and faded away, but you're still here.

**Hektor:**
And just look at how well you and this old man's other descendants turned out.

**Hektor:**
I'm relieved, really. It feels good to see your blood, sweat, and tears still be around in later generations.

**Hektor:**
Really, when you think about it, what would it say about us if we let a little war or two eradicate us completely?

**Hektor:**
That's it.
I can tell you grew up strong, little Bradamante.

**Hektor:**
...That being said.

**Hektor:**
All of that goes out the window when we're talking about all of humanity possibly being destroyed.

**Hektor:**
Man, as if dealing with a single nation going away wasn't enough of a pain in the neck.

**Bradamante:**
You're right!

**Bradamante:**
We can't let anyone bleach all of human life away!
We have to restore humanity, no matter what!

**Gareth:**
...

**Gareth:**
...Oh gosh, that conversation between Sir Hektor and Lady Bradamante I happened to overhear was so inspiring!

**Gareth:**
Now what am I going to do?

**Mordred:**
Jack shit, that's what.

**Mordred:**
You shoulda just kept on walkin', but instead,
you had to stop and hide like some kinda idiot.

**Gareth:**
Don't call me an idiot!

**Mordred:**
I'll call you whatever the hell I want, idiot!

**Gareth:**
Can't you tell I'm trying to be considerate and not interrupt their conversation!?

**Gareth:**
Also! Doesn't Lady Bradamante...

**Gareth:**
...remind you of me?

**Mordred:**
...You think?

**Gareth:**
I can just tell she's a really hard worker, you know?

**Gareth:**
And Sir Lancelot, hehe, has praised me directly for my work ethic! More than once, even!

**Gareth:**
So we're basically two peas in a pod!

**Mordred:**
Haaa?
(Special Translation: You really think so?)

**Hektor:**
Hm? Something wrong?

**Bradamante:**
I sensed somebody watching us!

**Hektor:**
Eh, now that you mention it, I can feel a few eyes on us. Ah well, it's probably just some of our Chaldea compatriots, so I don't think it's anything to&ndash;

**Bradamante:**
You! Are you watching us?!

**Bradamante:**
Yes, you! Don't bother trying to hide!
Come on out where we can see you!

**Man in Shadow:**
Oh, uh...

**Man in Shadow:**
I wasn't trying to hide, I promise. I was just kinda...stuck. ('Cause it was too awkward to go out.)

**Mandricardo:**
But I don't want to give you the wrong impression, so...
I'm sorry.

**Bradamante:**
I know you!
You're Mandricardo!

**Hektor:**
Is that so.

**Mandricardo:**
...!

**Hektor:**
Hm?

**Mandricardo:**
I-I... Um...
H-hey.

**Mandricardo:**
I, uh, I really wasn't trying to eavesdrop, I promise. I just happened to pass by, that's all.

**Bradamante:**
...

**Mandricardo:**
...

**Mandricardo:**
...Uh, yeah, so.

**Mandricardo:**
I've got, uh, you know, training and stuff, so...
I'll get out of your hair now.

**Mandricardo:**
...

**Mandricardo:**
...

**Mandricardo:**
Um... Can I ask you something?

**Bradamante:**
Of course!

**Mandricardo:**
Why're you following me? I was planning on training alone today (read: like always), so...

**Bradamante:**
...Are you sure?

**Mandricardo:**
I'm sure.

**Hektor:**
I'm only here 'cause Bradamante and Master grabbed my hands and dragged me here, by the way.

**Bradamante:**
(Gasp) I-I-I-I'm so sorry, Lord Hektor!
I wasn't even thinking!

**Bradamante:**
I was just so anxious, and you're just so f-fatherly that I grabbed your hand without realizing.

**Hektor:**
Hey, I get it.
That kind of thing just happens sometimes.

**Hektor:**
So, anxious, huh? I didn't know you cared about Mandricardo that much.

**Bradamante:**
I... I, uh...

**Bradamante:**
Ummm...
Well...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it, Bradamante?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You know, you do seem kind of...fixated on Mandricardo.

---

**Bradamante:**
Well, um... How can I put this...
Gnnn!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you two know each other or something?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Weren't you guys enemies when you were alive?

---

**Bradamante:**
Yes, we did.

**Bradamante:**
King Mandricardo of the Tatars is the son of King Agrican, who was killed by the de facto leader of the Twelve Paladins, Roland!

**Bradamante:**
He came across Lord Hektor's shield and armor over the course of his travels, and then tried to get his hands on the legendary sword Durendal...

**Bradamante:**
...so that he could complete one of the Nine Worthies' armor sets and go after Roland, holder of said sword, to avenge his father's death!

**Bradamante:**
In short, he's the paladins' sworn enemy!
Which is why I...!

**Mandricardo:**
...

**Hektor:**
Sworn enemy? Really?

**Hektor:**
C'mon, that was a long time ago, right? Not to mention it was back when you were both still alive.

**Hektor:**
Now you're both Servants&ndash;shadows of humanity sworn to serve the same Master.

**Hektor:**
Do you really need to bring old quarrels into Chaldea, especially after they've long been dead and buried?

**Bradamante:**
(Gasp of realization)

**Bradamante:**
Y-you're right...
It's just as you say, Lord Hektor!

**Bradamante:**
I'm so sorry, King Mandricardo. I was way out of line.
I hope you can forgive my foolish behavior.

**Mandricardo:**
Uh, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

**Bradamante:**
Of course you're not our sworn enemy.

**Bradamante:**
Our only sworn enemies are Morgan the Witch, Great King Agramante, and Demogorgon the Demon God!

**Bradamante:**
What you are, King Mandricardo, is...

**Mandricardo:**
Yeah...?

**Bradamante:**
Our rival!

**Bradamante:**
You were the powerful warrior king who went toe to toe with both Ruggiero and Roland!

**Bradamante:**
You were a fearsome rival in every sense of the word, and I owe you an apology for ever insinuating otherwise!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Heartily nod in assent)

---

**Mandricardo:**
I-I, uh... I'm not really sure what you're going on about, but...

**Mandricardo:**
S-so you consider me your rival, huh?
Well, thanks. That's nice of you.

**Bradamante:**
Once again, I ask that you please forgive my foolish behavior, King Mandricardo!

**Bradamante:**
If there is anything I can do to make it up to you, anything at all, please don't hesitate to let me know!

**Mandricardo:**
...Uh, that's okay.

**Mandricardo:**
Really, you don't have to worry about it.
It's fine.

**Mandricardo:**
(At this point, I just wanna hurry up and get back to my room already...)

**Mandricardo:**
Having you apologize all over the top and formal like this is honestly weirding me out more, so... Let's just let bygones be bygones, all right?

**Mandricardo:**
...

**Mandricardo:**
(D-damn, talk about a radiant smile...)

**Bradamante:**
So you forgive me!!!?

**Bradamante:**
Oh thank you, King Mandricardo! I had no idea you were such a kind and magnanimous man.

**Bradamante:**
If only Ruggiero had had a chance to get to know you, I'm sure he would have also&ndash;

**Energetic Voice:**
I see how it is!

**Hektor:**
Hm? Isn't that&ndash;

**Bradamante:**
Who goes there!?

**Energetic Voice:**
Yesterday's enemy!

**Energetic Voice:**
Is today's friend!

**Energetic Voice:**
That's just what's going on here, right?
What a wonderful expression!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gareth!

**Gareth:**
That's right! It's me, Gareth!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uh-oh. If you're here in full armor, does that mean

**Gareth:**
Hehehehe, your instincts are spot on, Master.

---

**Gareth:**
Thanks to a series of increasingly unlikely coincidences, I heard everything while I was passing by! Just sit back and leave this all to me!

**Hektor:**
Uh, there's really nothing to leave, since we're not arguing anymore...

**Gareth:**
Lady Bradamante...in the spirit of deepening our
friendship, what would you say to a lancing duel!?

**Hektor:**
Uh, I really don't think there's any need to go to that kind of trou&ndash;

**Bradamante:**
!!!

**Bradamante:**
That...

**Bradamante:**
...sounds like a wonderful idea!
Would you be willing to join us, King Mandricardo!?

**Bradamante:**
I would love to try sparring with you and Lady Gareth!

**Mandricardo:**
N-nah, I'm good... (Glance)

**Bradamante:**
(Glance)

**Gareth:**
(Glance)

**Hektor:**
Why're you all looking at me!?

**Hektor:**
Don't worry about me. You're all young and full of pep, so go ahead and act like it.

**Hektor:**
I'll just be over here watching from the side&ndash;

**Bradamante:**
(Lord Hektor!?)

**Gareth:**
(The great hero of Troy!?)

**Mandricardo:**
(Lord Hektor, one of the Nine Worthies...
is going to watch me!?)

**Mandricardo:**
I don't have a lance, but will a wooden sword do!?

**Gareth:**
Of course!

**Bradamante:**
Certainly!

**Bradamante:**
Master! I know this is short notice, but would you be so kind as to lend me your aid!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You got it!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Gareth and Mandricardo vs. Bradamante and me, huh? Let's do it!

---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Bradamante:**
Here goes!
Noble Phantasm, True Name release...

**Bradamante:**
Bouclier d'Atlante!!!!

**Narration:**
...And, that was how it went.

**Narration:**
After they finished working up a good sweat in the simulated training battle...

**Narration:**
...the youngsters all went on to take a tea break together, or so I'm told.

**Narration:**
As for this old man, just listening in on their conversation is enough for me.

**Narration:**
Turns out, there's something kind of nice about your descendants laughing and having fun with new friends.

**Narration:**
Even a twisted, scruffy old man like
me can't help but crack a smile.

**Bradamante:**
Lord Hektor!

**Bradamante:**
What are you doing over there in the corner?
Come join us! Everyone's dying to talk to you!

**Bradamante:**
Come on, over here!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Go on, Hektor. It'll make their day.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's too soon for you to think about retiring just yet, Hektor!

---

**Hektor:**
...Well, all right. If you insist, Master.

**Hektor:**
I guess I can tell you all one of my Aias stories.

**Bradamante:**
!!!

**Bradamante:**
J-j-j-just a moment! Y-y-y-you mean you were friends with Aias the Great, Lord Hektor!?

**Bradamante:**
Oh my gosh! Then we need to get King Iskandar and Alexander down here, too!

**Bradamante:**
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh!
