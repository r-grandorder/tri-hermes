# Sigurd

## With Neither Mass Nor Shape, Yet Real

**Narration:**
...My inner fire continues to burn.

**Narration:**
It scorches my body, singes my heart,
sears my passion, and sublimates my bliss.

**Narration:**
Even after all this time,
my flames show not a single sign of deterioration.

**Narration:**
They reject the cold,
and melt any ice or snow that draws near.

**Narration:**
Even now, this power that lies within
me burns as fiercely as ever.

**Narration:**
Yes...even now.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stew's ready, Sigurd.


---

**Sigurd:**
You are too kind, Master.

**Sigurd:**
While we Servants have no need for sustenance, I would be happy to partake if there is enough to go around.

**Mash:**
Oh yes, there's plenty. So much that you'd
be doing us a favor by helping us eat it.

**Fou:**
Fou fou.

**Martha:**
I'm so sorry. I always seem to end up making enough to feed a whole family when it's my turn to cook.

**Martha:**
I'm sure it would be great if there were a large number of us camping out, but when it's only a few of us, I always feel like I'm being careless and wasteful.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, as far as I'm concerned, the important thing is that your food is yummy.

**Martha:**
Oh, well thank you, Master. I'm glad to hear that.
We cooks can always use more positive feedback.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't mind. It's like a decadent feast!

**Martha:**
Well, that's kind of you to say, Master.
...That WAS a compliment, right?


---

**Sigurd:**
Hmm, this food is somehow...heartwarming.
Is this what home cooking usually tastes like?

**Martha:**
I'm not sure. This is usually what meals were
like back when I cooked for my own family...

**Martha:**
...but I don't know if that alone
qualifies it as home cooking.

**Martha:**
Still, as long as the food is hot and nutritious, and everyone can relax and be themselves while they eat it, I think that's all you need.

**Sigurd:**
I see, I see.

**Sigurd:**
I ask because, as something of an older hero myself,
I tend to forget what home cooking was like.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You do?


---

**Sigurd:**
I do.

**Sigurd:**
You see... (Munch) While my mother did raise me...
(Munch, munch)

**Martha:**
Stop that! Didn't your mother teach you not to talk with your mouth full? A great hero should be setting a much better example!

**Sigurd:**
...Yes, you're right. My apologies.(Munch, munch)...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Now he's savoring every bite...)


---

**Martha:**
...Well, that doesn't mean we need to eat in complete silence, either. I'm happy to talk during meals, as long as we don't do so while chewing.

**Sigurd:**
Good point.

**Sigurd:**
...My father, the great warrior Sigmund,
died in battle when I was still a baby.

**Martha:**
...

**Martha:**
I see. I'm sorry for your loss.

**Sigurd:**
Fortunately, I was not yet of fighting age, or he may have given me a baby battle instead of a baby bottle.

**Fou:**
Fou!?

**Martha:**
Bwa!?

**Martha:**
Why would you say such a thing!?
It doesn't even make sense!

**Martha:**
Gah! Never mind!
Let's just forget that last part!

**Sigurd:**
Forgive me. Once I get a joke in my head,
I simply cannot stop myself from saying it.

**Sigurd:**
Even my beloved has told me less is more
when it comes to my attempts at humor.

**Sigurd:**
At any rate, after my father's death, my mother took a new husband, and a blacksmith friend of the family was entrusted with my care.

**Mash:**
And that was&ndash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean Regin?

**Sigurd:**
Indeed, I do.

**Sigurd:**
If you are familiar with my legend,
that will save us time.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What was this blacksmith like?

**Sigurd:**
His name was Regin,
and he raised me as though I were his own son.


---

**Mash:**
Was he strict?

**Sigurd:**
Of course.

**Sigurd:**
He had to be, to ensure I would grow up to be a hero.

**Sigurd:**
Thus, I was trained to be a hero from a very young age.

**Narration:**
I was taught swordsmanship. Spear handling.
Archery. Axe theory.

**Narration:**
I learned how to fight with every weapon under the sun, and still I hungered greedily for even more knowledge.

**Narration:**
My curriculum also included mandatory physical training.

**Narration:**
From sunrise to sunset, I would run nonstop across the plains without disturbing so much as a blade of grass.

**Narration:**
I learned how to hunt beasts,
and how to incapacitate people.

**Narration:**
I mastered ways to defeat soldiers, warriors, and heroes, and how to fight on equal ground against those of more demonic natures.

**Narration:**
My training began practically the day I was born. As long as I can remember, I knew I was destined to become a hero, and had made my peace with it.

**Narration:**
But despite what you might think,
I did not think of it as a burden...

**Sigurd:**
...No, on second thought, I suppose I did.

**Narration:**

The words were out of my mouth
before I knew what I was saying.

**Martha:**
I see... I don't blame you.
I can only imagine how hard that must have been.

**Martha:**
Though I am surprised to hear you say that, Sigurd. You always seemed like the type to keep those kinds of thoughts to yourself.

**Sigurd:**
True, I suppose I usually am.
But in this case...

**Sigurd:**
I thought that with my beloved elsewhere, and only a few comrades in arms I trust with my life here...

**Sigurd:**
...I could permit myself a moment of vulnerability and share how I truly feel.

**Mash:**
...

**Martha:**
...

**Martha:**
Ahem! W-well go on, keep eating. The food's
certainly not getting any warmer, after all.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You caught Martha completely off guard!


---

**Martha:**
What did I just say!?
...Still, can you blame me?

**Martha:**
I think anyone would be touched to be trusted so implicitly by someone from such a different time and place.

**Sigurd:**
Hahaha, I do apologize if I embarrassed you.

**Martha:**
At any rate, I can scarcely imagine how hard
that kind of life must have been for you.

**Martha:**
But if nothing else, I can certainly pray for you.

**Martha:**
Consider it a sign of respect for the conviction that helped you get through those hard times and become the hero you are today.

**Sigurd:**
You may well be right, Lady Martha.

**Sigurd:**
It was a difficult time in my life, to be sure...

**Sigurd:**
...but since I would not be here today had I not experienced it, I can look back on it fondly.

**Sigurd:**
That being said, if I were to encounter Regin now,
I have no doubt I would punch him right in his face again.

**Fou:**
Fou fou...

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.

**Sigurd:**
While we are on the subject&ndash;I would not normally tell you this next part, but since it is already part of my legend, I see no reason to refrain.

**Sigurd:**
Unfortunately, Regin deceived me. He planned to make off with the evil dragon's treasure after I slew it...

**Sigurd:**
...even if it meant killing me to get me out of his way.

**Mash:**
Oh gosh. That's...terrible.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed. But by then, he was no match for me,
and I quickly turned the tables on him.

**Martha:**
I, uh, I see. You're very proud of that, aren't you?

**Sigurd:**
Of course.

**Sigurd:**
I've never thought of myself as a righteous hero...

**Sigurd:**
...but surely, anyone who could stoop so low as to stab a child he raised in the back must be irredeemably evil.

**Sigurd:**
So I think my killing him in retaliation must therefore have been a righteous act.

**Martha:**
Yes, you do have a point. There certainly isn't much good to say about a man who would betray his charge for riches.

**Mash:**
...Do you hate Regin for what he did to you, Sigurd?

**Sigurd:**
......

**Sigurd:**
No, I don't think so. I don't have much love for him now, but I wouldn't say I especially hate him either.

**Narration:**

No, I don't hate him. But it did pain me that things turned out how they did.

**Sigurd:**
If nothing else, I do owe him a debt of gratitude for his work raising me to be the hero I became.

**Sigurd:**
And above all, I would never have met my
beloved had he not set me on that path.

**Sigurd:**
I suppose it just goes to show there is a thin line
between good fortune and bad.

**Martha:**
Don't you think you're being a little overly optimistic?

**Sigurd:**
......Now that you mention it...!

**Martha:**
Oh come now!
Surely there's no need to be that shocked about it!

**Sigurd:**
It's just that I'm usually so straitlaced that no one has ever called me optimistic before.

**Sigurd:**
I never even realized it until now...
I see. So I'm an optimist...

**Martha:**
Arguably, one of the best parts of being a Servant is
getting to better understand who we are even after we die.

**Martha:**
Now that you know you're an optimist, you should work on polishing your optimistic nature.

**Sigurd:**
I see.

**Sigurd:**
From where I stand, it appears you
are also an optimist, Lady Martha.

**Sigurd:**
For it is through your heart of iron wrapped in gentle
mercy that you bring hope to people everywhere.

**Martha:**
Oh?... Now that you mention it,
I suppose I probably am an optimist.

**Martha:**
But that's okay. I think it's much better to be an incurable optimist than to bemoan the state of the world without doing anything to improve it.

**Sigurd:**
With that attitude, it is little wonder you became a saint. My mask&ndash;er, hat is off to you.

**Martha:**
It's a little embarrassing,
hearing you praise me like that...

**Martha:**
Thank you once again for this meal, O Lord.

**Martha:**
At any rate, I'm still wondering if there truly
is an evil dragon in this Singularity.

**Martha:**
What do you make of it, Sieg?

**Sieg:**
They're definitely the same species as me...
Well, that might not be entirely accurate...

**Sieg:**
But whatever species they are, I can definitely sense
them here. Also, on a completely different subject,
the stew is delicious, Martha.

**Martha:**
Thank you, Sieg.
I made sure to season your bowl extra strong.

**Sieg:**
I appreciate that.

**Sieg:**
My tongue isn't as sensitive as humans', so I need strong flavors just to taste anything at all.

**Sieg:**
...Mmm, this really is delicious.

**Martha:**
I'm glad to hear that.

**Martha:**
All right, once you're done with dinner, we'll get back to searching. And this time, we're going to find those dragons and take care of them once and for all.

**Martha:**
And by take care of, I mean confront them and lay them to rest with mercy and prayer.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lead the way, Ms. Iron Fist!

**Martha:**
How many times do I have to tell you!? I'm a Rider!
A Rider devoted solely to healing others!

**Sieg:**
(Why is she upset?
Does she not like being called “Ms.”?)


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
With a lineup like this, I don't see how we can lose.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.

**Sigurd:**
Between two renowned dragon slayers like myself and
Lady Martha, I almost feel sorry for our targets.


---

**Mash:**
All right then, shall we get going?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I was kind of hoping for seconds...)

**Martha:**
Don't worry, Master. If you liked my stew that much, I'd be happy to make another pot for you after we get back.

**Sigurd:**
Could I partake in this new pot of stew as well?

**Martha:**
Well of course. Like I said, I always make too much anyway. When it comes to cooking for large groups, I daresay I could even give Cat a run for her money.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do it!

**Sieg:**
Right.

**Sieg:**
I like to think I've known for some
time now how Siegfried fights...

**Sieg:**
...so I'm really looking forward to fighting
alongside you for the first time, Sigurd.

**Sigurd:**
I see. Well, since one of a hero's duties is to
live up to young boys' expectations for them...

**Sigurd:**
...I'll have to do my best to show off what I can do then.


---

**Narration:**
I don't smile. I can't smile.
I don't need to smile.

**Narration:**
I don't get angry. I can't get angry.
I don't need to get angry.

**Narration:**
I don't get sad. I can't get sad.
I don't need to get sad.

**Narration:**
...Nor do I ever particularly wish for happiness.

**Narration:**
The blacksmith who raised me said that was fine.

**Narration:**
He said I was a weapon, a blade, a guardian meant to protect those who can't protect themselves.

**Narration:**
He also said if I was going to be a hero, I shouldn't try to develop a personality of my own, as doing so would only end in tragedy one day.

**Narration:**
Though his words stung, I couldn't deny that there was a hint of truth to them.

**Narration:**
If one were to assemble a group of one million people, ten thousand of them would no doubt be well above average.

**Narration:**
Let's say that from those ten thousand,
a hundred of the very best were chosen.

**Narration:**
That would mean that there were no fewer than a hundred people who excelled in every possible way&ndash;mental, physical, and spiritual alike.

**Narration:**
And among those hundred...
there is one truly exceptional being.

**Narration:**
They may be descended from gods...bring miracles
 to life...have wills like solid steel...or possess
inhuman power.

**Narration:**
Those beings are called heroes.

**Narration:**
They are birthed by the tides of history,
and cultivated by the passions of their fellows.

**Narration:**
I expect that I, too, am one of them.

**Narration:**
As long as this power of mine can be of use to the world, I have no qualms about materializing and wielding my sword.

**Narration:**
But...there is also something else.
An itch that is somehow indescribably pleasant.

**Narration:**
Something about it feels nearly dreamlike.
It's almost as if&ndash;

**Martha:**
#### Sigurd!

**Sigurd:**
...!

**Martha:**
What happened!? How could a warrior of
your caliber become so distracted!?

**Sieg:**
Were you so nice and full from that delicious
meal that you got sleepy or something?

**Sigurd:**
No, nothing like that. Forgive me.
I was simply a bit lost in thought.

**Martha:**
Oh, thank goodness. I was worried you had
been hit with some sort of mental attack.

**Martha:**
Though in that case, I'm impressed you can afford to get lost in thought while we face such a fearsome opponent.

**Sigurd:**
I'm sorry.

**Sigurd:**
Rest assured, I will do everything I can to allay your concerns, starting right now.

**Sigurd:**
What are your orders, Master!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hit it hard, and bring it down quickly.

**Sigurd:**
Understood. Then I would ask that you please
send some more magical energy my way.

**Sigurd:**
Thank you, Master.
All right, beast...have at you!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Martha, Sieg, I'd like you to back Sigurd up.

**Martha:**
Leave it to me. I'll make sure to heal every injury sustained, down to the slightest scratch.

**Sieg:**
I'll cover you with my Noble Phantasm.

**Sigurd:**
Then I'll lead the charge against this beast.
Let's go!


---

**--BATTLE--**

**Sigurd:**
There we go.
All the creatures have been destroyed, Master.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Great work, team!


---

**Sigurd:**
Thank you.

**Martha:**
Don't let your guard down just yet.
We still haven't finished repairing this Singularity.

**Martha:**
And Sigurd, I think you still owe us an explanation
for why you spaced out in the middle of battle.

**Sigurd:**
Yes, I suppose I do.

**Sigurd:**
Letting your mind wander in the heat of battle is inexcusable.

**Narration:**

Still...

**Sigurd:**
I got careless.
I'm sorry.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-it's okay. These things happen.


---

**Sieg:**
I'm surprised. I never thought I'd see the
day when you of all people slipped up.

**Mash:**
I was kind of surprised, too...

**Martha:**
...(Sigh) Fortunately, we were able to cover for your mistake this time, but we might not be so lucky next time.

**Martha:**
Still, whatever's going on, if you believe you can figure it out on your own, please make sure you do so.

**Sigurd:**
I will. Don't worry. It won't happen again.

**Sieg:**
...?

**Sigurd:**
Is something wrong?

**Sieg:**
Oh, no, it's nothing.
Just my imagination.

**Sieg:**
(Though for a moment there, it really did look to me like he was enjoying himself...)

**Sieg:**
...

**Sieg:**
I'm sensing more dragonkin a little further ahead.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can you tell how many there are?


---

**Sieg:**
There are lots of small ones, two medium-sized ones,
and one big one.

**Sieg:**
Based on everything I've sensed so far, I'm guessing the small ones are wyverns, the medium ones are dragons...

**Sieg:**
...and the big one is a Fafnir.

**Sigurd:**
Then perhaps this Singularity will
go away once we take care of them?

**Martha:**
I think it probably will, yes.
Though of course, that's easier said than done.

**Martha:**
These evil Fafnir dragons are always formidable foes I prefer to avoid, no matter how many times I've faced them.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.

**Sieg:**
Come to think of it, Siegfried says he doesn't remember anything about his own battle against Fafnir.

**Sieg:**
He says even a single battle with stakes as
high as those, where even one small mistake can lead to your
death, is enough to drive a person to insanity...

**Sieg:**
And since his went on for so long, he no longer has
any recollection of how he managed to come out on top.

**Sigurd:**
It's true. That sort of thing is quite
common in fiercely fought battles.

**Sigurd:**
While I also remember that I won my battle against Fafnir, I couldn't tell you how I did so.

**Sigurd:**
Much as I wish I could.

**Martha:**
Well, I assume you at least used that sword against it.

**Sigurd:**
That much is certain, yes.
Still...it's strange.

**Sigurd:**
I'm still remembered as a heroic dragon slayer to this day, even though it's been a staggeringly long time since I accomplished that feat.

**Sigurd:**
...But right now, I think I remember my ordinary life much more than I do that fearsome battle.

**Sigurd:**
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.

**Martha:**
Now you really aren't sounding like yourself. Of course
it's a good thing, Sigurd. Of that, I have no doubt.

**Sigurd:**
I hope you're right.

**Sigurd:**
Maybe the same will be true for this journey to save humanity as well, and I'll remember the ordinary days far better than I will my battles.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's probably a good thing.


---

**Sigurd:**
Do you think so, Master?

**Sigurd:**
I see... That's very reassuring.

**Sieg:**
I might just be imagining things, but I'm sensing there are even more creatures in the cave up ahead now than there were earlier.

**Sigurd:**
Well, that's not good.
They must be birthing more to increase their numbers.

**Martha:**
That can't be right!
How could they possibly grow up so fast!?

**Sigurd:**
Anything is possible in a Singularity.

**Sigurd:**
They may be close to a powerful leyline, or they may have attained the power of a Holy Grail...

**Sigurd:**
Either way, the sooner we eliminate
the threat, the better.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that!


---

**--ARROW--**

**Martha:**
Yikes! They're absolutely everywhere!

**Mash:**
It's just like what happened in Orleans.

**Mash:**
We need to hurry, or they'll start reproducing
faster than we can eradicate them!

**Mash:**
Master!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're counting on you to help us tip the scales with the big one, Sigurd!

**Sigurd:**
Consider it done!

**Mash:**
We'll do our best to clear the way for you!
Good luck, Sigurd!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's start by taking care of as many of the smaller ones as we can!

**Martha & Sieg:**
Understood!

**Sigurd:**
Indeed. We must do something about
the dragonkin first and foremost!


---

**--BATTLE--**

**Sigurd:**
Now!

**Sigurd:**
My demonic sword is complete; my ultimate technique
is ready. The time of your demise is at hand!

**Sigurd:**
#### Bölverkr Gram!!!

**Mash:**
You did it! The enemy has completely vanished!

**Sigurd:**
Good.

**Martha:**
#### Booyah!

**Martha:**
...Ahem.
Wonderful job, everyone.

**Martha:**
It shouldn't be long before this
Singularity repairs itself now.

**Sieg:**
Fujimaru&ndash;I mean, Master.

**Sieg:**
Shall we?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hell yeah we shall.


---

**Sigurd:**
Oh?

**Sieg:**
Wooo.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wooo!


---

**Sigurd:**
What was that?

**Sieg:**
It's called a high five.

**Sieg:**
I'm no expert, but apparently, it's some kind of ritual you do once a job is complete.

**Sigurd:**
Hmm.
Then I think I'll do the same.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wooo!


---

**Sigurd:**
W-wooo.

**Sigurd:**
...
...Hmm. This is nice.

**Mash:**
Great work today, everyone.
Let's head back now, shall we?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Way to go, guys!


---

**Sigurd:**
Thank you.

**Narration:**
Strangely, I've found myself smiling
much more ever since coming to Chaldea.

**Narration:**
I can't yet tell if that's a good thing,
or a bad thing.

**Narration:**
Heroes aren't supposed to smile themselves.
They're supposed to protect others' smiles.

**Narration:**
I don't remember if Regin told me that,
or if I said it myself...

**Narration:**
But either way, the environment I'm in now is like nothing I could have imagined back when I was still alive.

**Narration:**
As a result, I think that, maybe...

**Narration:**
...I may have grown a little weaker.

**--ARROW--**

**Sigurd:**
...So please, give it to me straight, Master.

**Sigurd:**
Do you think I've gotten weaker?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If this is you weak, I can't imagine what strong looks like.

**Mash:**
It's true.

**Mash:**
We would have had a much more difficult time
against Fafnir without your help.

**Siegfried:**
There you have it, Lord Sigurd. And I too can vouch that you are still as strong as ever.

**Siegfried:**
Tell us, why would you think otherwise?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not even a little.

**Siegfried:**
Master is right.

**Siegfried:**
You are every bit as strong as you ever were.

**Siegfried:**
Tell us, what in the world made you think otherwise?


---

**Sigurd:**
Well...

**Sigurd:**
For one, the fact that I let
my guard down on the battlefield.

**Sigurd:**
But more significantly, it is the fact that I
was once able to defeat Fafnir on my own...

**Sigurd:**
...yet this time, I was unable to do so without
assistance from other Servants.

**Sigurd:**
The only explanation I could think of
was that...I must have grown weaker.

**Siegfried:**
True, there are definitely cases where we Servants
are weaker now than when we were alive.

**Siegfried:**
For example, as a Saber,
I can no longer use my Tarnkappe.

**Siegfried:**
In a vacuum, one could indeed conclude that we have grown weaker.

**Sigurd:**
I knew it...

**Siegfried:**
However...

**Siegfried:**
It might sound contradictory, but I'm also certain I don't feel any weaker now than I did when I was alive.

**Siegfried:**
And the reason for that...is our Master.

**Siegfried:**
Well, [♂ him /♀️ her] and the other companions
alongside whom we've fought.

**Siegfried:**
While these kinds of circumstances would never come about during an ordinary Holy Grail War, they allow us to draw on this power.

**Sigurd:**
...

**Sigurd:**
...I see. Yes, you're right.
Thank you, Lord Siegfried.

**Sigurd:**
How can I repay you for your help?

**Siegfried:**
If you'd like to repay me, you can do so by sparring with a couple of people I know.

**Sigurd:**
Oh?

**Siegfried:**
...Hehehe.

**Siegfried:**
In fact, this sparring session might just
help you truly understand what I mean.

**Sigurd:**
...?

**Sigurd:**
Good day. My name is Sigurd,
and I'll be your sparring partner today.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Hell yeah! Siegfried told me all aboutcha.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
This oughta get me another step closer
ta bein' a bona fide swordmaster!

**Sieg:**
I'm a Caster, not a Saber...but I still tend to get involved in a lot of sword fights.

**Sieg:**
So I think this sparring session will
be extremely educational for me.

**Sigurd:**
...
...Hehe.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Somethin' wrong, Sigurd?

**Sigurd:**
Oh, sorry. Not to worry, everything is fine.

**Sigurd:**
Now, shall we get started?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm gonna fight on their side, 'kay?


---

**Sigurd:**
Understood.

**Sigurd:**
Then let us begin!

**Sigurd:**
You're fast, but your strokes are all over the place!

**Sigurd:**
It's natural to hesitate at times
when using multiple weapons...

**Sigurd:**
...so your first step is to make choosing
which one to use as natural as breathing!

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
G-gotcha!

**Sieg:**
You're mine!

**Sigurd:**
You're still overly reliant on Lord
Siegfried's sheer strength.

**Sigurd:**
I can understand why you'd be in a hurry to end the fight, since you can only transform for a moment&ndash;

**Sigurd:**
But there's no need to rush. You still have plenty
of breathing room to use that technique.

**Sieg:**
R-right!

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Hraaaaaah!

**Sigurd:**
Hmm.

**Sigurd:**
You're not hesitating, but that's made your attack patterns too simplistic.

**Sigurd:**
An effective combat strategy relies on a mixture of both truth and lies. I want you to come up with at least three options for attacking your opponent at any given time.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Y-yikes! That sounds way too complicated for me!

**Sigurd:**
If it helps, you could try thinking of
these options as conditional reflexes.

**Sigurd:**
Perhaps you could try assigning numbers to each move. For example, four, seven, two, five...

**Sigurd:**
...could be something like that.
Easy, right?

**Both:**
...

**Sieg:**
I think we still have a long way to go before
I can start thinking like that...

**Sigurd:**
Oh? Hmm... Well, there's nothing wrong with associating them with something else, either.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Yeah? In that case, do ya think I could try
to think of 'em as paintins', Sigurd?

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
I'm just startin' ta get the faintest
picture of how it could work here...

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
But I'm definitely way more familiar with paintins' than I am numbers.

**Sieg:**
In that case, I'll try thinking of
my techniques as Servant classes.

**Sigurd:**
That sounds fine to me.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
All right, Sieggy, whaddaya say we do this thing!?
I'll go first!

**Sieg:**
“Sieggy”?

**Sieg:**
Well, all right. But I'll be going right after you!
Come on, let's do it!

**Sigurd:**
That's it! Show me what you've got!

**--BATTLE--**

**Both:**
(Huff, huff, huff...)

**Sigurd:**
There you go. Not bad at all.

**Sigurd:**
If you continue training regularly, it will only
be a matter of time until you master the sword.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Woohooo! We're finally done!

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Aw damn, I'm all outta juice.
Don't think I can take another step.

**Sieg:**
I'd offer to carry you, but I'm afraid
I've hit my limit, too... I'm sorry.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Those are the happiest exhausted faces I've ever seen...


---

**Sigurd:**
All right, I suppose I'll just have
to carry you both myself then.

**Sigurd:**
You know...that was a lot of fun.

**Sigurd:**
...Hmm. That's not good.

**Sigurd:**
I shouldn't be thinking about having fun.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why not? There's nothing wrong with enjoying yourself.


---

**Sigurd:**
...Do you really think so?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you don't believe me,why don't you ask the person you trust more than anyone?


---

**Sigurd:**
...Hmm.

**Narration:**
Heroes are defined by fighting.
By protecting the weak. By never smiling.

**Narration:**
That's why smiling would only weaken me.

**Narration:**
...At least, that's what I thought.

**Brynhild:**
I see. So that's what happened.

**Sigurd:**
What do you think of my weakness, my beloved?

**Brynhild:**
...

**Brynhild:**
Oh, my dear Sigurd. You haven't grown weak at all.
You're still as heroic as you ever were.

**Brynhild:**
Just as you once learned how to smile kindly
around me many years ago...

**Brynhild:**
...you've now learned how to smile around many people.

**Brynhild:**
That's not a sign of weakness.

**Brynhild:**
It's a sign that you've become more human&ndash;
more like the person you were meant to be.

**Brynhild:**
And I think it's wonderful.

**Sigurd:**
I see...

**Sigurd:**
Then I owe it all to you, my beloved Brynhild.

**Sigurd:**
If it had not been for the passion you inspired in me in life, or the loss I once grieved...

**Sigurd:**
...I would surely not be standing here before you now.

**Brynhild:**
Hehe. You never fail to make my heart beat faster.

**Brynhild:**
But that's just what I love about you...
Honey.

**Sigurd:**
Urk.
That, uh...certainly took me by surprise.

**Brynhild:**
You're always throwing me for a loop, so it's only fair that I return the favor now and then.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Oooi! Oh, wait, that's my name.
Hey, Siguuurd! We wanna train some more!

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
I just came up with a killer ultimate move,
an' I was hopin' you'd let me try it out on...Aah!

**Sieg:**
I'm so sorry.
We didn't mean to interrupt your alone time.

**Sieg:**
See, Oei?
I told you we should've waited until morning.

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
W-w-well how was I s'posed ta know what ya meant!?

**Katsushika Hokusai:**
S-s-sorry for botherin' ya, Sigurd.
I'll come back tomorrow!

**Sigurd:**
Don't be silly, Hokusai. This is a new ultimate move we're talking about, right?

**Sigurd:**
I'd love to see what you came up with.

**Sigurd:**
Beloved, would you mind lending them a hand?

**Brynhild:**
Of course not, Sigurd.

**Sieg:**
Actually, um... Would you mind if one more person
joined us? He's been telling us, quote:

**Sieg:**
“I still have nooo idea why little old
me became a Saber in the first place!”

**Sieg:**
...So I decided to bring him along, too.

**Astolfo:**
Evening! Sorry to spoil your date!
But I can't wait to have fun training with you!

**Sigurd:**
Heh... Of course you're welcome to train with us.

**Sigurd:**
But whether you have fun or not is up to you.

**Sigurd:**
My swordsmanship class is ninety-nine-percent
uncompromising, one-percent kind understanding.

**Astolfo:**
Y-y-y-yikes! I-I'll do my best to keep up!

**Narration:**
My inner feelings may no longer
be like a fiercely burning fire.

**Narration:**
They may now be more merciful,
like the gentle rays of spring sunshine.

**Narration:**
But, even so...

**Narration:**
...I can still sense it clearly, Sigurd the hero.

**Sigurd:**
...Yes. Of course I do.

**Narration:**
This power stored within me...

**Narration:**
...can reach explosive new heights thanks to its entanglements&ndash;its relationships&ndash;with those around me.

**Brynhild:**
We're waiting for you, Sigurd.

**Sigurd:**
...Right.
Then I suppose we'd better get started.

**Narration:**
I start by taking a single step forward,
as I answer their call.

**Narration:**
Formless and weightless though it may be, there is still energy to be found there&ndash;a kind with a name all its own.

**Narration:**
We call it...“love.”
