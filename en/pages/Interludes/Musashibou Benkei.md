# Musashibou Benkei

<h2>Destroyer Monk</h2>

**Benkei**
Ah, Master.
A moment of your time, please...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's up?
 


---
 
**Benkei**
Yes. The truth is that being on standby is not agreeable to me.

 
**Benkei**
I've been seeking a good place to train in&ndash;

 
**Mash**
Training, you say?
How about the mock combat curriculum?

 
**Mash**
There, now it'll summon mock-Servants for training.

 
**Mash**
They're similar to Shadow Servants, but extremely safe.

 
**Dr. Roman**
They're like projections made by a Summoning Circle.
Okay, I'll have some summoned for you now.

 
**Benkei**
Right, bring it on!


**--BATTLE--**

**Benkei**
Hm, that was a good fight for a training battle.

 
**Mash**
...Strange.
It was never that strong before...

 
**Benkei**
Now, to my next request.
Obviously, an opponent who won't hold back.

 
**Mash**
Yes, the next one.
Doctor, if you please.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hmm, I didn't set it up to be that strong
...How about this one?

 
**Mash**
Doctor?

 
**Shadow Servant**
Gi, gigi...Body, body, body!!

 
**Mash**
Wh-What is this&ndash;!?

 
**Benkei**
Ah, so the next one understands words, does it?
If it can think, then let's step up the battle!

 
**Benkei**
May peace be with you.
Now, bring it on!


**--BATTLE--**

**Benkei**
Yes, now we end it!

 
**Benkei**
Whew.
I really worked up a good sweat...

 
**Mash**
Doctor?
Doctor?

 
**Mash**
...Hmm, I can't contact him.

 
**Benkei**
It's a bit unsatisfying, shall we finish this?

 
**Mash**
That would seem wise.
Let's prepare to Rayshift back.

 
**Mash**
...Huh?
This reading is...

 
**Shadow Servant**
Heh, heh, heh, heh...
Give me...your...name!

 
**Mash**
Ugh...These training spirit bodies are growing far faster than we anticipated!

 
**Mash**
They're now the same as Shadow Servants...
No, they're starting to be on par with a Servant!

 
**Benkei**
&ndash;Oh? A Servant, eh?
Then it's only reasonable that we fight!

 
**Mash**
What!
We need to retreat!

 
**Benkei**
Leave no evil behind, Mash!
So that they do not grow into a greater threat later!

 
**Benkei**
One thing is certain, we must clean this up as much as we can!
At the very least, my weapon is telling me to do it!

 
**Mash**
...Understood! Master, once again.
Your orders please.

 
**Benkei**
&ndash;Come now, I am Musashibou Benkei, retainer of Ushiwakamaru. Taste this blade as a parting gift to hell!


**--BATTLE--**

**Benkei**
Hahahahaha!
Wonderful! Wonderful!

 
**Shadow Servant**
Y-You, too, are, only, a, fake...!!

 
**Benkei**
...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hey, what happened? Hey!
I said hey!

 
**Mash**
...Whew.
I got through to the Doctor.

 
**Mash**
Let's go back now.

 
**Benkei**
Yes. We've trained enough.
...Thank you, Master.

 
**Benkei**
Henceforth, I shall continue to be at your service.
