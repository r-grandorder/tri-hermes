# Cú Chulainn - Prototype

<h2>To the Nameless Battlefield</h2>

**Proto Cú**
&ndash;Hi.

 
**Proto Cú**
Rise and shine.
Say, how was your sleep?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, where's Mash?
 


---
 
**Proto Cú**
Let's see, this is a place in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, the Missy isn't here.

 
**Proto Cú**
Just you and me.
My bad, for forcing you into this.

 
**Proto Cú**
The Doctor's voice doesn't reach here.
That little creature isn't here, either.

 
**Proto Cú**
Why?
Well, that's simple.

 
**Proto Cú**
This is&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In a dream?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
In my consciousness?
 


---
 
**Proto Cú**
You can call it a dream, or perhaps somewhere deeper than consciousness and unconsciousness?

 
**Proto Cú**
I'm not clear on the details, it occasionally happens to Servants and Masters.

 
**Proto Cú**
A shared dream.
Put it simply, we can see each other's memories&ndash;

 
**Proto Cú**
That's why we can both exist here like this, even though it's "my dream."

 
**Proto Cú**
That's right. This is my dream.
My memories. My battlefield.

 
**Proto Cú**
It looks like the one you saw before?
Yeah, I suppose it does from your point of view.

 
**Proto Cú**
It's linked to the most similar sight you've seen recently, I think.

 
**Proto Cú**
Look, here they come.
To me, they look like the armies of Connacht&ndash;

 
**Proto Cú**
But who knows what they look like to you.
Hey, snap out of it, it's gonna be a fight.

 
**Proto Cú**
Try to keep up with your commands!
If you can summon other Heroic Spirits, then do it!

 
**Proto Cú**
&ndash;Let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Proto Cú**
Hahaha!
Yes, that's the way!

 
**Proto Cú**
Mow down that horde of enemies! Stab them,
slash them, hack them, there's no end to them!

 
**Proto Cú**
Just like the incoming waves.
An endless battle on an endless battlefield!

 
**Proto Cú**
Sure brought up some nice memories, didn't it?
Hahaha!

 
**Proto Cú**
Come on, Master! If we lose, we die.
Well, not that I'm sure about that&ndash;

 
**Proto Cú**
But fight like it is!
Now then, more are coming!


**--BATTLE--**

**Proto Cú**
...I guess this is it?

 
**Proto Cú**
Just as I'm getting into it, it's over.
Hardly worth the effort.

 
**Proto Cú**
How about you?
Still ready for more?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm a little tired.
 
**Proto Cú**
Haha!
You're honest!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can keep going.
 
**Proto Cú**
Sure you're not overdoing it?
Well, not that I can help you.

 


---
 
**Proto Cú**
Oh&ndash;

 
**Proto Cú**
Well well, this is a good dream!
So saving the best one for last, huh?

 
**Proto Cú**
Besides, talk about being unfair. That one over there is using "the spear of the real me" from the start.

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
That's unfortunate.
Why are you fighting with a hastily-made spear?

 
**Proto Cú**
I got my reasons.
I guess it reminds me of my last summon.

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
The answer's obvious, but I'll ask anyway.
You want me to go easy on you?

 
**Proto Cú**
You've got to be kidding.

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
Ah, just as I'd hoped.
Impressive, Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster.

 
**Proto Cú**
What are you talking about?
Well, Mr. "Cú Chulainn" of Ulster?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Two Cú Chulainn?
 


---
 
**Proto Cú**
Well, I guess it's possible. Meeting yourself in a dream. You get that, don't you?

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
Nice, that's really a good way to put it.
Well, shall we do this&ndash;

 
**Proto Cú**
Sure!
Let's go, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Proto Cú**
...So it's a draw.

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
With our Noble Phantasms, it's a miracle we didn't both bite the dust.

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
I'm impressed.
My younger self is quite a tough guy.

 
**Proto Cú**
My older self isn't too bad either.
I'll finish you off next time.

 
**Cú Chulainn?**
What?
That's my line.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So uh, what's going on?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean?
 


---
 
**Proto Cú**
Uh...
Well, basically, you see.

 
**Proto Cú**
My skills have improved within the dream.
When you wake up, I'm sure it will be of use.

 
**Proto Cú**
See you, Master.
Thanks for the company&ndash;
