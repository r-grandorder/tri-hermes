# Fionn mac Cumhaill

<h2>Fionn mac Cumhaill, The Hero who Defeated the Gods</h2>

**Fionn**
What&ndash;
I'm not so special a man.

 
**Fionn**
Indeed, I'm a man that would be categorized as a great hero. But that's just the end result.

 
**Fionn**
I killed a raging demonic beast, and slaughtered a creature from the underworld you could call death itself.

 
**Fionn**
But, all that is expected of a guardian of Erin, a warrior serving the High King.

 
**Fionn**
The deed would have been done without me.
For we are the glorious Knights of Fianna!

 
**Fou**
Fou, fou.

 
**Mash**
Yes, Fou.
...It sounds pretty heroic to me.

 
**Mash**
But you're being modest.
Fionn mac Cumhaill of Fianna, guardian of Erin.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Huh? Modest? That's modesty?
All it sounds like to me is bragging...

 
**Fionn**
Haha, surely you jest.
I'm just a man. I've nothing to brag about to anyone&ndash;

 
**Fionn**
Am I sure? Well, I'm sure I'm the hero who managed to slay a fallen Divine Spirit.

 
**Fionn**
I'm the descendant of the war god Nuadha, and the central figure in the Erin myth? But see, that's merely the end result.

 
**Fionn**
I'm simply a man. Yes&ndash;just a handsome man whose face is slightly more beautiful.

**Fujimaru 1:**
You called yourself a handsome man!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What self-confidence.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
Ugh, so bright! It's like a flood of self-confidence and bragging, isn't it!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Why does it hit me so hard... So this is Fionn mac Cumhaill, the most fulfilled man in all of Erin!

 
**Mash**
Protector of peace who has beaten many monsters&ndash;
He's fit to be called a hero, a great hero.

 
**Mash**
But, well, Master.
Well...

 
**Mash**
Fionn had his fair share of problems...
Calamities...or more like troubles...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Has he?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think I've heard something.
 


---
 
**Mash**
...Yes. You might say he had “lady troubles.”

 
**Mash**
Fionn may not be personally responsible, but if what I heard about the Knights of Fianna's downfall is true...

 
**Mash**
it was partly due to his actions.
At the very least, that's how the knights portray it.

 
**Mash**
By not saving the life of his reconciled subordinate, Diarmuid, he lost his charisma, and the order collapsed&ndash;

 
**Fionn**
Hm? What do you speak of, Mash?
Having second thoughts about marrying me?

 
**Mash**
N-No, not at all!
I'd never marry you!

 
**Fionn**
Oh? Is that so?
Hahaha, “never” is so harsh!

 
**Mash**
(Senpai, keep this between us, okay?)

 
**Mash**
(Fionn knows about the Order's collapse in his memories, but...he doesn't feel like part of it.)

 
**Mash**
(Like when we met Alexander before. Not the King of Conquerors of his later years, but the boy.)

 
**Mash**
(I think this is similar. He's been summoned in his young form. That's why&ndash;)

 
**Dr. Roman**
(I see. So, he's aware of his later failures,
but feels like they happened to someone else, right?)

 
**Mash**
(Yes, Doctor.)

 
**Fionn**
What are you whispering about...
Oh, I see. Rumors about me? Is that it?

 
**Fionn**
No need to bite my thumbs.
I already know. Mash&ndash;

 
**Fionn**
&ndash;You've fallen in love with me. Sorry about that.

 
**Mash**
!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
!?
(Even though she said she'd never, like, 5 seconds ago!?)

 
**Fou**
Fo, fou!?

 
**Fionn**
I am aware of it.
Of how I'm almost way too beautiful.

 
**Fionn**
This face, this physique.
It must almost be cruel to you girls...

 
**Fionn**
Thus my fate, namely&ndash; My lady troubles!
My never-ending assault of lady troubles!

 
**Fionn**
Yes, I need only stand still, and noble ladies will propose to me. I even once received a twin love confession from a lovely pair of witch sisters.

 
**Dr. Roman**
T-Twin confession!
Do things like that actually happen in real life!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'm beyond envious... I don't know about you as a person, but you shine so brightly as a man, Fionn mac Cumhaill...

 
**Fou**
Fou!?

 
**Fionn**
My most beloved person, treasure of Erin...
My first wife, to be specific...

 
Yes. How she and I loved each other...
It was so instant and eternal...

 
**Fionn**
That it made an evil fairy start stalking me like an idiot! Oh, this is all part of my destiny of endless lady troubles!

 
**Fionn**
Oh, however, I don't want to put the blame on you ladies.

 
**Fionn**
It's fate, and so nothing can be done.
Overflowing beauty can drive a woman mad, at times.

 
**Fionn**
I'm just...too beautiful...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dazzling, too dazzling...
 
**Mash**
Y-Yes... Certainly...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um, are we done here?
 
**Mash**
Senpai, I don't think he can hear you&ndash;

 


---
 
**Mash**
...Fionn seems to think the source of all his troubles is always from elsewhere.

 
**Mash**
He's right, in a sense...
But that's... No.

 
**Fou**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Mash**
Right, Fou. Just a bit...
He doesn't seem fully satisfied...

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'm terribly dissatisfied!
Why do popular guys get even more popular?

 
**Dr. Roman**
W-Well, never mind. Anyway, why did we come here all the way to the 1st century?

 
**Dr. Roman**
To the Ancient Roman era that's under correction,
and heading out specifically to Gaul&ndash;

 
**Fionn**
I don't have actual business in Gaul.
I sensed danger in Erin and my feet led me here.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Erin... Ireland?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, I see. You didn't come to Gaul.
You're trying to get closer to Ireland.

 
**Fionn**
Right, and I guess I was on the spot.

 
**Fionn**
They seem to have sensed our approach, and they're coming out to greet us.

 
**???**
Guuuu!

 
**Mash**
Detecting hostile presences!
Senpai, here they come... Combat instruction, please!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Charge them head-on!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Calm down!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Dr. Roman**
Confirmed defeat of the first wave!
But the next one will be inbound soon!

 
**Mash**
This isn't the first giant “hand” we've seen&ndash;
but something seems strange, Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They seemed to be leading beastmen?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're after Fionn?
 


---
 
**Fionn**
Ah, this sensation really brings back memories... Of the time when I was a mere traveler, and not the leader of the Order.

 
**Fionn**
I&ndash;

 
**Fionn**
I!
I faced evil as a lone warrior!

 
**Fionn**
Against those who cruelly murdered innocents!
Yes, I... I know about you!

 
**Fionn**
&ndash;Come and get me!

 
**Mash**
M-More are coming!?

 
**???**
Guuuu!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Here comes the second wave! No... They've revived!?
And there are more of them! Be careful!


**--BATTLE--**

**Fionn**
...Hm. So I guess that's all of them.

 
**Fionn**
You made it through the fight unharmed.
The disturbance I felt is now gone.

 
**Mash**
That giant hand...
Was that the danger you sensed?

 
**Fionn**
Oh, yeah. Well, I guess it turned out to be that.

 
**Mash**
That was an unknown enemy we've met multiple times. We have no accurate data on it&ndash;

 
**Mash**
But you talked as if you knew something about it.
Is it possible...you have some idea?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'd like to hear it, too. Yeah... You definitely sounded like you know something!

 
**Fionn**
...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wait, he's ignoring me? He's ignoring what I say?

 
**Mash**
Please, Fionn. If you know anything, please don't hide it...

 
**Fionn**
...How can I keep my mouth shut when such a lovely lady looks at me with such passion.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Right, so...that's how it is...
He really is ignoring me...

 
**Fou**
Fou, foou...

 
**Fionn**
That said, this is just a hunch.
I don't have enough evidence right now.

 
**Fionn**
As captain of the glorious Knights of Fianna, I can't afford to make an unsightly mistake in front of a lady.

 
**Fionn**
So, could you give me some time?
When I have solid proof, I'll most definitely tell you.

 
**Mash**
...Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't be helped.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Looks like we have to wait.
 


---
 
**Mash**
...I see.
I understand, Fionn.

 
**Fionn**
Now, with the power of my Noble Phantasm of wisdom,
“Fintan Finegas”&ndash;

 
**Fionn**
we'd solve any riddle instantly,
but that would be boring, wouldn't it?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Boring!?
If it'll tell us everything, then use it, please?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Like making a prediction about the King of Mages' next move! There are other things I'd like to know as well so... Please?

 
**Fionn**
Hah hah hah. I'd say he probably set up some countermeasures so it can't be easily predicted. Same goes for that giant hand.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Ugh... Fine, b-but what's with the name of your Noble Phantasm!

 
**Fionn**
Anyways, Mash.
May I ask something?

 
**Mash**
Sure. What is it?

 
**Fionn**
I did ask you to wait, but there are things that we can talk about without waiting.

 
**Fionn**
So, let's go to My Room and discuss in detail. You're curious about me, too, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You said “about me” just now?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That room isn't yours, is it?
 


---
 
**Fionn**
...Right. Okay, Fujimaru can come, too. That's fine by me!

 
**Mash**
W-Wait!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Man, he's full of energy.
Still, I'd like to learn a thing or two from him, too...

 
**Fou**
Fouuuuu!
