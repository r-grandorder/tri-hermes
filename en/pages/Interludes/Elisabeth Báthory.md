<h2>The New Elisa</h2>

**Mash**
Excuse me. An old-fashioned letter arrived addressed to you, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh, read it to me?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A letter...arrived here?
 


---
 
**Mash**
Read it to you? All right...Hm.
It's a notice for a concert tour.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Concert...Whose?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh...Right, ignore it.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
What! Who? Who's coming here?
Magi☆Mari! Could it be Magi☆Mari?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, has my holy 2D internet idol finally manifested here in the real world?

 
**Fou**
Fou...

 
**Mash**
Let's see, it says the idol is...
the super hot Dragon Girl, Idoler☆Elisa...

 
**Dr. Roman**
We're done.
Everyone, great work.

 
**Mash**
Huh?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Who cares? Honestly, who cares about a real idol and their scandals?

 
**Dr. Roman**
It'll muddy my boyish heart!
Those virtual net idols won't ever betray me.

 
**Elisabeth**
Here you are, [♂ Puppy /♀️ Deerlet}!
Did you read my announcement yet? Did you?

 
**Elisabeth**
Of course you did! What an easy response!
And a healthy complexion! Perfect!

 
**Elisabeth**
All right, then let's go do it!!
Idoler☆Elisa, Live Tour 2017 
 
**Elisabeth**
I heard people were already lining up the night before,
so you better hurry♪ Here we go, Chief AD/Sponsor!

 
**Elisabeth**
Elly Festival IN some time somewhere.
Let the Rondo of Blood begin!

 
**Mash**
Ah, Senpai!
What does she mean by sponsor?

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Fou**
...Fou 
 
**Elisabeth**
Impossible...Impossible! The venue is supposed to be filled with mobs of pathetic slaves!

 
**Elisabeth**
With wildly waving glow-sticks, and fresh blood! It was supposed to be a special live event with tragedy and genocide!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, about that...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I am running out of funds!
 


---
 
**Fou**
Fou?

 
**Elisabeth**
Huh?
Is it possible the fans got the wrong start time?

 
**Elisabeth**
Are they going to surprise me because today's my birthday? Are they?

 
**Elisabeth**
Well, since it's not actually my birthday today, we could make it an anniversary, right?

 
**Elisabeth**
Um, today marks the successful opening of my live tour.
...(Jotting that down)

 
**Elisabeth**
That should do it.
Okay, [♂ Puppy /♀️ Deerlet}!!Elly Live Tour 2017!!
Let's get this party started!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, about that...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Elly, you've grown so much...
 


---
 
**Mash**
...No, Senpai, look!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's definitely an enemy raid.
Honestly, I'm grateful.

 
**Elisabeth**
Right! They definitely hate us!
I kind of noticed that, you dummy!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
There's more, Master!
A large number of enemy reinforcements!

 
**Mash**
It's like they'll do anything to stop her concert...
Firmly resolved to crush it, to protect their wives and children...

 
**Mash**
I am sensing the determination of a man, filling with grim resolve!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Well, I'd guess that Elisabeth giving a concert near the town would leave the townsfolk numb for a day.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wow, things are heating up!
In a sense, today's concert is a jam-packed success!

 
**Fou**
Fou!!

 
**Elisabeth**
Not that I like the way things are heating up!

 
**Elisabeth**
After all, if you're swooning over my stellar singing, doesn't that make this a huge win for me?

 
**Mash**
It's that positive thinking that's at fault here.
Singing shouldn't knock people out, Elisabeth!


**--BATTLE--**

**Dr. Roman**
They were casually mixed with others besides humans... Did the forest beasts also sense danger?

 
**Elisabeth**
...I won. I won, but,
in winning the battle, I lost the concert...

 
**Elisabeth**
Oh, if I can't be an idol, then I'll have to go back to being an ordinary Dragon Girl...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, about that...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Dragon Girls are pretty new.
 


---
 
**Elisabeth**
I suppose I belong in a dark dungeon, an imprisoned idol, unnoticed and ignored.

 
**Elisabeth**
Doomed to silently rot away...
Oh...Who made this era the way it is?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Lev Lainur, I suppose.

 
**Fou**
Fooou!

 
**Mash**
U-Um, Elisabeth, don't get disappointed...

 
**Elisabeth**
Spare me your sympathy...
I... I just noticed...

 
**Elisabeth**
&ndash;You're on the right track, aren't you?

 
**Mash**
Excuse me?
Right...track?

 
**Elisabeth**
Your character is [♂ Puppy /♀️ Deerlet}-like, so modest and genuine.
You know...You might just work!

 
**Mash**
Modest...Am I really?

 
**Elisabeth**
Listen, are you interested in becoming an idol?
You are, right? Of course you are! You'll do it!

 
**Elisabeth**
Yes, this is it! An idol duo!
All for me and one for me!

 
**Elisabeth**
So, what do we call our unit? [♂ Puppy /♀️ Deerlet}!
You have a good idea?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, Elly☆Mash, maybe...
 
**Dr. Roman**
You just ripped off Magi☆Mari, didn't you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How about Dra♪Fresh Blood Shield Girl!
 
**Fou**
Fou...

 


---
 
**Elisabeth**
That's kind of lame and I just don't feel it...
Hm, since we're a lance and a shield, then...

 
**Elisabeth**
Contradiction! That's it! We're full of contradictions! Contradiction☆Drastic!

 
**Fou**
Fou, fou 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-I'm not sure...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You know the word contradiction.
 


---
 
**Elisabeth**
Well, let's get started with our lessons! Let's go, Mash!
We'll shine in the night sky together!

 
**Elisabeth**
Let's aim to be Idol☆Servant stars!

 
**Mash**
S-Senpai, please, do something...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, right. Good luck...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do my best to back you up as a sponsor!
 


---
 
**Mash**
?!?!
