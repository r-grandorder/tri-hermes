# Atalante

<h2>Smile of the Goddess</h2>

**Atalante:**
Master, I need to talk to you.

 
**Atalante:**
You see, I want to go out to sea.
There's something that I left on that Island.

 
**Atalante:**
If it's no problem, I'd like to leave now&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
We're lucky we have a ship, but what did you leave behind?

 
**Atalante:**
Oh, a statue of Artemis&ndash;the Lunar goddess.

 
**Atalante:**
I made it by hand, but I couldn't take it with me during the battle.

 
**Mash:**
I see.

 
**Atalante:**
We were born from the gods, and they give us power.
We must never fail to be grateful.

 
**Atalante:**
...Well, despite their great power, some of them can be a little strange.

 
**Atalante:**
It's their charm point, and their weakness.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, you've had a rough time because of it&ndash;

 
**Atalante:**
There should be a cave on the other side of this forest.
Let's go.

 
**Atalante:**
...The stench of animals. Mash, ready your weapon&ndash;
and prepare for combat.

 
**Mash:**
Right!

 
**Mash:**
This is&ndash;a chimera!

 
**Atalante:**
A demonic beast left behind in this world...
Its luck ran out when it met a hunter, though.

 
**Atalante:**
I will make good use of its meat and pelt.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Atalante:**
What a headache...
Let's keep going.

 
**Mash:**
Are we almost at the cave?

 
**Atalante:**
Yeah...Okay, this is the entrance.
Let's go.

 
**Atalante:**
...Hey, Master, do you have any wishes for the Grail?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not really.
 
**Atalante:**
Hmm.
I see...

 
**Atalante:**
Well, given the state of the world that makes sense, I guess.

 
**Atalante:**
But the Grail's power is omnipotent.
Perhaps you should come up with a wish.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To restore the world.
 
**Atalante:**
...Hmph. That's exactly the right wish.
But it's also the wrong answer.

 
**Atalante:**
When you get the Grail, that wish should come true on its own.

 
**Atalante:**
A greedy answer isn't necessarily the wrong one.
Keep that in mind.

 


---
 
**Atalante:**
...To tell the truth, I have a wish of my own.
It's a simple wish, and I know it will never come true&ndash;

 
**Atalante:**
But I still can't give up on it.
That's why I pray to the gods.

 
**Atalante:**
I protect my vows to the gods.
...Or so I thought...

 
**Mash:**
Atalante is looking off into the distance...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, that goddess was pretty...
impactful.

 
**Atalante:**
...Enough talking, I suppose.
It's time for combat.

 
**Atalante:**
Master, stay back.
...Let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Atalante:**
We should be almost there...
Oh, good. This is it.

 
**Mash:**
That's the statue of the goddess?

 
**Atalante:**
Yes, it's handmade.
Impressive, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you just add Orion there.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Needs more Orion.
 


---
 
**Atalante:**
Y-You want me to make one of him? Hmm...
He's the type of person I hate most.

 
**Atalante:**
He's lazy, lustful, and never learns. He's only interested in having fun, and doesn't care for others.

 
**Atalante:**
...He did look like he was having fun, but that fun is far too different for my tastes.

 
**Atalante:**
Not my type of man at all. If I had to pick between him and Jason, I don't know what I'd do.

 
**Mash:**
I-It's that bad?

 
**Atalante:**
Let me ask you, Mash. If Jason and Orion were the last two men in the world, who would you marry?

 
**Mash:**
Huh? I'd um...
Well...

 
**Atalante:**
See what I mean...huh?

 
**???:**
Hehehe, that's not a nice way to talk about someone's boyfriend, is it...Atalante?

 
**Atalante:**
...Hyah!

 
**Mash:**
T-That voice!

 
**Artemis:**
Hey guys!

 
**Orion:**
Hello, I know this is a surprise but I am back...
Speaking of which, Mash are you busy later?

 
**Artemis:**
Hehehehe. Even if it's the truth,
denying it is proof of my love!

 
**Artemis:**
So let's do this!
If I win you'll never get my blessing again.

 
**Artemis:**
I don't know about my Brother, though!

 
**Atalante:**
That's crazy!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Artemis:**
Ugh, I lost.
I guess my love still isn't strong enough!

 
**Orion:**
Huh? You've got more love? Seriously?
What you've got is already crushing me...

 
**Artemis:**
Well, if I lost, I lost.
You may retain my blessing!

 
**Atalante:**
Thank you Goddess, I will continue to treasure this statue.

 
**Artemis:**
Okay Orion, let's go back!

 
**Orion:**
Mash, at least hold me tight against your chest...
BRWRAH!

 
**Atalante:**
Well. That was an unexpected interruption,
but we made it through...

 
**Atalante:**
Thank you, Master.
I owe you.

 
**Atalante:**
Now let us return.
Want to take that chimera meat with us?

 
**Atalante:**
You must be sick of rations.
No? I see...

 
**Atalante:**
Then this boar pelt... No, huh?
Hmph. This is difficult.


<h2>London Child</h2>

**Atalante:**
I'm sorry, Master.
May I have a word?

 
**Atalante:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You look depressed.
 


---
 
**Atalante:**
...I want to go to this London place you visited. Will you help?

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;We're here, but why are we here?

 
**Atalante:**
I heard there was a child Servant.

 
**Mash:**
Jack the Ripper.
Yes, she WAS a child... I think.

 
**Mash:**
To think that's who she really was... What a shock.

 
**Atalante:**
That's not exactly right. She's simply one aspect of Jack the Ripper.

 
**Atalante:**
Jack the Ripper is a black box, filled with the beliefs, hypotheses, and ideas of people everywhere.

 
**Atalante:**
Even without knowing the real killer, as long as you know the name you can summon the appropriate Servant.

 
**Atalante:**
...In that sense, she's similar to Hassan-i Sabbah.

 
**Atalante:**
In a normal Holy Grail War, one of almost 20 of them can be summoned via the concept of “Assassin”

 
**Mash:**
You sure know a lot.
I am surprised.

 
**Atalante:**
I've crossed paths with them.
I hope that child disappears completely...

 
**Mash:**
Huh? She should've disappeared already&ndash;

 
**???:**
&ndash;Hehehehe.

 
**Mash:**
!?!?!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's weak, but I'm picking up a reading around you! Be careful!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
What...was that?

 
**Atalante:**
Remnants of a Servant.
Best to destroy them.

 
**Jack:**
Hehe, hehehe, heheheheh.

 
**Atalante:**
There's more!

 
**Mash:**
This feeling... It's her!
Fall back, Master!

 
**Atalante:**
&ndash;Rest in peace, Jack!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...The reading in this area is gone. Doctor, are you picking up more?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hold on, I'm expanding the search radius.
...Ah! Yes, I've found something similar...

 
**Atalante:**
Let's head there, then.
Master, Mash, follow me!

 
**Atalante:**
For a Servant, past Holy Grail Wars are more like hazy dreams than distant memories.

 
**Atalante:**
No matter how strong a past bond might be, it will inevitably fade.

 
**Atalante:**
...Of course it will. Fighting a hundred Holy Grail Wars is like leading a hundred lives.

 
**Atalante:**
More than anything, it ceases to feel real.
You stop being able to cling to just one life.

 
**Atalante:**
It doesn't mean we're choosing a noble death.
We're simply abandoning a pallid life.

 
**Atalante:**
So we forget them&ndash;like they were the dreams we once had. But some things cannot be forgotten.

 
**Atalante:**
That battle, to me, was one of them.

 
**Jack:**
Hehehe! Hehehe!
Mommy! Mommy!

 
**Jack:**
&ndash;Mommy!

 
**Mash:**
This voice!

 
**Atalante:**
I thought you might not have completely disappeared... Jack the Ripper.

 
**Jack:**
Yup. I mean, this world is wavering.

 
**Jack:**
So even we, who should no longer be here, can look for her once more.

 
**Atalante:**
...Stop it, Jack.
You won't find your mother in this world.

 
**Atalante:**
Even if she did exist, she wouldn't accept you as her daughter.

 
**Jack:**
Shut up!
You don't know anything about us!

 
**Atalante:**
You're wrong. I do know you... However...

 
**Atalante:**
I don't understand you. I can't understand you. You don't want to be understood.

 
**Atalante:**
You will try to fulfill your wish.
I will stop you. That is all.

 
**Jack:**
Okay, got it. Then&ndash;
it's time to die!

 
**Mash:**
...Here it comes!

 
**Atalante:**
Sorry, but I must finish you off.
I truly am sorry.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jack:**
Wah...wah...
That's so mean...so mean...

 
**Atalante:**
&ndash;You're right. I'm mean.
Still, I wanted to save you.

 
**Atalante:**
I really, really wanted to save you.
No matter how broken you were.

 
**Jack:**
...I see.
Hehe, you're weird, Mommy.

 
**Jack:**
We were...saved...already&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Whew... We beat her.

 
**Atalante:**
...No, we didn't.

 
**Atalante:**
As long as London exists, she'll keep coming back.

 
**Atalante:**
Until we restore history to its proper form.

 
**Mash:**
Huh?
But she&ndash;

 
**Atalante:**
Jack is special. When history is restored, she'll pass on as she should.

 
**Atalante:**
...That's what I want to believe.

 
**Atalante:**
Master, my wish is to save all the abused, unhappy children in this world.

 
**Atalante:**
What do you think?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's a good wish.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's a hard wish.
 


---
 
**Atalante:**
Thank you for not laughing.

 
**Atalante:**
It may be hard.
No, it may be close to impossible.

 
**Atalante:**
But still...
I can't give up on my wish.

 
**Atalante:**
Even if it becomes an eternal chain which binds me forever&ndash;

 
**Atalante:**
I will keep fighting.
Let's go, Master.

 
**Atalante:**
First, we have to save the world so that the children can live.
