# Ushiwakamaru

<h2>Love is Not Free</h2>

**Ushiwakamaru**
Yawn... Good morning Master!
What's wrong?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we?
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Now that you mention it... That is strange.
Did the Rayshift fail?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Where are Mash and Fou?

 
**Mash**
Over here.

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Mash, Fou!
I'm glad you're safe!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Are you hurt?
If something happened to you, Master would be sad.

 
**Fou**
Nnn, kyu.

 
**Mash**
I'm fine.

 
**Mash**
...It seems there was an accident during Rayshift.
Please wait while I ask the Doctor to bring us back.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Sorry everybody. I don't know what happened, but I have your signals here.

 
**Dr. Roman**
There's no data on where you jumped, but it's spatially stable.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Give me a minute.
Once the repairs are done, I'll bring you back.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Understood! Master, I'll go look and make sure there's no danger!

 
**Mash**
Actually, we should stick together.
Is that all right with you, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No problem.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do that.
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Okay!

 
**Mash**
Master, Ushiwakamaru, watch yourselves.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I-I'm fine... Hyaaah!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I-I'm sorry. Thank you! I was raised by the Kurama Tengu and I still slipped...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Still, this forest&ndash;
It seems different than the one in my country.

 
**Mash**
That's right. From the look of that coast...
Are we on a deserted island?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
You're probably right, Mash.
There's likely no land bridge.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
If we're trapped here, should we chop some wood and make a raft?

 
**Mash**
If we can Rayshift back, we probably won't need a raft.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Too bad.
I'm quite good at chopping wood&ndash;

 
**Mash**
What's wrong?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
&ndash;Be quiet.
I sense an evil presence.

 
**Mash**
...Me too.
Fou, be quiet.

 
**Fou**
Kyu.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...
S-Sorry.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Fou's so cute, I feel like my heart skipped a beat.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
The presence&ndash;is starting to approach.
Master, shall we launch a surprise attack?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do that.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Got it.
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Right, I'll go around the side.
Mash, you intercept them.

 
**Mash**
Wow... Her "Presence Concealment" is Assassin level.
Let's do this, Master stand back.

 
**Mash**
...Here they come!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I trapped them!
Let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Ushiwakamaru**
Whew! That was good exercise!
By the way, can we eat them?

 
**Mash**
Probably not a good idea to eat the Lamia...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
A shame. If you carefully drain them of blood, snakes can be quite delicious.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I used to eat them all the time during war.

 
**Mash**
I-I see...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
This island is pretty small, huh?
Doesn't look like there's much to see.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...A bit of a shame, really.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, hello? It's the Doctor. It's going to take me a little longer to adjust the Rayshift.

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's just refusing to stabilize...

 
**Mash**
Understood. ...I'm sorry.
Looks like it will take a bit more time.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Anyway Master, I want to hear a story about you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
About me?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why?
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Is it strange to want to know about one's Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm boring.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not interesting...
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
No, I want to learn about you, Master.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I might not be the best listener, but I'll try my hardest. So please, go ahead!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...I see, I see.
Thank you, Master!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...Looks like the Rayshift's not ready yet.
It's so quiet.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Master, um...
I have a question&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Am I useful to you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Obviously.
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I see. Glad to hear it. I...I'm used to people telling me they don't understand me.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
When I tell them I want to fight for someone else's sake, they all seem confused.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Is my reason that strange?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I fought for my brother's sake, but he never believed me, even until the end.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
It's true that there were misunderstandings, but I never thought of hurting him even once&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I'm not angry. It's just strange to me.
Why can't people understand how I feel?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I'm sorry. This isn't something I should be talking about with you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I want to hear more.
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...You're a lot like Ise Yoshimori, you know?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Oh, I don't mean that you look like him.
He had a face like a wicked fox.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
But he was easy to talk to.
About serious things, or just joking around.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
You have many Servants. But you take time to talk to them one-on-one&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
It's a little embarrassing, but I'm very grateful.

 
**Mash**
Is it ready? Doctor?
I think it's time for us to go back&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, sorry.
I have bad news.

 
**Mash**
...Go ahead with the bad news, Dr. Roman.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Just so we're clear, this isn't my fault, okay?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Until you can stabilize that area, even if you try to return, you'll just end up somewhere else.

 
**Dr. Roman**
The cause of the instability circles around the island. Any ideas?

 
**Mash**
Around the island?
Could it be&ndash;that ship?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I thought it might be a ship... Yeah.
I'm picking up magical energy coming from it.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Can you go there and remove the source of the instability?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I think so.
Let's jump aboard when it gets close.

 
**Mash**
A-At this distance?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Mash, I once jumped across eight ships.
This is nothing.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
...I think it's about time. Mash, once I'm aboard I'll bring the ship close.

 
**Mash**
Understood.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Just watch me. Master, take this&ndash;
"Dan-No-Ura Eight-Boat Leap!"&ndash;Here I go!

 
**Mash**
S-She jumped!
She jumped over eight boats in length!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I did it! Okay guys, sorry!
But I'm taking this boat to shore!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I promise I won't kill you&ndash;

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I won't kill you&ndash;
Oh, no! They're already dead!

 
**Mash**
U-Um, Ushiwakamaru seems to be having a hard time!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's wait and believe.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She'll be fine.
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I'm getting this boat to shore&ndash;
Tch, get out of my way!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Okay, got it! Mash!
I'm turning the boat around!

 
**Mash**
It's getting closer.
At this range I can do it too&ndash;!

 
**Mash**
Ushiwakamaru!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Oh, Mash!
Sorry, it took me a while!

 
**Mash**
I see. It was a ghost ship!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
U-Um, Mash?

 
**Mash**
Yes?

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Was Master disappointed?
It did take me a while...

 
**Mash**
...Don't worry.
Master believed in you.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
I see!
Okay, then nothing can stop me!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Come, you ghastly creatures!
My name is Minamoto&ndash;No, Ushiwakamaru!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
As a Servant of Fujimaru,
I shall defeat you!


**--BATTLE--**

**Ushiwakamaru**
Yup, that's most of them.
Master! Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Wave to her.)
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good job!
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Mash!
Master praised me!

 
**Mash**
I'm so happy for you, Ushiwakamaru!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Right!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hey guys, the readings from that ghost ship isn't totally gone.

 
**Dr. Roman**
If you don't hurry up, you won't be able to come home.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Huh? Really?
But&ndash;

 
**Mash**
I don't see anything else...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
A mist? Rising from the bodies?

 
**Mash**
I see, the vengeful spirit driving the ship was the source of the instability!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
&ndash;Okay Mash, this time let's finish it.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Evil is destined to fall.
Especially, wicked demons...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Your grudge shall be slain by me
&ndash;Ushiwakamaru!


**--BATTLE--**

**Ushiwakamaru**
I defeated them!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Okay, you all can come home now.
Let me know when you're ready.

 
**Mash**
Understood.
Let's meet with Master first.

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Master, I have slain the vengeful spirits!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
It's a shame you couldn't see me since we were fighting on the decks...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
But next time, I promise to fight somewhere you can see!

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
And um...well.
If you wouldn't mind...

 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Oh, no...
Never mind, I guess...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
D-Do you think you could maybe pat me on the head?
I'd really like that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure.
 


---
 
**Ushiwakamaru**
Thank you!
