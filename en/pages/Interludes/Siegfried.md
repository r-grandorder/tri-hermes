# Siegfried

## Dragon Slayer

**Siegfried**
Ah Master, Mash Kyrielight, I need a word with you...
Is now a good time?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't mind.

---
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not a problem.

---
 


 
**Mash**
No, I don't mind.

 
**Siegfried**
...I see.
Well, where to start...

 
**Siegfried**
You know how I am the "Dragon Slayer?"

 
**Mash**
Of course, you defeated the evil dragon Fafnir, didn't you?

 
**Siegfried**
Yes. Afterward I bathed in its blood&ndash;
and gained immortality from it.

 
**Siegfried**
Although, there is one part which was untouched by its blood. My back.

 
**Siegfried**
...Well, that I'm aware of, at least.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why wasn't it touched?

---
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why did you leave it?

---
 


 
**Siegfried**
Let's just say I had my reasons.
I'm terrible at explaining this.

 
**Siegfried**
You see, because I bathed in Fafnir's blood&ndash;
I can resonate with "that dragon."

 
**Siegfried**
You could say it's like the relationship between Masters and Servants.

 
**Siegfried**
However, the link is extremely weak. It only allows us to confirm each other's survival at best.

 
**Siegfried**
During the battle in France, I was certain that Fafnir was destroyed, but...

 
**Siegfried**
It seems it's revived.

 
**Mash**
Wha...Fafnir has?!

 
**Siegfried**
Master, I beg of you.
Return to France, and this time slay the dragon.

 
**Siegfried**
Won't you take me with you?

 
**Dr. Roman**
All right, I'll start monitoring...
Multiple signatures of lifeforms confirmed.

 
**Dr. Roman**
It goes without saying, they're not human.

 
**Mash**
Please look at this, Master!
There are wyverns among them!

 
**Siegfried**
Did they survive that battle then recover?
Or were they reborn?

 
**Siegfried**
...In any case, they must be destroyed.
Aim for the wyverns first. Let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Siegfried**
...It looks like we got them for now.
Let's look for Fafnir.

 
**Mash**
A ruined fortress.
It looks like the wyverns attacked it.

 
**Mash**
But Doctor, I thought Fafnir was summoned by that Jeanne.

 
**Mash**
It's possible she, too is&ndash;

 
**Siegfried**
...No, I doubt that.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Siegfried's correct.

 
**Dr. Roman**
She needed the Grail to exist as a Servant, there's no sign of it in France.

 
**Siegfried**
I'm sure.
...I fear this is my fault.

 
**Mash**
...Yours?

 
**Siegfried**
By defeating Fafnir, I left behind a legend and became a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Siegfried**
But, my very existence itself is also the proof that "Fafnir exists."

 
**Siegfried**
Not to mention it's already been summoned once here in France.

 
**Siegfried**
So long as Fafnir isn't killed completely, it will keep reviving.

 
**Mash**
But I thought its Master, Jeanne no longer exists...

 
**Siegfried**
Dragons generates magical energy simply by breathing.

 
**Dr. Roman**
&ndash;I see. Standing atop of all Phantasmals,
they never have to worry about magical energy.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Living. Just by doing that,
it's possible to generate magical energy!

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
Master, it's the wyverns!
They've formed a pack and started to attack!

 
**Siegfried**
It's not easy being a "Dragon Slayer."
Master, let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Siegfried**
&ndash;Hm.
These wyverns were just born.

 
**Mash**
Born?

 
**Siegfried**
When dragons become as large as Fafnir, they can bear offspring on their own.

 
**Siegfried**
Just like these.

 
**Siegfried**
Most of them are dead, but even if a few survive&ndash;
they'll eventually be surrounded by strong fantasies.

 
**Siegfried**
Then new Evil Dragons will be born.

 
**Siegfried**
It's because of that fear, we humans desperately fought the dragons.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Weren't you afraid?

---
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're brave.

---
 


 
**Siegfried**
I appreciate that, Master.
Unfortunately, I was afraid.

 
**Siegfried**
I only killed the dragon because I was asked to.
I suppose I'm the type who&ndash;just can't refuse a request.

 
**Siegfried**
To all warriors, the title Dragon Slayer was an eternal honor. ...I won't deny that I was motivated by fame.

 
**Siegfried**
But, it was so scary I regretted it immediately.

 
**Mash**
You still ended up victorious, right?

 
**Siegfried**
Yes, but as I said before, even I don't know how I won.

 
**Siegfried**
When I came to, there was the bloody dragon and my bloodstained self. Its lair was dyed red.

 
**Siegfried**
My skin which should have been badly burned was hardly hurt. ...It was strange, but I knew I had won.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Were you happy?

---
 
**Siegfried**
Of course. The dragon was slain and I thought I could devote my entire life to realizing that.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was it fun?

---
 
**Siegfried**
...Yes, it was fun.
The moment I realized it, I gave an uncharacteristic shout.

 


 
**Siegfried**
The treasure I gained eventually cast me into misfortune,
but... I have no regrets or hesitations.

 
**Siegfried**
I know it's not the most enlightened way to put it,
but I accepted the circumstances of my life.

 
**Siegfried**
I grant someone's wish.
I accept their joy, their sadness, and their rage.

 
**Siegfried**
...And that was enough to give my life fulfillment.
Except&ndash;

 
**Siegfried**
!!!
It seems our idle chatter is at an end.

 
**Siegfried**
I've located it&ndash;
Which means it's located me, as well.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I've picked up a massive signature incoming...
No doubt about it, it's Fafnir!

 
**Siegfried**
Now is the time to settle this!
Let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Siegfried**
...Farewell Fafnir.
May you be destroyed, this time.

 
**Mash**
This is Mash.
Fafnir's destruction confirmed.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yes, I've confirmed its destruction on my side as well.
I'm scanning, but there's no sign at all.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I think you managed to finish him off this time.

 
**Siegfried**
Now it seems Balmung too has regained its original power.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can you continue with your story?

---
 


 
**Siegfried**
...There's nothing more to tell.
We'll talk more next time we get the chance.

 
**Siegfried**
I'm grateful, let's return Master.


## In Search of Das Rheingold

**Siegfried**
Master, Mash Kyrielight.
Forgive me, but I have a request.

 
**Mash**
Is it Fafnir again&ndash;?

 
**Siegfried**
No, that dragon was completely destroyed.
Please rest assured.

 
**Siegfried**
But when the dragon revived, so did my lost Noble Phantasm. We must return to France and secure it&ndash;

 
**Mash**
We've arrived.

 
**Mash**
...It's just as Siegfried said.
I can sense a powerful presence.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I can confirm that, as well.
Hang on while I find the shortest route.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's the Noble Phantasm?

---
 


 
**Siegfried**
Have you never heard of the Rheingold?

 
**Dr. Roman**
The Rheingold
...The treasure you obtained.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I've heard it's a mountain of treasures that couldn't be exhausted even by all the people of the era.

 
**Siegfried**
That's an exaggeration.
But it's enough to allow me, my children&ndash;

 
**Siegfried**
and even my grandchildren to grow old in luxury and still have some left over.

 
**Siegfried**
It's likely an aftereffect of Fafnir's resurrection.
The Rheingold has been summoned, as well.

 
**Siegfried**
There's evil surrounding the gold.
If we don't secure it, there will be trouble.

 
**Mash**
Trouble how?

 
**Siegfried**
For example... Suppose a man finds it. With one glance, the treasure would captivate him completely.

 
**Siegfried**
The captivated man would naturally spend the treasure.
Once he did, he would become known as its owner.

 
**Siegfried**
Eventually, everything around him&ndash;will be drawn into a bloody struggle.
The battle will drag on and spread like fire, without end.

 
**Siegfried**
In the end, the nation will be consumed by atrocities and executions, treachery and perfidy.

 
**Siegfried**
That's what Rheingold is.
I regret having ever summoned it...

 
**Mash**
Understood. We need to prevent that from happening. Let's hurry to the location!

 
**Dr. Roman**
I've got the route.
Hurry!

 
**Siegfried**
...The gold has begun to attract evil creatures.
Let's break through, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Siegfried**
Hm...

 
**Soldier A**
That treasure...
belongs to me!

 
**Soldier B**
Quiet!
That's mine!

 
**Siegfried**
We're too late.
The mind corruption has already begun.

 
**Siegfried**
We can disable them for now.
Master, let's go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
Will they be all right?

 
**Siegfried**
Once the Rheingold disappears from this nation, any related memories will also be erased and return to normal.

 
**Siegfried**
Let's hurry before we have casualties.

 
**Dr. Roman**
We're almost at our destination.
However, I am picking up multiple signatures around it.

 
**Mash**
It's spacious.
...Master, please stand back.

 
**Mash**
The signatures the Doctor mentioned are approaching!

 
**Siegfried**
We're done once we defeat these.
What?

 
**E：???**
...It's been a while, my friend.

 
**Siegfried**
You're!?

 
**E：???**
No need to be surprised.
You're not the only one who obtained the Rheingold.

 
**E：???**
I, Hagen, killed you to acquire it.

 
**Mash**
Hagen...I believe he was the one who killed Siegfried from behind...

 
**Mash**
It seems he was summoned using the Rheingold as the catalyst.

 
**Hagen**
Exactly. Though, I only did it because this guy asked me.
Right, my friend?

 
**Siegfried**
...If you think of me as a friend, stand aside Hagen.

 
**Hagen**
I refuse. This treasure is mine.
I killed you to obtain it.

 
**Hagen**
I won't give it to a wench like Kriemhild.
I won't give it to a coward like you who chose death!

 
**Hagen**
This gold! This treasure!
Everything is mine!

 
**Siegfried**
&ndash;No matter what I say, it will only be an excuse.

 
**Siegfried**
It's true that I am a coward. I should have stood firm,
and found a way to break through.

 
**Siegfried**
That tragedy was not one I schemed...
Even then, there's no doubt that I am responsible.

 
**Siegfried**
...However.
I will retrieve the Rheingold.

 
**Siegfried**
Not for my own greed,
but because it is just.

 
**Hagen**
&ndash;Haha. Says the man who wielded his sword not knowing what is just!

 
**Siegfried**
You're correct. When I was alive,
I wielded my sword in ignorance.

 
**Siegfried**
However, lately I have finally been able to see my own righteousness.

 
**Siegfried**
I will have my wish granted&ndash;
Hagen!


**--BATTLE--**

**Hagen**
&ndash;Hmph, ruin it is.
That's fine, I didn't want this gold in the first place.

 
**Siegfried**
What, you were just venting?

 
**Hagen**
What else did you think it was?

 
**Hagen**
...I was happy when I could drink and joke with you.

 
**Hagen**
I'm the only one that could have assaulted you from behind in that situation.

 
**Hagen**
I can see you wanted it to be by my blade, as you trusted me.

 
**Hagen**
However&ndash;did you not imagine that you would hurt my heart doing so?

 
**Hagen**
Did you not think it would infuriate your wife Kriemhild?

 
**Siegfried**
...You're right.
Seems I knew little about emotions.

 
**Siegfried**
No, more than anything else&ndash;since I was asked to,
I believed nothing else could have been done.

 
**Siegfried**
I showed excessive lack of interest in everything.

 
**Hagen**
You neglected your life, your hope, and most of all your desires.

 
**Hagen**
You may have been fine with that, but you should've noticed those around you couldn't bear it.

 
**Siegfried**
...Yeah.

 
**Hagen**
Then, let me ask you.
&ndash;Do you have any wish as you are now?

 
**Siegfried**
I do. I had decided this from before. In this second life&ndash; I'll protect justice, and be proud of it.

 
**Siegfried**
I care not about the opinions of others.
I merely wish that "I myself want to be as such."

 
**Siegfried**
My dream is&mdash;to be a hero of justice.

 
**Hagen**
...Hmph, such a childish dream, much like you.
But that is fine.

 
**Hagen**
I will entrust the Rheingold to you.
I'm sure you'll be able to deal with it properly&mdash;

 
**Siegfried**
Master, this is what I couldn't tell you earlier.
I neglected myself too much, and ended up causing tragedy.

 
**Siegfried**
I will not repeat my mistake again.
I want to become a hero of justice and prevent it.

 
**Siegfried**
Is it absurd...
to wish for that?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not at all.

---
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It is not absurd.

---
 


 
**Siegfried**
...Thank you Master.
I give you my best regards for the future.
