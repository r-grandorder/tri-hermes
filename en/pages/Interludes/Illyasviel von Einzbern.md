# Illyasviel von Einzbern

<h2>For Whom Do We Shine</h2>

**Illya**
Quintett Feuer!!!

 
**Prisma Coalesced Men☆Gentle**
Gwaaaaaahhhh!!!

 
**Illya**
(Pant, pant) ...
I-I did it...!

 
**Mash**
Annihilation of enemy and nuisance targets confirmed.

 
**Mash**
Good work, Illya and Senpai.
Now we are finally done.

 
**Mash**
I would never have predicted the obsessive thoughts of the Magical Gentlemen, whom we thought we defeated, would come back and attack as Fused Gentlemen...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for that concise explanation, Mash.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was a sad, horrendous battle.


---
 
**Mash**
Yes. Even attempting to talk about it would be a painfully drawn-out conversation... And I don't want to talk about it, so let's forget it.

 
**Illya**
... (Tremble, tremble)

 
**Mash**
...?
Is something the matter, Illya?

 
**Illya**
...My...

 
**Illya**
My entire body aches!

 
**Mash**
A-are you okay!?
Did you injure yourself in the last battle!?

 
**Ruby**
Ah, no...do not fret. She did not commit a blunder like getting touched by a gentleman.

 
**Ruby**
This is something like recoil from her grand attack...or rather a price she has to pay.

 
**Illya**
This happens whenever I use Quintett Feuer... Ruby, is there anything I can do so I don't feel so much pain?

 
**Ruby**
That's a tough one... The attack itself is a bit of a cheat, really, forcing magical energy through bodily systems it's not really meant to be routed through in order to gain an instantaneous firepower boost.

 
**Ruby**
Normally, the blowback you'd feel from something like that would be even more severe, as you well know.

 
**Ruby**
Your body possesses a Spirit Origin stronger than a physical body. That's why you get off with just a hearty round of griping like an old lady!

 
**Illya**
Old lady...

 
**Mash**
I never knew it was such a magnificent attack.

 
**Illya**
Hmmm, but I feel like its gotten weaker compared to when I shot it THAT time.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“That time”?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Which time?


---
 
**Illya**
Uh...um...well, it's a long story...

 
**Ruby**
It was the time when she went up against little big Gilgamesh's Enuma Elish head-on and won.

 
**Mash**
Eh...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ehhhhhh!? Seriously!?
 
**Ruby**
I swear upon this Ruby's bewitching form that story is one hundred percent true!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's from volume five of Prisma☆Illya 2wei!
 
**Ruby**
Exactly! This blatant advertisement is so bold,
even Ruby wants to tip her hat to it!

 


---
 
**Ruby**
But you know...that was only possible because the other party wasn't going all-out...or rather, he was just toying with us, which was our saving grace.

 
**Mash**
W-well...even so, that is truly incredible!

 
**Illya**
I was just so...engrossed in the moment...

 
**Illya**
A-anyway!
I want to get stronger!

 
**Illya**
Ruby. If I'm stronger than my physical body, don't you think I can increase my magical energy output?

 
**Ruby**
Ah, a girl who pursues pure firepower! Yes!

 
**Ruby**
HOOOWEEEVERRR...to cut to the chase,
the problem is actually on your end.

 
**Illya**
Eh? What do you mean?

 
**Ruby**
My only job is to maintain the four systems as pseudo-magical circuits.

 
**Ruby**
The amount of magical energy that goes through them is actually dependent on Illya's willpower.

 
**Illya**
Willpower...?
I think I'm trying my best...

 
**Mash**
Perhaps...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're holding yourself back psychologically.


---
 
**Ruby**
Ah! Way to go! Great, Master!

 
**Ruby**
You catch on fast, like you're a seasoned vet of school girls who are innocent and pure of heart!

 
**Illya**
Putting it that way makes it sound kind of weird...

 
**Ruby**
Now that Miss Illya is just starting to understand euphemisms, teasing her is really fun! Anyway...

 
**Ruby**
The physical repercussions she suffers are serious, and I can only imagine how SERIOUSLY painful they are.

 
**Ruby**
Perhaps she has unconsciously held back her output out of fear of the pain she remembers from the past.

 
**Mash**
That...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Totally understandable.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't push yourself too hard...


---
 
**Illya**
You're worried about me.
Thanks, [♂ big brother /♀️ big sister} Fujimaru.

 
**Illya**
But even so...I want to get stronger.

 
**Mash**
I completely understand.

 
**Mash**
But you're still in elementary school.
Why are you so eager to get stronger?

 
**Illya**
Because...because...if I don't get stronger...

 
**Mash**
If you don't...?

 
**Illya**
People will say I'm weaker than Chloe!

 
**Mash**
...Come again?

 
**Illya**
People will say “Chloe's a much easier character to use,” or “Chloe's NP is stronger”!!!

 
**Illya**
I know...I know I'm weak. I don't have that much magical energy, and I'm bad at making snap decisions in battle...

 
**Illya**
But you know what? No matter how underdeveloped I may be, there's one thing I can't let slide.

 
**Illya**
I don't care if other people best me...
But as the older sister...!

 
**Illya**
I can't let Chloe best me!!!

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Mash**
U-um...it's been a while since I heard such a...um, intense pledge like that. It was almost moving...

 
**Mash**
But I don't think you are weaker than Chloe, Illya.

 
**Mash**
So please calm down...

 
**Illya**
It's true!
Ruby told me everyone is saying that!

 
**Mash**
Ruby!?

 
**Ruby**
Ahahahahaha!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We want to help you, but...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ummmmm...


---
 
**???**
Heh heh heh...I see you are in a bind.

 
**Illya**
Eh? Wh-who's there!?

 
**???**
Hah!!!

 
**???**
I heard it all!

 
**Mash**
Oh, that dark silhouette...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who exactly are you!?


---
 
**Ruby**
...

 
**Ruby**
Oh. Um... Y'know...
To be continued and all that...


**--ARROW--**

**B：???**
I'm going to say it again: I heard it all!!!

 
**Illya**
You're repeating yourself!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That voice...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That succubus-like aura...!


---
 
**Chloe**
Bingo! I'm the big sister who's better than Illya in every way! The one and only Chloe von Einzbern!

 
**Illya**
Chloe!?

 
**Illya**
H-how long have you been listening!?

 
**Chloe**
Hmm...since someone said,
“Congratulations. She's a healthy baby girl.”

 
**Illya**
S-since the moment I was born!?
That's such a big sister thing to say... Wh-why, you!

 
**Ruby**
The “who's the older sister” battle...I still don't understand the rules.

 
**Mash**
Um...sorry to interrupt your sisterly banter, but...didn't you show up because you had business with us, Chloe?

 
**Chloe**
Oh right, right.
It's about Illya.

 
**Chloe**
She's been mumbling “more firepower, more firepower” to herself every day, so I was worried about her.

 
**Illya**
W-was I muttering borderline scary stuff to myself?

 
**Chloe**
Yeah, I seriously considered calling the cops.

 
**Chloe**
Ah well, can't be helped. No matter the era,
the weak always struggle to gain more power.

 
**Chloe**
To support her fervent but futile efforts,
we've all showed up. That's all.

 
**Illya**
Oh that's just infuriating!

 
**Illya**
...Hm?
“We”?

 
**Chloe**
Heh heh heh! Indeed!

 
**Chloe**
Be grateful, Illya. I went ALL over to gather everyone here together, in one place!

 
**Chloe**
Now come on out!
“Illya's Magnificent Strengtheners!”

 
**Stheno**
You talk too much, Chloe. Just how long were you going to keep us in the green room?

 
**Euryale**
Well, the only thing to do about this is to slap my dummy younger sister Medusa's butt once for every second you kept us waiting! (Slap)

 
**Medusa**
Ow! I-I'm sorry...! Sorry to trouble you,
but please speed things up...!

 
**Mash**
The three Gorgon sisters are here...!?
What is going on...?

 
**Illya**
Eh? Wh-what!? What's this
“Illya's Magnificent Strengtheners” about!?

 
**Ishtar**
I usually don't work for free. If you can't pay my price, I'll have to seize some of Chaldea's assets.

 
**Quetzalcoatl**
Nonsense! A lucha match is its own reward, more valuable than jewelry! I will jump even higher than usual, yes!

 
**Artemis**
Yoo-hoo☆ I'm here to beat the pulp out of someone!

 
**Illya**
Again... What the heck!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Look at all these goddesses...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What a sight.


---
 
**Chloe**
These are the seven great goddesses who have answered my call! Together they're called the
“Bully Illya Seven!”

 
**Illya**
It's a different name now!

 
**Illya**
Wait, wait. You can't just collect so many of these UNIQUE people all of a sudden... I don't have any idea how to react to all of this...!

 
**Ruby**
Illya's really not much for processing complicated things.

 
**Chloe**
You want to get stronger, right?

 
**Illya**
(Gasp)

 
**Chloe**
As the big sister, I knew. I knew that my younger sister Illya was agonizing over her ho-hum firepower.

 
**Chloe**
A younger sister can't be mulling over things like that alone. You gotta take action, however impossible.

 
**Chloe**
Illya may always get swept away by those around her, but being the big sister that I am, I believe in her. I know my younger sister has a strong will, however undeveloped she may be.

 
**Illya**
What you're saying sounds kind of good, but I'm also sensing a mocking undertone, and I can't concentrate!

 
**Stheno**
Ah, it's so lovely seeing siblings getting along like this. In consideration of your sisterly love, we shall play along just this once. (Slap, slap)

 
**Euryale**
So you want us to show that younger sister who's boss with a few love taps, right? I'm a little worried. Do you think I am fit to play such a role? (Slap, slap)

 
**Medusa**
Ow! Um...my dear older sisters...!
Please refrain from talking while slapping my butt...!

 
**Illya**
Huh? Um, I sense an imminent battle...but I haven't agreed to anything yet...!

 
**Ishtar**
I'm not sure why, but when I look at her, I feel both affection and a certain sense of caution...

 
**Ishtar**
Perhaps this vessel of mine has some sort of connection to her. Do you think beating her up will help me figure it out?

 
**Quetzalcoatl**
Of course you will, yes! The clash of bodies is a kind of communication that transcends language barriers!

 
**Orion**
Well, a future cutie has asked us to do this.
As a grown-bear, we should fulfill our duties.

 
**Artemis**
After we beat that girl up, I'll be sure to beat you three times harder, my darling!

 
**Orion**
What'd I say!?

 
**Chloe**
Behold. See how these goddesses all talk and act with such...um, individuality! See how they lack anything resembling solidarity!

 
**Chloe**
Y'know, if I'm honest, I don't really know how I got them all here together...

 
**Chloe**
Anyway! This is what Illya needs!
You need to free your heart! Be more open! Buck naked!

 
**Mash**
Perhaps she's saying Illya needs to follow the mentality of these goddesses as examples...

 
**Mash**
I think that's asking a lot.

 
**Ruby**
Ruby does not approve of Illya acting like this lot...but will wholeheartedly approve of her being buck naked!

 
**Illya**
Um, even so, there's no need to fight, right!?
That doesn't make much sense, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Illya.


---
 
**Illya**
Oh! [♂ Big brother /♀️ Big sister} Fujimaru, help! If you don't do something, they'll all beat me up in the name of some weird version of sisterly love!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Good luck.


---
 
**Illya**
[♂ Big brother /♀️ Big sister} Fujimaru, you traitor!!!

 
**Chloe**
Brace yourself, Illya! Be grateful that I've arranged for you to receive the “love” of the goddesses!


**--BATTLE--**

**Stheno**
Phew...I suppose that's it.
That was a nice way to kill some time.

 
**Euryale**
Oh come on! Our dummy of a sister Medusa can't even be a proper meat shield! What is even the point of you being so gigantic, then!?

 
**Medusa**
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry...!

 
**Medusa**
...Um. Good luck, Illyasviel.
As a younger sister myself, I'll be rooting for you.

 
**Ishtar**
What the heck! She's already strong!  But I have to admit, your Noble Phantasm shined brilliantly. It was like a jewel in the Milky Way!

 
**Quetzalcoatl**
Mmmm... ¡Adiós, hermanita! That was a lovely fight!
Let's meet in the ring next time!

 
**Artemis**
Awwww, she beat me up!
Console me fervently and lovingly, Darling!

 
**Orion**
Yeah, yeah. Later.

 
**Orion**
...Sorry about that, missy. Bothering people is practically an occupation for these goddesses. Forgive them, will ya?

 
**Orion**
Well, let me just warn you that you shouldn't get too worked up.

 
**Orion**
There's only so much a single person can bear or do.

 
**Illya**
W-we won!?
I'm beat...both physically and mentally.

 
**Ruby**
The only sane advice we got was from that Orion bear, which makes it even sadder.

 
**Mash**
A-anyway, I have confirmed that the seven goddesses have retreated. Good work, Illya.

 
**Illya**
Ugh...my entire body still hurts...
I want to go home and take a nice bath...

 
**Ruby**
Illya is not one to skimp on self care!

 
**Chloe**
Well, I'm impressed, Illya.
I didn't think you would really beat all seven goddesses.

 
**Chloe**
You beat the seven...
Hm? Seven?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
One, two, three, four, five, six...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There were only six of them.


---
 
**H：???**
Fwahahahahahaha!
Fumeow hahahahahahaha!!!

 
**H：???**
At the behest of a girl who cares for her younger sister...this feral heart roars with maternal love! If you ask for the aid of a jaguar, then I shall be happy to lend my paw!

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
The beautiful goddess of love and the rainy season...the time is meow...for Jaguar Warrior!

 
**Chloe**
Oh... (I forgot I asked this one, too.)

 
**Illya**
Um...

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
I heard there was gonna be a fight, and I couldn't resist! Meowhahahahaha! Know that the Seven Goddess Alliance is no cat...I mean, cakewalk!

 
**Mash**
Um, Jaguar Warrior...

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
Meowhahaha. Good things never wait for you! If there's a deal, pounce on it! Once it's weakened, kill it! That's the law of the jungle!

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
Now come at me! I'm pawsitively pumped!

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
Come on, Ishtarin! Kuku! Let's go in with our ★5-eliminating Delta-Nabla Attack!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry. That just ended.


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior**
...Huh? Where's Ishtarin and Kuku?
And where's the rest of the goddesses?

 
**Ruby**
We beat 'em all.

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
Seriously?
Little girl's too strong.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Time to beat the leftovers.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And now it's tiger season.


---
 
**Illya**
Wait, what was the point of that battle?
I'm really confused now...

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
Tsk. I thought I was getting into a seven-on-one battle, but now it's a one-on-five deathmatch...

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
What's up with me being the lone wolf?
...I'm a feline!!!

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
But this jaguar will not lose! Just you watch! I'll show you that the jaguar's wild nature is going to save human history!!!


**--ARROW--**

**Jaguar Warrior**
Are...you...kitten...me!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
I can't believe I lost to someone who's not even wearing short-shorts! What humiliation!

 
**Jaguar Warrior**
Why you... Perish, magical girls! One day I'll be lurking in the darkness and pounce on you to claim my revenge! Brace yourself for cat-astrophe!

 
**Mash**
All seven goddesses have been defeated...
This time for real.

 
**Mash**
When she fled into the jungle I thought she was planning to use guerilla tactics, but instead she just started shouting for us to come at her one by one... Why?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for the clear-cut explanation.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was a grrreat and fierce battle.


---
 
**Chloe**
Hmmm. Even I don't want to comment on that goddess.
Besides, that tiger wasn't even a goddess.

 
**Ruby**
I feel like whoever tries to give it to her straight is in for a losing battle. Before she saves mankind, she needs to match the setting a little more.

 
**Illya**
Look who's talking!

 
**Chloe**
So...Illya. What do you think?
Did you get stronger?

 
**Illya**
Of course not!
I just got really, really, really tired!

 
**Chloe**
That's weird... Knowing you, I thought for sure that getting cornered would give you a powerup!

 
**Illya**
Quit playing games with my heart!

 
**Mash**
That's enough.
Illya, you've fought so hard, and you're already strong.

 
**Illya**
Thank you, Mash.
Ummmm...but, but...

 
**Chloe**
See? Look how doubtful you are...
It's no wonder you can't get strong.

 
**Chloe**
Come on, stand up straight! If you put your mind to it, you're the type who can win against THAT Enuma Elish!

 
**Ruby**
That's right!
Beat the crap out of that Enuma Elish!!!

 
**Mash**
U-um...perhaps you should tone it down...
If HE ends up hearing you...

 
**Chloe**
You mean that shiny gold guy?
What are you afraid of? We're fine, we're fine.

 
**Chloe**
After all, Illya beat him once!
To hell with that King of Heroes! Come at us!!!

 
**Illya**
S-stop...you're going overboard...!

 
**Chloe**
What about Enuma Elish!?
Our Illya would totally kick its butt!!!

 
**Kid Gil**
Oh? Well, this sure is interesting.

 
**Chloe**
...

 
**Illya**
...

 
**Ruby**
...

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Illya & Chloe**
He, he's here!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Chloe, you've done it now!
 
**Chloe**
I-I didn't think he would actually show up!
B-besides, Ruby was egging me on!

 
**Ruby**
System. Error.
Language functions...shutting down...

 
**Illya**
Don't you dare act like a machine to get out of this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hurry and think of an excuse, Illya!
 
**Illya**
U-um...you see, Mister Kid Gil... The term kicking one's butt is just an expression...a turn of phrase...

 
**Illya**
...Why am I making all the excuses!?

 


---
 
**Kid Gil**
Ahaha! Oh please.
I don't understand why everyone is so scared.

 
**Kid Gil**
I wouldn't get mad over a little joke like that.
I'm not the big me, after all.

 
**Mash**
That's right. Everyone's being rude.
Kid Gil is rational, and he listens.

 
**Mash**
Oh, um! I-I-I'm not saying that the big shiny gold you is an irrational tyrant, you see...!

 
**Kid Gil**
Aha! Listen to you, big sister Mash! Don't get me wrong, I'm praising you! For both statements!

 
**Chloe**
Hmmm? Something's...

 
**Illya**
There's something different about him.
Different than the usual Kid Gil we know...

 
**Kid Gil**
Hello, mirrored big sisters. This is the first time we've actually spoken to each other.

 
**Kid Gil**
...Yep. It appears we are connected in quite the strange twist of fate.

 
**Illya**
You are...
Are you THE Kid Gil we know...?

 
**Kid Gil**
Nope. And I don't know.

 
**Illya**
...???

 
**Chloe**
The way he gets all profound kind of reminds me of him...

 
**Kid Gil**
There's no hidden meaning behind my words.
And a bit of small talk is nice. It's fun.

 
**Kid Gil**
Oh, but dear me. Big sisters, you're not my type, so this is no fun. Not one bit.

 
**Illya & Chloe**
Huh?

 
**Kid Gil**
Yep. Let's just go ahead and battle.

 
**Illya & Chloe**
Huh!?

 
**Mash**
Wh-what do you mean, Kid Gil?
Why do we need to fight...?

 
**Kid Gil**
Hm? Isn't this pretty much where a story about Illya wanting to get stronger leads?

 
**Kid Gil**
You said if she gave it her all, she could overwhelm even my Ea. I sure would like to see that.

 
**Kid Gil**
Now, please.
Try to “blow me away.”

 
**Illya**
U-um...if I dare ask...

 
**Chloe**
Are you mad?

 
**Kid Gil**
I am not mad.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's definitely mad.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everyone, RUN!!!


---
 
**Kid Gil**
Oh, please don't flee.

 
**Chloe**
Oh crap...chains!?

 
**Illya**
Chloe!?

 
**Chloe**
Hey...! Lemme go!
Bound in chains is NOT a good look for a kid!

 
**Kid Gil**
That sorta thing really isn't in my&ndash;never mind.

 
**Kid Gil**
Illya, battle me.

 
**Illya**
...!

 
**Kid Gil**
If you flee, I will kill Chloe.
Oh, and if I win, I will kill Chloe.

 
**Illya**
Wha...!?
That's nonsense, Kid Gil!

 
**Kid Gil**
Hmmm. You're really slow to make a decision, even when you've only got one choice.

 
**Chloe**
Illy... Ungh!
The chains are tightening...!

 
**Mash**
Chloe!
Are you serious, Kid Gil!?

 
**Kid Gil**
I've taken a slight interest in that heart of hers.

 
**Kid Gil**
Since you're a Servant, please hang on and survive even if your ribcage gets caved in, Miss Chloe.

 
**Chloe**
Hey...you...!
Quit joking around...!

 
**Illya**
No more! Stop!

 
**Mash**
Illya?

 
**Illya**
You really are a different person.
Different than the Kid Gil that we know...

 
**Illya**
You may mince your words a lot, and we still don't know what you're really thinking...but...!

 
**Illya**
The Kid Gil we know never did anything cruel!

 
**Illya**
I...will never lose to somebody like that!

 
**Kid Gil**
Finally. Sheesh.
The lady took her sweet time with her costume change.

 
**Kid Gil**
I really don't want to do this, but I guess I can make a bit of a costume change myself.

 
**Mash**
Eh...?
Th-that can't be...!

 
**Kid Gil**
Honestly...I reeeally hate to do this.
But for a few minutes, I'll act immature...

 
**Gilgamesh**
...and get serious about playing. I'm going to school you on how to properly use your energy and your life!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He...uh...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
H-h-he...


---
 
**Mash**
He grew up!!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Illya**
Ungh... Ack...!

 
**Illya**
Quintett Feuer!!!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Ohhhhhhhhh!!!

 
**Mash**
A-amazing!
What a massive magical energy discharge!

 
**Mash**
H-huh!?
Her output's still increasing!?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Haha... I see... I see!

 
**Gilgamesh**
So this is the purpose for which you use your energy and your life!

 
**Illya**
(Pant, pant)
...Hah...hah...

 
**Illya**
I-I won!?
Ooohhh...

 
**Chloe**
Illya!?

 
**Illya**
I-I'm fine.
I'm just out of energy.

 
**Mash**
I didn't think we would really beat Gilgamesh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I believed in you, Illya.
 
**Illya**
Heh...hehe...
Thank you, [♂ big brother /♀️ big sister} Fujimaru.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I believed in you, Chloe.
 
**Chloe**
See? I told you so.
Illya's amazing when she gives her all.

 


---
 
**Ruby**
That was an amazing shot, Illya! It was every bit as powerful as you could be in your heyday!

 
**Kid Gil**
It surpassed my expectations.
Even I was a bit surprised.

 
**Mash**
Yes...indeed...

 
**Kid Gil**
I suppose a girl's dream can truly take her to the stars. Ah, my apologies. That may have sounded a bit pretentious.

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Mash**
...Kid Gil?

 
**Kid Gil**
Yes, I'm Kid Gil.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's alive!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He shrunk!


---
 
**Illya**
Huh!? What happened to that shiny gold guy!?

 
**Kid Gil**
Ah, I'm beat. I shouldn't be tampering with my own Spirit Origin when I'm not used to it.

 
**Kid Gil**
I will not pretend to be an adult anymore. I was given the opportunity to manifest in this form, after all.

 
**Illya**
You pretended!?

 
**Ruby**
He totally played us. That kind of intensity can't possibly be argued away as just a session of pretend.

 
**Illya**
And he's unscathed! I gave it my all,
but it didn't even scratch him?

 
**Chloe**
Now that you mention it, the chains binding me disappeared without me noticing.

 
**Chloe**
Ugh! I don't believe it!
I was played for a fool!

 
**Kid Gil**
Now, now. Please give me some credit.
See? Illya got stronger.

 
**Mash**
That... You're right. Her output was definitely exponentially higher for her final shot.

 
**Illya**
But...why?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She did it for Chloe.
 
**Chloe**
Eh?
For me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Her mind was made up.
 
**Illya**
Um...what do you mean?

 


---
 
**Kid Gil**
Master seems to understand.

 
**Kid Gil**
The reason Illya's output was so-so was because she never had a real reason to unleash her power.

 
**Kid Gil**
She's not a hero, so she doesn't have a mission, honor, or pride... Without a defined cause, nobody can get stronger.

 
**Kid Gil**
Why does she want to have power?
For what purpose does she wield her power?

 
**Kid Gil**
I just pushed her so she could remember, with that awful bit of theater.

 
**Mash**
So Illya wielded her power just now...

 
**Illya**
To...save Chloe...

 
**Ruby**
Now that you mention it, she was strong that one time because she wanted to save the person most dear to her, Miyu. (Touched)

 
**Illya**
I get it...
I didn't want to get stronger...

 
**Illya**
I wanted to be able to protect the people I care about.

 
**Mash**
If protecting someone special is what gives Illya strength...

 
**Mash**
...That is a wonderful power.

 
**Kid Gil**
Simply measuring your power against Chloe's doesn't suit you.

 
**Kid Gil**
Your conviction and your heart must be pure and sincere... They must be beautiful, like a single flower blooming in an empty field.

 
**Kid Gil**
Please never forget that.

 
**Illya**
Yep...
Thank you, Kid Gil!

 
**Illya**
You're a different Kid Gil than the one I know...but you are still you!

 
**Chloe**
(Sigh) Kid Gil ended up stealing the show.

 
**Chloe**
But I did a lot for Illya.

 
**Mash**
Though I did question whether the Magnificent Strengtheners were really necessary...

 
**Mash**
Though in the end, Illya's Noble Phantasm was strengthened, so all's well that ends well.

 
**Kid Gil**
But it still isn't strong enough to beat Ea!

 
**Illya**
Is that really what's important right now!?

 
**Kid Gil**
If this was your true power, then way back, when I lost to you, I must have really been playing around!

 
**Illya**
Wow, he complimented AND dissed me in the same breath!

 
**Ruby**
He may be small, but he's still the King of Heroes! I guess that difficult personality of his sticks around even after he grows up.

 
**Illya**
Argh. Honestly...

 
**Illya**
Say...what...you want...

 
**Mash**
Illya!?
Are you all right?

 
**Illya**
Every...single...limb hurts like it's about to fall off...and I'm sooooooooo tiiiiiired...!

 
**Mash**
Oh.

 
**Chloe**
I guess that doesn't change, does it.

 
**Illya**
Ungh... Chloe...take me to my room...

 
**Illya**
Zzzzzz...

 
**Chloe**
And she fell asleep!

 
**Chloe**
Honestly.
My little sister's such a handful.

 
**Chloe**
Heave-ho.

 
**Illya**
Chloe...

 
**Chloe**
Hm?

 
**Illya**
I'll protect you...always...

 
**Chloe**
...

 
**Chloe**
...Yeah, yeah...big sister...
