# Rama

## Vishnu's Test

**Rama**
U-ungh...

 
**???**
Rama...Rama...

 
**Rama**
Uh...ungh...
Who calls me?

 
**Vishnu**
It is I, Vishnu.
Rama, awaken...

 
**Rama**
Oh, crap, Vishnu!?

 
**Vishnu**
“Crap”?

 
**Rama**
M-my sincerest apologies...!

 
**Vishnu**
Rama. How has everything been going since Fujimaru summoned you?

 
**Vishnu**
Is there anything you feel is missing,
or do you have any immediate concerns?

 
**Rama**
No, Master is always kind to me.

 
**Rama**
Master treats me not as a king,
not as {(M) his /(F) her} retainer, but as a friend.

 
**Rama**
I have not had any complaints since I have been summoned.

 
**Vishnu**
...I see. That was a quick response.
How about during battle?

 
**Rama**
Hahaha. I'm all good on the fighting front!
I would love to show you my power, Vishnu!

 
**Vishnu**
Oh, really? Is that so? That's some big talk.
I never took you for the type to talk that way.

 
**Rama**
Eh?
V-Vishnu...?

 
**Vishnu**
Rama...
Oh, Rama...

 
**Vishnu**
Think back, Rama. Back to when you manifested as a Servant, to when you were given your Noble Phantasm...

 
**Rama**
Eh? Are you talking about another, different Noble Phantasm than my Brahmastra...?

 
**Rama**
Vishnu Baazoo, the Arm of the Great One...oh!

 
**Vishnu**
Rama...
Oh, Rama...

 
**Vishnu**
You! Have! Forgotten! The Noble Phantasm!
With! My! Name! You! Forgot! You can't use it!!!

 
**Rama**
Gyaaaaaahhh!!!
I-I-I-I'm terribly sorry, great Vishnu!

 
**Vishnu**
Well, that won't do, will it?
What's the deal, Rama?

 
**Vishnu**
Did you really not realize until I just reminded you that your Noble Phantasm was sealed!? What have you got between your ears!? Marshmallows!?

 
**Rama**
A-absolutely not! I d-didn't forget It's just... W-well, um, I've never encountered any enemies strong enough to require using your power...

 
**Vishnu**
Oh-ho. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, knowing your power. But then, I suppose you must not have any use for this Noble Phantasm, either.

 
**Vishnu**
Even without your Brahmastra, you'll be fine.

 
**Rama**
But...!
P-please do not go, great Vishnu!

 
**Rama**
I...I was mistaken!
Please, at least leave me my Brahmastra!

 
**Vishnu**
...Very well. If you're that desperate,
I shall give you a chance.

 
**Vishnu**
However, understand that to succeed, you must repeatedly shout my favorite word.

 
**Rama**
Y-yes! Certainly and swiftly!

 
**Vishnu**
Very well. That is the lifestyle that you must always be mindful of. They say that swiftness and decisiveness are most important to a soldier.

 
**Vishnu**
Now, then. I have somewhere for you to travel with your Master. There, you will find the trial I have set for you.

 
**Vishnu**
Know this: should you fail in this trial...you will no longer receive my blessing.

 
**Rama**
You can count on me!

 
**Vishnu**
You must always mind me, and never again forget me... Use your Noble Phantasm properly (...erly...erly...)

 
**Rama**
...And that was my dream.
Please, Master, you gotta help me! Mash, you too!!!

 
**Mash**
...Well, in that case...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do gods really act like that?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Th-that sounds suspicious...

---


 
**Rama**
Hm. Well, actually... The being I spoke to was both the great Vishnu, and not Vishnu at the same time.

 
**Rama**
It's the Vishnu that I envision, since I've never really MET them personally!

 
**Rama**
Besides, the great Vishnu who appears in my dreams doesn't seem to have a fully formed personality and is maybe a bit wacky.

 
**Rama**
But this much I'm certain of: I receive a message from the great Vishnu whenever I lose my way or forget something.

 
**Rama**
It could be my subconscious trying to make me realize that I had unknowingly blinded myself to something...

 
**Rama**
Or perhaps the real great Vishnu is truly sending me a message... I'm honestly not sure.

 
**Mash**
So, you have no clue.

 
**Rama**
Pretty much!

 
**Rama**
Regardless, I'm sure there is some truth to the notion that something is about to happen to me!

 
**Dr. Roman**
True...there may be some truth in Rama's dream.

 
**Mash**
Doctor, what do you mean?

 
**Dr. Roman**
A few hours ago, a minute Singularity formed, and we detected it in America, on the island of Alcatraz.

 
**Rama**
Alcatraz, huh?

 
**Rama**
That's where Sita was...
That place must have something to do with my dream.

 
**Dr. Roman**
With the Sixth and Seventh Singularities remaining, leaving it alone could endanger humanity.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Let's take care of it. Swiftly.

 
**Mash**
Roger that, Doctor.

 
**Rama**
Obviously, you'll take me with you, right?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!

---


 
**Rama**
Ah, my friend!

 
**Fou**
Fou.

 
**Mash**
What is it, Fou?
You're saying it's a friendship of self-interest?

 
**Mash**
That can't be true, Fou.
Right, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I hope not.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Friendship must be true.

---


 
**Rama**
A-anyway, let's get a move on, quickly!
Our trial awaits...probably!

 
**Rama**
A trial, huh? Now that I reflect back,
it seems like my life was full of them.

 
**Dr. Roman**
According to the Ramayana, Rama was first exiled from his homeland when he was a prince.

 
**Rama**
Indeed.

 
**Rama**
My stepmother Kaikeyi suspected that I would treat her unfairly if I became king.

 
**Rama**
Most conspiracies have their genesis in tiny doubts.
I count myself lucky that I wasn't killed, at least.

 
**Rama**
Luckily, my younger brother Lakshmana also came with me. It felt like I was heading out on a long journey rather than getting exiled.

 
**Rama**
And above all, since I had Sita with me, my exile wasn't so bad.

 
**Mash**
And if I remember correctly, Bharata, who was supposed to be king, refused to ascend the throne, and waited for you.

 
**Rama**
Yes. I was fortunate in all respects. I must admit that the fun was confined to the beginning of my journey, though.

 
**Rama**
Everything went downhill after Sita was taken.
Hey, Master...

 
**Rama**
You fight all your battles to restore humanity. I have no hesitation offering my life for that purpose.

 
**Rama**
However, had I been summoned for a proper Holy Grail War, I may have wished for the following:

 
**Rama**
To change the past.
To undo the past where Sita was taken from me.

 
**Mash**
Rama...

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's true that a normal Holy Grail War might be able to grant that wish.

 
**Dr. Roman**
But it could create various distortions. For example, Sita may not have been taken, but the curse may still be there...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Or perhaps, in consequence of your group being saved, your homeland may have met a different fate.

 
**Rama**
...Distortion, huh? I suppose that's what happens when things are changed.

 
**Rama**
In any case, that's all hypothetical.
Let's concentrate on the matter at hand.

 
**Mash**
We've arrived at the coast.
This was where we headed to Alcatraz by boat.

 
**Mash**
It feels so long ago.
I wonder if the old man we met back then is well.

 
**F：???**
I hear he is in good health. But I had him evacuate, because this place is about to become a battlefield.

 
**Mash**
!

 
**Rama**
A hero sent to test me!

 
**F：???**
Indeed.

 
**Rama**
I am King Rama of Kosala!
Hero that I must overcome, please show yourself!

 
**F：???**
Understood.
I did have every intention of doing so eventually...

 
**Rama**
...!

 
**Mash**
It can't be... Karna?!

 
**Karna**
I am your first trial. I shall demonstrate a piercing stare...
I mean, the proper bearing of a hero.

 
**Karna**
A real hero kills with his eyes.
King of Kosala, receive my Brahmastra!

 
**Rama**
Got it. If you're my first opponent, then I have no complaints!

 
**Rama**
I will push my power to its limit!
Let's do this, Master!!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Karna**
...Splendid. This is the end.
I have seen enough of your indestructible blade.

 
**Karna**
I wish I could emulate the valiant, and yet disarmingly honest moves that you retain as a result of being summoned as an inexperienced hero.

 
**Karna**
Move on to the second trial, but proceed with caution.
It may not be as easy as this one.

 
**Rama**
Thank you, Lord Karna. It was an honor to cross blades with a famed hero like you.

 
**Karna**
Compared to the hero awaiting you at the second trial,
I was but a trifling opponent. Go, board the boat.

 
**Rama**
A hero that Karna thinks makes him seem insignificant...

 
**Mash**
Do you think he's being humble?
Karna is quite modest...

 
**Rama**
I hope that's all it is. These are, after all,
heroes gathered specifically for this trial...

 
**Rama**
Which means the next hero is...

 
**Mash**
Master, watch out!

 
**Rama**
An arrow!
So, we're looking for an Archer!

 
**D：???**
You are correct. I am the gatekeeper for this second trial...

 
**D：???**
Rest assured, I will not allow my personal feelings to interfere with this trial.

 
**D：???**
No matter what happened in the past, even if I was on your side...please do not think too much of it.

 
**Rama**
Now we're up against Arjuna...!

 
**Arjuna**
Now, show me this indestructible blade of yours.
I will judge whether you are worthy of wielding it!

 
**--BATTLE--**

**Arjuna**
...Well, it seems you pass.
Something is still missing, but that's hardly a surprise.

 
**Arjuna**
Of course, any Heroic Spirit would find himself lacking when standing in comparison to me.

 
**Arjuna**
Don't you agree?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well you're not...not entirely...not incorrect...?

---
 
**Arjuna**
Puzzling...which is it!?
Do you believe it's true, or not?

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nope.

---
 
**Arjuna**
...Really.
Then shall we battle once more?

 
**Rama**
Waitwaitwait!
I'll have you declare that I've overcome my trial!

 


 
**Arjuna**
Ah. That may have been somewhat childish of me.

 
**Arjuna**
Rama. You are quite perplexing.
You overcame so many trials in your lifetime.

 
**Arjuna**
And, in doing so, you became a full and complete hero.

 
**Arjuna**
Had you not been summoned as your youthful self,
these trials now would be unnecessary.

 
**Rama**
You may be right.

 
**Rama**
It's possible that I could be summoned as an older king, one who would remember Sita, but had also come to terms with what happened to her.

 
**Rama**
Had that version of me been more compatible with Master, it might have been summoned...

 
**Rama**
But it appears that this form was best suited to my Master.

 
**Rama**
And knowing that makes me happy.

 
**Arjuna**
Hm. How heartwarming.
I mean...ahem.

 
**Arjuna**
That is precisely why one must grow stronger.
Even Servants.

 
**Arjuna**
That is the purpose of this trial.
Grow stronger, Lord Rama.

 
**Rama**
...Okay.

 
**Arjuna**
I shall bid you farewell.
The final hero awaits you.

 
**Arjuna**
...He will be your greatest challenge of all.
He is not one to hold back.

 
**Rama**
A hero who doesn't hold back...
I wonder who could that be?

 
**Mash**
It should be all right. Karna and Arjuna were both great and famous heroes.

 
**Mash**
And you defeated both of them, Rama.
You should have more confidence as you go forward.

 
**Rama**
...Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'm ready for anyone!

 
**Rama**
No matter who the opponent, I'll squash them!

 
**D：???**
...Oh? What's this?
It seems a yammering mongrel approaches.

 
**Rama**
Wha...!?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Nothing to be surprised about.
You summoned me here.

 
**Gilgamesh**
I am Gilgamesh, King of Heroes,
and I crush you underfoot.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Battle with Sabers&ndash;any Saber&ndash;never fails to excite me.

 
**Rama**
Ugh...Gilgamesh!!!
They always save the greatest challenge for last...

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fuhahaha! Do you think this trial is just about going up against a tough opponent!? Wrong!

 
**Gilgamesh**
The true trial isn't just a matter of defeating me. As if a mongrel like you could ever defeat the likes of me!

 
**Dr. Roman**
(Nice to see he's still completely full of himself...)

 
**Gilgamesh**
One who still needs to prove his strength through battle will be of no use in the Restoration of Humanity.

 
**Gilgamesh**
So show yourself!

 
**Sita**
Rama...
Lord Rama, is that you?

 
**Rama**
...

 
**Rama**
That voice...
It can't be. Sita!?

 
**Sita**
Yes, it is I.

 
**Sita**
It seems the great Vishnu arranged for me to be summoned on this land once again.

 
**Rama**
I'm so glad...!

 
**Gilgamesh**
Hahahaha. Excited, are you not, King of Kosala?
Why do you think your wife is on my side?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's a hostage...?

---
 
**Gilgamesh**
Fool! What use would I, who is sure to be the victor here, have for a hostage!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's our enemy...?

---
 
**Gilgamesh**
Exactly.
Your final trial is a trial of love.

 


 
**Sita**
Lord Rama...
The great Vishnu has lifted our curse.

 
**Sita**
We can be together now...forever.

 
**Rama**
What...!?

 
**Rama**
Th-that is most generous of Vishnu...
I'm grateful, sincerely...

 
**Rama**
But Sita, why are you on his side?

 
**Sita**
The great Vishnu was kind enough not only to lift our curse, but also to grant my wish...

 
**Sita**
I wished that my Lord Rama would never be hurt...would be spared these endless battles.

 
**Sita**
Please, join us, Lord Rama.
Leave the Restoration of Humanity to the others.

 
**Sita**
If there are as many heroes as stars in the sky, what is one fewer? We should be able to have our peace, to have our happiness...

 
**Rama**
...

 
**Rama**
Are you saying, that I can be with you as long as I break my contract with Master?

 
**Sita**
Yes, it is I.

 
**Rama**
...

 
**Rama**
Then I know that you are a fake.

 
**Rama**
I could never deserve such a reward without overcoming my trials.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Oh?

 
**Sita**
If you're calling me a fake,
then the same must be true of you...

 
**Rama**
This is not about being a Servant or Heroic Spirit.

 
**Rama**
First of all, you're not even a Servant.

 
**Rama**
...Yeah, I know... I understand, and I know this is an offer I must refuse.

 
**Rama**
But...well...you know...Master...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I get it.

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you all right?

---


 
**Rama**
Rejecting loved ones is so hard.

 
**Rama**
How, in my past life...even if it was to avoid unnecessary bloodshed...

 
**Rama**
How did I manage to go through with this?

 
**Sita**
...I see. So you mean to reject me.

 
**Gilgamesh**
(Even though his rank as a Heroic Spirit is far beneath mine, he does not waver in his beliefs. Impertinent mongrel.)

 
**Rama**
I can't do it, Sita.
That is the one thing I cannot do.

 
**Rama**
To break my contract with Master would mean doing the same thing I did to you, Sita.

 
**Rama**
I know I'm not supposed to let go this time.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Heh. What will you do, queen?
You heard what your husband said.

 
**Sita**
If he rejects my love, then the only thing left to do is to devour him...! That's my only option!

 
**Gilgamesh**
...What?

 
**Mash**
...Um, does it look like Gilgamesh is also surprised?

 
**Gilgamesh**
Fuhahahaha! Why, humanity's on the brink of collapse. This sort of strangeness is to be expected.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Now, small king of a smaller nation. It is time for you to face your final trial: this monster...and me!

 
**Rama**
Yeah, let's do this!

 
**Rama**
Brahmastra!
Shine...like you did back then!


**--BATTLE--**

**Gilgamesh**
...Hmph.
Battle's over.

 
**Gilgamesh**
You may be bleeding from a hundred wounds,
but your trial is over.

 
**Rama**
(Pant...pant...pant...)

 
**Sita**
Rama...
My dear Rama...

 
**Rama**
...Next time...we meet...I'll go...see you...I'll be sure to walk tall and proud...

 
**Sita**
...Okay...

 
**Sita**
If you tell the real Sita...she'll likely...

 
**Gilgamesh**
Sheesh. I heard somewhere that even Lancers (better known as dogs) prefer to stay out of lovers' spats.

 
**Mash**
Lancers...?

 
**Gilgamesh**
You had to be there.
Anyway, this is the end of your trial.

 
**Gilgamesh**
Young king of a small nation, it's all right to agonize over this kind of thing, but not in public. Understand?

 
**Rama**
Trials...

 
**Rama**
This might have been for the best.
This body and psyche of mine are both still immature.

 
**Rama**
A fake Sita agitating me so much proves that.

 
**Rama**
But hear me out, Master: I will show you my strength in overcoming adversity.

 
**Rama**
And if that helps me grow stronger to protect you and Sita...that just means I'm going in the right direction.

 
**Rama**
Now, Master, our journey to restore humanity continues.

 
**Rama**
Let's go!
