# Carmilla

<h2>Alone, Again</h2>

**Carmilla**
...Master, Master.

 
**Carmilla**
Wake up, Master.
I said, wake up, Master.

 
**Carmilla**
...
...

 
**Carmilla**
Which is your desire, Master;
the Iron Maiden or the Brazen Bull?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are you talking about?!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where am I?!
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
No idea.
How should I be expected to know such a thing?

 
**Carmilla**
Yet, quite clearly it is a pleasant place.
Your pet and companion are here as well.

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
Are you awake, Master?
...We're trapped somewhere.

 
**Mash**
It appears we're in some sort of Reality Marble&ndash;
I'm unable to contact Dr. Roman either.

 
**Carmilla**
It doesn't just appear to be, it most certainly is.
This is my castle, after all.

 
**Mash**
What do you mean, "your castle?"&ndash;

 
**Carmilla**
That's right, this is the Castle Csejte.
It's best that you don't wonder off somewhere.

 
**Carmilla**
The chances of escaping this castle are a mere one in one thousand. You really ought to relax and wait.

 
**Mash**
But...

 
**Carmilla**
At any rate, I know this castle and I'm not going anywhere.

 
**Carmilla**
I am quite comfortable here, after all.
The smell of blood here is so, so dear to me.

 
**Mash**
Ugh.
...What should we do, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's move on.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's escape.
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
...Wait a moment, Master.
Did you not listen to a word I said?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I heard every word.
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
In that case, surely you know that you won't find any lies or deception in my words.

 
**Carmilla**
Ask your companion, there. Have her tell you the blood-splattered legend of Elisabeth Báthory.

 
**Mash**
...I'll admit, it's exactly as Carmilla says.

 
**Mash**
The only person to ever to escape here was a one single maiden out of a thousand.

 
**Mash**
I do believe your safest choice is to wait here...patiently.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We've been imprisoned.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's no help coming for us.
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
...!

 
**Mash**
You're right. After all...if this is Castle Csejte, we have been imprisoned...!

 
**Mash**
The longer we wait, the more likely we'll be sacrificed...

 
**Carmilla**
Ugh. J-Just how foolish can this woman be?
Do you understand? This is MY castle.

 
**Carmilla**
How could I be locked inside my own castle?
Such self-injurious action would never be...never be...

 
**Carmilla**
...ok, it's completely possible.

 
**Carmilla**
To drain the blood from a beautiful maiden. To skewer a hateful rival. If it were for that purpose, it is a possibility.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Let's get out of here.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Okay, we're escaping.
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
...As infuriating as it is, I'd have to say that is the proper choice. For the moment, I think I shall follow your orders.

 
**Mash**
What about traps...?

 
**Carmilla**
Do you think I would bother with such trivial matters?
All I did was give the order, "Don't allow anyone to escape."

 
**Carmilla**
As to what manner of security measures were taken, do you think I would bother myself with that?

 
**Mash**
...Uh, well.
Do you have any advice on how to escape?

 
**Carmilla**
None whatsoever. Why do you look at me that way?
You are a mere commoner&mdash;Eek!?

 
**Carmilla**
A hand extending from the wall?!
What is this? A haunted mansion?

 
**Mash**
It's a Golem!
The wall has transformed!

 
**Mash**
I'll destroy it!
Stand back, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Carmilla**
...I'll admit, I do regret my actions a little bit.
Not knowing anything can be quite a scary thing.

 
**Carmilla**
But, I will say this. Master, if you ever make a mockery of my foolishness, it's the Iron Maiden for you.

 
**Mash**
Ummm, I don't see an exit anywhere...

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
Fou?
Don't rush ahead like that...!

 
**Fou**
Fou, fou!

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Mash**
Master, stay close by!
It's an enemy!

 
**Carmilla**
But this is no Golem.
Yes...It appears we finally meet the true foe.

 
**???**
&ndash;I hate you!

 
**???**
&ndash;I cannot stand you!
I will never, ever forgive you!

 
**Carmilla**
Mere phantom of this castle... You weakest of the weak,
lowest of the low! How dare you stand before me!

 
**Young Girl**
What did you say? ...Just because you are a noble...
you killed me...How dare you...How dare you!

 
**Carmilla**
That's right. Being a noble is my way of life. I am afraid to say that I am not the type to be tormented by guilt.

 
**Carmilla**
I am evil. Utter and thorough evil. Void of salvation,
I am a ludicrous beast that died in sheer despair.

 
**Carmilla**
However, I am not so foolish to have regretted my evil and lost sight of what lies before me.

 
**Carmilla**
It was perfectly logical to curse me, but to invite these ones in as well was foolish.

 
**Carmilla**
You will receive pity if you were to only curse me, to curse all of those living, then you're no better than me.

 
**Carmilla**
In that case&mdash;I shall crush you, without a shred of mercy.

 
**Carmilla**
Even if you are a phantom, I will wring every last drop of blood from you!


**--BATTLE--**

**Carmilla**
...Hmph! The hem of my dress has been torn.
That was somewhat of an inconvenience.

 
**Carmilla**
Let us be on our way, Master.
The exit shouldn't be far.

 
**Carmilla**
...

 
**Mash**
What's the matter, Carmilla?

 
**Carmilla**
Nothing at all. Only a slight headache.
...Master, let me ask you this.

 
**Carmilla**
This is just an "if." If the door does not open...
and we are truly locked in this castle, what will you do?

 
**Carmilla**
Would you give up in despair?
Or would you&ndash;?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I would find another exit.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I would not give up.
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
...I see.
I figured you would say as much.

 
**Carmilla**
Even in such a desperate situation, you'll continue fighting without giving up.

 
**Carmilla**
Just because you've been imprisoned,
you're not the type to lie down and give up.

 
**Mash**
An enemy!
It's a&ndash;Shadow Servant...!?

 
**Carmilla**
Oh, dear... I am imprisoned again.
Again, I am all alone.

 
**Carmilla**
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again there is no one to rescue me...!!

 
**Carmilla**
No! No! Stop...! I don't want to go back to that place! No! No! Noooo!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pull yourself together!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I will rescue you this time.
 


---
 
**Carmilla**
...!
Master...

 
**Mash**
Here it comes...!

 
**Carmilla**
&ndash;So it is.
Now, I am your Servant.

 
**Carmilla**
Even though it was my fate to become imprisoned, it is illogical that you should be imprisoned as well.

 
**Carmilla**
Master! Mash! Listen to me closely.
This is merely "darkness!"

 
**Carmilla**
It is a darkness that envelopes this castle, preventing escape. It is the final barrier, the absolute ruler.

 
**Carmilla**
I cannot overcome this alone.
But now, I have you with me.

 
**Carmilla**
To battle! Now is the time for me to make these ones pay for what has been done!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
We destroyed them!
We can open the door...!

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Carmilla**
...Well done.
You have successfully escaped.

 
**Mash**
What about you, Carmilla?

 
**Carmilla**
Never mind me. You go on.
You should return to Chaldea.

 
**Carmilla**
This place is nothing more than a world of my own imagining.

 
**Carmilla**
As long as my fate has been determined, there is no hope of my escaping this place.

 
**Carmilla**
You see, for me to escape imprisonment would be a rejection of my life, my fate, my everything.

 
**Carmilla**
However&ndash;You are different. I must help you. Even if the chances are one in a thousand, I must help my Master.

 
**Carmilla**
...Do not worry. This is a dream. Merely a nightmare. You will forget all of it when you awake.

 
**Carmilla**
In matter of fact, what if...

 
**Carmilla**
What if, I had met someone like you when I was "Elisabeth."

 
**Carmilla**
What if, I had reached out to a beacon of light like you.
Then I&ndash;

 
**Carmilla**
&ndash;Oh!
You're awake! Master.

 
**Carmilla**
...Why, you look as if you were struck by a popgun.
Did you have a strange dream?

 
**Carmilla**
That's right. It was just a dream. Put it out of your mind. More importantly, it is still night time.

 
**Carmilla**
There is still time before morning comes.
Go back to sleep once more.

 
**Carmilla**
And this time&ndash;have a pleasant dream.
Good night, Master.
