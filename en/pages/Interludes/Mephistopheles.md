# Mephistopheles

<h2>Tick Tock, Bang!</h2>

**Mephistopheles:**
&ndash;Now then, now then.
I have a hypothesis for you, my Master.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I know this is sudden.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
But this world is ruled by an oppressor.
Yes, a bad person. A very bad person!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And so I've taken it upon myself to fix this.
By blowing things up!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And I want your help, you see.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Stalk the streets of London at night with me,
and we'll set bombs!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Huge, amazing explosions! Dreadnought-class disaster!
Come, let us travel to London!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, Mash? Would you like to come with us?
You're more than welcome.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
If you can? If you've nothing better to do?
If you want to spoil the fun?

 
**Mash:**
I'll go with you no matter what, Master.
Being alone with him seems like suicide.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Hehe, hehehehehe! Yes, of course!
You must be ready for anything!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And off we go, everyone!

 
**Mash:**
...He dragged us off so quickly I didn't have time to object.

 
**Mash:**
I guess we've got no choice. I can't contact the Doctor, so we'll just have to follow him.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!
We start with golems, it seems!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
This must be a test of our abilities.
Come, Master.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Let's tear them apart!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mephistopheles:**
Heheh, too easy! Too easy!
Weaker than the weakest of insects.

 
**Mash:**
Golems... So our opponent is a mage, is that right, Mephistopheles?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...Indeed!
Well, basically.

 
**Mash:**
...Basically...?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now, now, don't worry about it! Let's go!
Let's fight!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now we have to set up the bombs.
Beep, beep, beep!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Begin&ndash;the countdown!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And look, more enemies!
Oh, how boring, just so boring.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ye who possess no Command Spells, no arrogance, no pride, and no greed. My past Master!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
As your Servant, I shall finish you off without any hesitation!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mephistopheles:**
And now, time for our next bomb.
Let's go, Master.

 
**Mash:**
...Um, Master.
Something...seems strange...

 
**Mash:**
No, sorry.
Either way, it's clear that the enemy is trying to kill us.

 
**Mash:**
For now, let's cooperate with Mephistopheles.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Hehehehehe.
The next bomb goes here.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And look, the enemy arrives!
Just what you'd expect, right?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Another homunculus?
That Alchemist never changes, does he?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Master, let us kill them!
For justice! Hyahahaha!

 
**Mash:**
Alchemist?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mephistopheles:**
Two more bomb sites left to go. This right arm here is incredibly important to him, isn't it?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now, then, shall I finish him off?
Setting the bomb!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And now here comes the enemy!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Whew!
Mephistopheles, this is the last one, right?

 
**Mash:**
...You can tell us now.
The enemy was your former Master&ndash;

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Indeed! Indeed!
Dr. Georg Faust!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
He forged me, he raised me, he feared me!
And these bombs are a present for him.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
So he can live and die with a smile on his face.
Now, time for the last battle!

 
**???:**
&ndash;So you're here, Mephistopheles.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Of course I am, Faust!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, oh! What a pathetic joke you are!
How comical and beautiful!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You're so ugly now I can't bear it!

 
**Faust:**
Shut up, you failure of a project.
It was foolish of me to grant you self-awareness.

 
**Faust:**
And now you've even betrayed your master&ndash;!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
How could I not, when you're so boring?

 
**Faust:**
You bastard...

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Yes, it's because you're boring!
You were such an ordinary mage!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You sacrificed others as if it was ordinary and yet reaped no results at all!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You pretended to chase distant, unseen dreams and yet wasted your time on your ordinary life!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
How boring!
What a boring mage you are!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
So why should I be blamed for taking a boring, average mage and making him famous throughout history?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Poor little Mephistopheles just doesn't understand.

 
**Faust:**
You... I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, Mephistopheles!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Come on and try it.
Now, my entertaining Master!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
This is the last battle!
Shove that bomb up his butt!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Faust:**
Gahh... Aggh!
...You...traitor!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh no no. I granted your wish to never be forgotten, did I not?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Without me, would Goethe ever have written Faust?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And without Faust, no one would have ever heard of you!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Hehehehehe! If you want someone to blame, blame Goethe! ..Bwah, ahahahahahaha!

 
**Faust:**
Damn you! Damn you! My curse upon you!
My curse upon you, Mephistopheles!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You're such a fool. A curse?
Curses are like power-ups for me.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now then. The bomb is set.
And it's time to flip the switch.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
&ndash;My thanks for playing along with that entertainment.
Master, as long as you entertain me&ndash;

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I will never betray you.
Probably... Ahahahaha!


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Master. What's wrong?
You're soaked with sweat.

 
**Mash:**
Did you have a bad dream?

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's nothing.

**Fujimaru 2:**
...

**Mash:**
...?
What do you think happened, Fou?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...?
