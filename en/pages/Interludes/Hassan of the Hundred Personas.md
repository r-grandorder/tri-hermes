# Hassan of the Hundred Personas

<h2>Hundred Personas Looking for Something</h2>

**Hundred Personas**
Excuse me, Master.
May I have a word with you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Welcome, Hundred Personas.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Welcome, Asako.
 
**Hundred Personas**
Why did you call me that?

 
**Hundred Personas**
...No, never mind.

 
**Hundred Personas**
As we are a conglomerate, our existence is unique.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Even though you are contracted with multiple Servants, things involving us are sure to still bewilder you.

 
**Hundred Personas**
And calling us by name is probably one of them. We are fine with whatever name you choose to differentiate us.

 


---
 
**Mash**
Hello, Hundred Personas.
What a surprise to see you in Senpai's room.

 
**Mash**
I just brought over some tea.
Would you like to join us?

 
**Hundred Personas**
...

 
**Hundred Personas**
No, if Master is busy, that's fine.
Please excuse us.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait, wait.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did something happen?


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, please wait. If you leave now, I will not be able to enjoy tea time because I will be so curious.

 
**Mash**
If you have something on your mind,
please do not hesitate to mention it.

 
**Mash**
Oh. Is it something that you cannot say because I'm around? If so, I can leave&ndash;

 
**Hundred Personas**
...No, actually we wanted to ask Master a favor.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A favor?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
Yes. We need the assistance of someone familiar with the layout of Chaldea and who knows where people in it can be found.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Which is to say, we will probably need Mash's help, too.

 
**Hundred Personas**
If you don't mind, we would like you to listen, too, Mash.

 
**Mash**
Of course. If there is anything I can do,
I'm happy to help.

 
**Mash**
So...what is this favor?

 
**Hundred Personas**
Well, to put it simply:
we would like you to help us find somebody.

 
**Mash**
Find...somebody?

 
**Mash**
If you're looking for a staff member or Servant, we can just use the PA system to ask them to come here.

 
**Hundred Personas**
We considered that approach, but if she could answer such a call, we would have found her a long time ago.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Actually, ever since we were Summoned,
we have been looking for her in our spare time.

 
**Hundred Personas**
We did not go as far as make an announcement, but we did shout out her name, peek inside rooms, and check all the hallways.

 
**Hundred Personas**
But since we still haven't come across her...

 
**Hundred Personas**
She either doesn't want to answer the call,
or she simply can't.

 
**Hundred Personas**
That was our conclusion.
That's why we need to search for her.

 
**Mash**
I see...this is starting to sound like a case that needs to be solved!

 
**Mash**
So who is this person you are searching for?

 
**Hundred Personas**
...Um, well...it's quite embarrassing, but...

 
**Hundred Personas**
it's...

 
**Mash**
Hm? Um, you were kind of mumbling there, so I didn't hear you.

 
**Hundred Personas**
A-anyway! We're all in good hands now that Master and Mash are here to help us!

 
**Hundred Personas**
Now let's get out there and start searching!

 
**Mash**
Oh, she headed out so eagerly...

 
**Mash**
There's still so many questions left,
but let's just go after Hundred Personas, Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you have any clues?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
Well, she is almost certainly inside Chaldea,
but other than that, we have no clues.

 
**Mash**
So you're going into this blind?

 
**Mash**
To search every nook and cranny somewhere as vast as Chaldea could take a long time!

 
**Hundred Personas**
There is no need for concern. We have full knowledge of her personality, characteristics, and abilities.

 
**Hundred Personas**
We have some limited insight into what might happen around her, or what she might do...

 
**Hundred Personas**
So we ask Master to lead us to places where she might be.

 
**Mash**
I see...rather than sleuthing, you already have a few places in mind to search.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Exactly.
Now, the first place we would like to go is...

 
**Mash**
This...is where you wanted to go...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Interesting...here...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Then, let's go!

 
**Mash**
Um, why are you pulling out your dagger and swinging it around before you enter!?

 
**Mash**
Hundred Personas?
Hundred Personas!?

 
**Blackbeard**
Dufufufu...pretty girl figurines are the BEST. It's like two and three dimensions got together and made the baby of my dreams!

 
**Blackbeard**
This plump yet oh so flat belly is to DIE for...
Ahhh, this sculpt is a work of ART!

 
**Blackbeard**
That devilish whim called adolescence...the wonderful transition between girlhood and womanhood that lasts only the briefest of moments...

 
**Blackbeard**
This delicate balance can only be expressed through microscopic adjustments...a technique and craftsmanship that can only be achieved by steady-handed experts.

 
**Blackbeard**
That soft skin...and the bouncy bits...all to convey that age. It's so...ah, marvelous!

 
**Blackbeard**
 
Nugh!? This Blackbeard's eyes can't be deceived!
Th-this figure...has cast-off parts?!

 
**Blackbeard**
Colchis Brand figures...always a high quality brand!

 
**Blackbeard**
You never disappoint.
It's already a superb piece of work...

 
**Blackbeard**
But to put even more curvaceous elements and incorporate the third-dimensional sense of being able to take off clothes...!

 
**Blackbeard**
This has gotta be a challenge for the great Blackbeard. Taunting me! To strip it, or not to strip it...

 
**Blackbeard**
But don't underestimate me! I don't have a problem displaying my figures in my room after they've been stripped!

 
**Blackbeard**
Even if my parents see them, I would proudly declare: “Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend!”

 
**Blackbeard**
This is how a REAL man lives!

 
**Blackbeard**
...And now, if you'll excuse me...
I'll take a little taste...

 
**Blackbeard**
Aaagh!?

 
**Blackbeard**
...Oh no...the edge of the figure's clothes...

 
**Blackbeard**
Apologize! Apologize to the expert craftsman (aka Medea) who worked so tirelessly on every frill of the figure's skirt!

 
**Hundred Personas**
Tsk. We missed.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What was that all about!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even pervy otaku like Blackbeard have rights. Maybe.


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
Hmph. You saw what kind of man he is.

 
**Hundred Personas**
He loves cute things to an almost sickening level, and his greed drives to make them his own. And he feels joy from managing and observing them...

 
**Hundred Personas**
If the one we are searching for has been captured,
this creep would naturally be the first suspect.

 
**Mash**
The reason why Hundred Personas cannot find who they are looking for is because they've been captured and imprisoned by Blackbeard!?

 
**Mash**
Th-that's a bit far-fetched&ndash;

 
**Blackbeard**
Totally!
I'm being framed! Totally blameless!

 
**Blackbeard**
There are tons of angels in Chaldea of prime age,
like Mary and Jack...

 
**Blackbeard**
But that's exactly why I always try to interact with such angels at the borderline acceptable level!

 
**Blackbeard**
After all, if I “accidentally” touch or hug them,
I'd get killed!

 
**Hundred Personas**
But that only means that if there were no such risks, you WOULD do that sort of thing.

 
**Hundred Personas**
The one we're seeking is not risky or dangerous at all. They are just small. Just cute.

 
**Blackbeard**
Eh? What kind of rare angel is that?
Are they around? Where? Where's my camera???

 
**Hundred Personas**
We knew it.

 
**Hundred Personas**
There's a possibility that he would trick them with enticing words, or drag them back to his lair.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Fess up. Refuse, and it's just a matter of us annihilating you first, or we can search your room!

 
**Blackbeard**
Tch...
Give me a break.

 
**Blackbeard**
Blackbeard may be bad, but I'm no low-level scum who can't be proud his own way of life.

 
**Blackbeard**
If I were to fall in love with a girl, it'd only be because it's mutual. I'd get her parents' permission!

 
**Blackbeard**
And then head off to a church to get married.
That's the route to a True End!

 
**Hundred Personas**
 
Th-there's no way we're giving her away to scum like you! We will not allow it!

 
**Mash**
This has taken a turn for the insane,
but let's try to calm things down, Senpai!


**--BATTLE--**

**Blackbeard**
Fuuuuuu!!!

 
**Blackbeard**
Here I was in MY OWN room, minding my business, just admiring my lovely figures, and you go all aggro! What did I do to deserve this!?

 
**Hundred Personas**
...Not here.
We were wrong.

 
**Blackbeard**
I told you I didn't know what you were on about as soon as you got here...

 
**Blackbeard**
My brand new figure...broken...ungh...Blackbeard's gonna cry... (Sniff)...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Ugh. Don't cry while we're here.
Disgusting.

 
**Blackbeard**
SHOCK!

 
**Mash**
You mustn't, Hundred Personas. Blackbeard may be bad, but he's a pure-hearted dreamer when it comes to his hobbies.

 
**Mash**
Even if disavowing his hobby is the right thing to do, it'll only result in his mental collapse!

 
**Blackbeard**
What, it's okay to insult me in front of my face now!? Even you are so cruel today, Miss Mash!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Give it up...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just accept it...


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
It was all just a misunderstanding.
The one we're looking for is not here.

 
**Hundred Personas**
We must apologize.

 
**Blackbeard**
 
Apology!? Do you think apologizing will fix my poor, beloved figure!?

 
**Blackbeard**
This...this girl...an elven-eared craftsman worked her hardest to make this figure by hand. There's no chance of getting another one...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hm. Will you accept our apology if this thing gets fixed? We'll send Dew Painter over to you later.

 
**Blackbeard**
WH-WHAT!?
You can fix it?

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hah...don't underestimate the Hundred Personas. Our one hundred specializations are not just on the battlefield.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Dew Painter, as that name suggests, can paint anything in any color and is an expert at befuddling the enemy through coloring.

 
**Hundred Personas**
He should be an expert in sculpting, if I remember correctly. He did say that magical reconstruction is one of his favorite tasks.

 
**Hundred Personas**
To further improve this figure to match your greatest desire should be no harder than a snap of the fingers to him.

 
**Blackbeard**
...!!!

 
**Blackbeard**
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

 
**Blackbeard**
So, first I want these knee-high socks to be gone to show off her healthy thicc legs, and I'll add glasses, a recorder instrument, and a ribbon...and her clothes will be partially off, and her sides...

 
**Mash**
Um, maybe you hit him a on the head a little too hard... He's fainted, but he's still grinning...

 
**Hundred Personas**
So we were wrong about the first suspect,
but we cannot give up yet.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Let's head to the next suspect.
Master, Mash. Please lead the way.


**--ARROW--**

**Mash**
Based on what happened with Blackbeard,
we're looking for someone small and cute.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sure we'll find them soon.
 
**Mash**
Yes.
Let's keep that positive attitude.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I hope we find them.
 
**Mash**
Someone small and cute... Well, there are a lot of people like that in Chaldea.

 
**Mash**
If that's all we have to go on...

 


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
She's shy, so you've definitely never met her before.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Please let us know if you see someone fitting that description immediately.

 
**Mash**
By the way, who is looking for this person?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it just you, Asako?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it just you?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
No, this is very important to all of us. I am not the only one looking. The rest of the personas are also on the lookout.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hn...speak of the devil. Take a look.
Gozul the Strong is over there.

 
**Gozul the Strong**
Hnnnngh!

 
**Beowulf**
Hahaha.
Good work! That's the spirit!

 
**Beowulf**
...Oh crap. This is no time to laugh.
I'll lose my grip if I don't keep my stomach taut.

 
**Beowulf**
You're as strong as you look! You're no Grendel,
but you still got some potential!

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
That ain't fair, Wulf. Were you all talk when you said you'd end it in an instant? This ain't a competition of stamina.

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
I'm a big idiot who enjoys a game of arm wrestling or two. A valiant match is nice and all, but hurry up and switch&ndash;

 
**Gozul the Strong**
...(Makes a “come at me” gesture)

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Oh? Don't tell me you want me to get in on this, too!?

 
**Gozul the Strong**
...(Grin)

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Whooo! This guy's tough! This'll be GOLDEN! This guy's gonna go up against me and Wulf at the same time...one with each arm!

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Heh, you're underestimating us!
A bastard like you...I love it!

 
**Beowulf**
Yeah, so laughable.
This guy's got a hothead.

 
**Beowulf**
...But we can get irritated after the match's over.

 
**Beowulf**
The information you want from us is more valuable than the two of us. We know not to laugh at that!

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hm. Looks like Gozul is trying to get those two to tell him the information we need by beating them in an arm wrestling match.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Look at all those bulging muscles...amazing...


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
Overall combat efficiency aside, Gozul is probably the strongest of all of us when it comes to sheer arm power. I do not think he is at a disadvantage.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hm. And I see Makul the Quick over there by the halls.

 
**Makul the Quick**
Fwoosh...!

 
**Atalante**
Hm. What amazing speed.

 
**Atalante**
But I won't lose sight of someone in a footrace!
And you are in my turf!

 
**Martha**
 
Hey!!! Who's running in the halls!? WALK QUIETLY.
No matter how rushed you are, you do not run!

 
**Martha**
I will get on Tarasque and chase down rule breakers to the ends of the earth!!!

 
**Hundred Personas**
And Makul's doing some kind of competition of his own.
I see...a hunter's eyes may have spotted her.

 
**Hundred Personas**
And...oh, there's Zayed the Base over there.

 
**Zayed the Base**
...

 
**Nero**
Ungh!
Impressive!

 
**Nero**
As the Roman Emperor, the incarnation of art itself...and obviously versed in dance, too...I am impressed with your graceful, elegant movements!

 
**Nero**
You are no ordinary person! Surely you must be able to gracefully avoid security sensors like that!

 
**Mata Hari**
You're right. They possess unique and wonderful rhythm. I'm learning a lot, tee hee.

 
**Mata Hari**
Wait. We can't just sit here watching, or all we are is an audience. I need to dance my heart out too.

 
**Zayed the Base**
...Wait. Why am I in a dance contest?
Dancing is hardly my area of exp&ndash;

 
**Hundred Personas**
Well, that's...yes, Zayed. I don't think you should worry too much about Zayed. Probably for the best.

 
**Mash**
Um...so all your personas are putting their skills to practical use to collect information on their own.

 
**Hundred Personas**
That is our strength.
Diversity through one hundred specialties.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Someone's weakness may be someone else's strength. As such, we have limitless options for moving through the shadows.

 
**Hundred Personas**
In that area, we believe we are the greatest among the Hassans.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So what's your strength...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So what's your strength, Asako...?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
Well, I do have a proper skill I'm versed in...

 
**Hundred Personas**
But for some reason, lately I've been in the role of gathering and coordinating the others.

 
**Hundred Personas**
This is likely because there are just so few of us who can communicate with Master properly.

 
**Hundred Personas**
...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Speaking of communicating, I realize that she also has difficulty doing so...which is why something like this happened in the first place.

 
**Mash**
Hundred Personas?

 
**Hundred Personas**
No, nothing.
I'm just talking to myself.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Now, then.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Even though we have one hundred specialties, we are up against famed Heroic Spirits. None of these competitions will be easy.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Since I have a bit of free time, I'm thinking of helping the others out if I get a chance.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean, “help out”?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A-are we allowed?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
There's no need to worry, Master.

 
**Hundred Personas**
After all, we are us.

 
**Hundred Personas**
All the matches are judged by Hundred Personas.
All the matches are witnessed by Hundred Personas.

 
**Hundred Personas**
We are all one. So, even if someone tickles an opponent's arm, or maybe sticks out a foot to trip a runner in a race...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Those are all just methods we might employ to win the competition.

 
**Hundred Personas**
It is neither cheating nor intervention from an outside party. We are, after all, doing these things ourselves.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-I-I see...?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
Then let us go, Master.
Help me help myself!

 
**Mash**
This gets more confusing the more you think about it.

 
**Mash**
So many Hassans, all part of the same one...this must be what gestaltzerfall is like...


**--BATTLE--**

**Hundred Personas**
(Pant...pant...)

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Ah!
We lost! We lost!

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
The moment he started using both arms, I shoulda realized it was a battle royale, not an arm wrestling match!

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Why the hell didn't I watch out for someone creeping up from behind!

 
**Beowulf**
Tsk. If only I had one more arm. What, you don't think I could just GROW one from sheer willpower alone?

 
**Atalante**
This wasn't a footrace. It was an obstacle course.
I should have paid closer attention to the rules.

 
**Nero**
Ungh. Those unpredictable, unexpected motions of yours are well beyond ordinary! If you'd lived in my time, I would have hired you as a court dancer!

 
**Mata Hari**
Yes, indeed. I'm sure you would have been in great demand at every inn.

 
**Zayed the Base**
...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Now, tell us.
Tell us everything you know.

 
**Hundred Personas**
If you know anything about her movements...anything that could give us even a clue...tell us.

 
**Hundred Personas**
...We see. If we put everything we have learned together and consider it, we could best summarize it by saying...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Something fishy is going on with the kids lately.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The children of Chaldea...?


---
 
**Mash**
Do you think that's true, Hundred Personas?

 
**Hundred Personas**
It could be possible.
It doesn't seem that far-fetched of a reason for this.

 
**Mash**
Reason...?

 
**Hundred Personas**
Either way, we have some clues now.
Let's go see the children!


**--ARROW--**

**Hundred Personas**
Here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's just knock...


---
 
**Nursery Rhyme's Voice**
Oh, a woodpecker is singing “knock, knock.”
We have visitors. Visitors!

 
**Jack's Voice**
Yes? Who's there?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Fujimaru.


---
 
**Jack's Voice**
Master?
Anybody else with you?

 
**Mash**
Yes. Me and Hundred Personas.
May we come in?

 
**Nursery Rhyme's Voice**
...No.

 
**Mash**
Huh?

 
**Nursery Rhyme's Voice**
No means no!

 
**Jack's Voice**
If it's just Mommy and Mash...no.
Nobody can come in.

 
**Nursery Rhyme's Voice**
Yep, yep.
Nobody can absolutely come in!

 
**Hundred Personas**
Ah, results at last.
Now if I may...

 
**Mash**
Oh wait, Hundred Personas!

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Grr! I told you, you can't come in!

 
**Jack**
I said so...

 
**Mash**
That's...?

 
**Hundred Personas**
Ah. So you were here all along.

 
**???**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So this girl is the one you were looking for?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
...Yes. We're embarrassed to say so,
but that is the me that we were looking for.

 
**Hundred Personas**
That's another of the Hundred Personas.
Yes, she is another of our personalities.

 
**Mash**
B-but she seems a little different than the rest of the Hundred Personas.

 
**Mash**
Excuse me for saying this, but she doesn't seem much like a Hassan OR an Assassin...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Of course not. The specialty of that persona is not knowing or being able to do anything.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What does that mean...?


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
To know nothing can sometimes be very useful for an assassin.

 
**Hundred Personas**
This would be utterly humiliating if it actually happened, but...hypothetically, let's say we failed a mission and the enemy captured us.

 
**Hundred Personas**
If we had a persona that knows nothing, then no matter how much they were interrogated, they could not reveal anything, because they do not KNOW anything.

 
**Mash**
That's terrible!
A personality to use only under interrogation!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
How terrible! Bad!
To treat such a cute little girl that way!

 
**Jack**
We found her wandering the hallway and heard her story. That's why we brought her here.

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
That's right. You shouldn't have to do something you don't want to! You shouldn't have to be trapped by a boring and painful fate!

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
That's a book you should just leave closed.
That's why we decided to let her stay here.

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Here, her only job is to enjoy drinking tea and chatting.

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
...She doesn't talk much, but she is so cute when she eats snacks! Like a little squirrel!

 
**Hundred Personas**
I'm grateful you took good care of her until now.
But...

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Are you going to take our friend away?

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Even though there's so many of you already?

 
**Hundred Personas**
No one else can fill her role. There is no changing the fact that she is one of our faces.

 
**Hundred Personas**
We cannot have her stay in here forever.
Now, come. We're going home.

 
**???**
...

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
You can't.
We're not going to let you take our friend!

 
**Jack**
Right. We just got to be friends!
We don't want to say bye-bye yet.

 
**Jack**
We haven't even learned her name.

 
**Hundred Personas**
...I see we have no choice. It appears we must first teach these children to heed their elders!

 
**Mash**
P-please be gentle with them, Hundred Personas!
Let's just calm things down so we can talk!


**--BATTLE--**

**Hundred Personas**
Now that the children have had their spankings...

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
We're not giving in! We won't just do whatever mean thing the adults tell us we have to!

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Don't you hurt our friend!

 
**Mash**
Hundred Personas...um...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Have mercy on them.


---
 
**Hundred Personas**
I cannot believe Mash and Master are looking at us like that...

 
**Hundred Personas**
But, it seems there is still some misunderstanding.
To restate...

 
**Hundred Personas**
...

 
**E：???**
Oh...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Allow us to clarify.

 
**Hundred Personas**
You have no job at Chaldea. You are not in charge of being interrogated. You are just a part of us.

 
**E：???**
...?

 
**Jack**
Not in charge of getting interrogated?

 
**Hundred Personas**
Of course not.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Matters would be different if we were exclusively assassins as we were in life. But now we are Master's Servant.

 
**Hundred Personas**
There is no situation in which we would be captured.

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Then...why were you trying to take them back?

 
**Hundred Personas**
Since we were summoned, this persona never showed her face. Not once.

 
**Hundred Personas**
This one is still an important part of us.
We&ndash;all of us&ndash;were simply worried about her.

 
**E：???**
Worried?

 
**Hundred Personas**
That's right. Gozul, Makul, Zayed...everyone's looking for you. You should at least put in an appearance so everyone can stop worrying.

 
**Hundred Personas**
And after that...if you want to come back to your new friends and play, you may do as you like.

 
**Hundred Personas**
They're also Master's Servants. Spending time interacting with others is a good thing.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hm. Perhaps that is your new role here.

 
**Hundred Personas**
After all, I'm too embarrassed to join in tea parties like this one.

 
**E：???**
...'Kay.
Then I'll go back.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Yes, let's go back.

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
Oh.
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
If she isn't going to get harmed, and if the people at home are worried, then obviously she should go home once in a while.

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
You just need to come here whenever you want to have a tea party!

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
When you've left all your worries behind, or forgotten them, or just foisted them onto the adults, that's when we have a great, grand tea party!

 
**Nursery Rhyme**
See you again, tiny little Hassan.

 
**Jack**
Bye-bye.

 
**Little Hassan**
...Bye-bye.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I never imagined such a Hassan existed...


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, I'm as surprised as you are.
She was so tiny and cute.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Surprised?
That's actually our line.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
?

**Hundred Personas**
While we are a conglomerate, we are individuals. We do not, however, have any sort of connection that would allow us to communicate mentally.

 
**Hundred Personas**
That's why it took all of us,
and so much effort, to find her.

 
**Hundred Personas**
And that is why she also didn't know who you are or what your purpose is.

 
**Hundred Personas**
And that's probably why she didn't want to leave the children's room.

 
**Mash**
...I see.

 
**Mash**
So this all happened because she didn't know what sort of Master Senpai is.

 
**Little Hassan**
...

 
**Mash**
Hehe... As a Servant who has spent a lot of time contracted with Master, I can tell you this much:

 
**Mash**
As long as we are here,
we won't ever let you get hurt. Absolutely not.

 
**Mash**
And like the other Hundred Personas, you won't have to do the sort of dirty jobs you did in the past.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Sheesh. I'm quite astonished.
To be honest, I am appalled.

 
**Hundred Personas**
Even though we are a Servant best suited for that kind of dirty work, Master has never once ordered us to do anything of the sort.

 
**Hundred Personas**
And the fact that we know with certainty that Master would never issue such orders...

 
**Hundred Personas**
Hmph. You are a strange, strange [♂ man /♀️ woman}, Master.

You think so?

**Mash**
(Even though it's impossible to tell with that mask on...I have a feeling she's smiling as she says that. I can tell from her tone of voice.)

 
**Mash**
It's like we just found a new friend here in Chaldea.

 
**Mash**
We should introduce her to the other Hundred Personas, as well as to the other Servants. Oh, and we should give her a tour of Chaldea, too.

 
**Mash**
Um, Little Hassan.
Is there anywhere you would like to go?

 
**Little Hassan**
... (Nod)

 
**Mash**
Where? I can take you anywhere.
Please do not hesitate to ask!

 
**Little Hassan**
...

 
**Little Hassan**
Potty.

 
**Mash**
!!!

 
**Hundred Personas**
Ah! Okay! That's our first priority!
But hold it a little longer, okay?

 
**Little Hassan**
... (Nod)
