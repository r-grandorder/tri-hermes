**Boudica**
...Hmm?
What is it?

 
**Boudica**
Oh, sorry. Was I humming? It's been so long since I've walked through my home forest.

 
**Boudica**
I just, you know?
I was just enjoying myself.

 
**Boudica**
Anyway, Fujimaru, are you okay?
We've been walking a long way. Are you tired?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine.
 
**Boudica**
I see. Okay.
Glad you're doing well!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about you? You okay?
 
**Boudica**
Hahaha, I'm a Servant!
I've got tons of stamina.

**Mash**
Oh...

 
**Mash**
(That's what I always say, but today she said it first&ndash;)

 
**Mash**
(N-No, it doesn't matter. It's not important.)

 
**Fou**
Fou?

 
**Mash**
Yes, what is it, Fou?
Why are you rubbing against me?

 
**Fou**
Fou, fo, foou.
Kyuu!

 
**Dr. Roman**
I think Fou's trying to make you feel better.
Boudica's like everyone's big sister.

 
**Dr. Roman**
So Fujimaru ends up being like her little [♂ brother /♀️ sister}. Yup, yup.

 
**Dr. Roman**
And that means Mash is going to feel lonely.
&ndash;That's what Fou's saying, I think.

 
**Fou**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Mash**
...Thank you, Fou.
But don't worry about me.

 
**Mash**
Both Boudica and I are Master's Servants.

 
**Mash**
I don't feel lonely&ndash;
Not at all.

 
**Mash**
It actually makes me feel better to have more people looking out for Master.

 
**Fou**
Fou?

 
**Boudica**
Oh, right.
Before we rayshifted...

 
**Boudica**
I used the kitchen in the Chaldea living quarters to make us some lunch.

 
**Boudica**
If you're hungry, would you like to have some?

 
**Boudica**
I tried making Japanese rice balls.
It's my first time, so I don't know if they'll be good&ndash;

 
**Boudica**
But if you're hungry, how about it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I am feeling hungry.
 


---
 
**Boudica**
Really? Great!
Okay&ndash;let's take a break here.

 
**Boudica**
Hey, Mash, how about it?
Can we rest?

 
**Mash**
Oh, yes. It should be safe.
We need to give Senpai a chance to rest, too.

 
**Boudica**
Hooray♪ Let's eat, then!
I think we could rest by that grass over there, right?

 
**Fou**
Foou!

 
**Mash**
That's right.
We won't need to lay down a blanket then&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'm jealous you guys get to have a picnic!
I'm eating by myself...wait!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Multiple magical energy signature detected!
We may have found our target!

 
**Boudica**
Oh, jeez!
I was looking forward a good relaxation in the forest.

 
**Boudica**
These nasty little goblins are interrupting just when it's getting good!

 
**Mash**
Multiple packs coming from the front, Master!
Be careful.

 
**???**
...Heheh.
Yummy woman...yummy...hahaha.

 
**???**
Kill the men...
Take the women back to the nest, heheh.

 
**Dr. Roman**
!!

 
**Fou**
!!!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Delicious-looking women? ...O-Oh no!
I heard the ancient Celtic goblins were primitive!

 
**Dr. Roman**
But this goes beyond primitive, and sounds like they're planning something weird!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
B-But are they?
Are they planning something weird!?

 
**Fou**
Fo, foou!?

 
**Mash**
Doctor? Fou, too...?
Why are you so agitated?

 
**Boudica**
Not only have you interrupted our rest, you have defiled the forests of Britannia&ndash;

 
**Boudica**
I was planning on resting Fujimaru on my lap and give the Master a much needed pampering&ndash;

 
**Mash**
Huh?

 
**Boudica**
I don't know if it's the Grail's influence, but these goblins have grown bigger than usual!

 
**Boudica**
I remember normal goblins being a little bit smaller than this!

 
**Boudica**
You weird goblins, I will never&ndash;

 
**Boudica**
Ever, lose to you!

 
**Dr. Roman**
!!

 
**Fou**
!!!

 
**???**
!!!!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Huh? Y-You're not doing that on purpose, right!?
Boudica, that's what people say when they lose&ndash;

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Boudica**
Huh?
What?

 
**Mash**
Doctor, what are you saying?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
L-Let's just fight!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We will never lose!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Right, Master!
Commencing combat!


**--BATTLE--**

**Dr. Roman**
"...Damn it..."

 
**Dr. Roman**
"...You captured us girls..."

 
**Dr. Roman**
"...And took us here...
What are you going to do to us..."

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hehehehe, just what you think!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hehehehe, you'll find out soon!
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
"...O-Oh no..."

 
**Dr. Roman**
"...Sob... I-If you're going to do that to us, I'd rather you just..."

 
**Mash**
Doctor, Senpai, what are you doing?

 
**Mash**
First you ordered a panting Boudica to
"Look down, embarrassed," during battle...

 
**Mash**
...and then you started saying this weird stuff...
Why? What's the meaning of this?

 
**Dr. Roman**
No, hahaha! It's nothing!
I just wanted to try it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I couldn't help myself.
 


---
 
**Boudica**
Hahaha, I had fun!
Anyway&ndash;

 
**Boudica**
Thanks for coming with me, guys. We wiped out those bad goblins from my home's forests.

 
**Boudica**
When you fixed Nero's era, I got a bad feeling.

 
**Boudica**
So I came here to check it out, and sure enough, I was right.

 
**Mash**
I believed in you.
I knew your intuition was correct.

 
**Boudica**
Thanks, Mash. You really are a good girl.
I'll give you something nice later.

 
**Mash**
N-Not really...

 
**Boudica**
But I've never seen goblins swell up like that.
There were so many, and they attacked us.

 
**Boudica**
Forest spirits aren't necessary always like that, you know.

 
**Boudica**
It should be rare to see them at all.
Hmm...

 
**Boudica**
Maybe this is the Grail's doing?
What a mess that thing makes.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, yeah. If you look through the records it causes all kinds of trouble.

 
**Mash**
Is it that easy...
for human wishes to cause disaster?

 
**Mash**
The Grail can grant any wish, so it can easily cause disasters. Which means that maybe...

 
**Mash**
Human wishes themselves often bring disaster.
That's just a theory though&ndash;

 
**Boudica**
Yes.
You might be right.

 
**Boudica**
But I don't think I want to believe that.

 
**Boudica**
Wishes are supposed to be...
They're supposed to be much simpler things.

 
**Boudica**
More humble, and warmer, I think.

 
**Boudica**
For example...

 
**Dr. Roman**
For example?

 
**Fou**
Fou?

 
**Boudica**
Like eating a nice meal with someone you love, maybe.

 
**Boudica**
That's what I mean.
Do you understand&ndash;what I'm saying?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup! Lunchtime!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's get back to that break!
 


---
 
**Boudica**
Hahaha, that's right! Now, sit down.
I'll get the lunches out!

 
**Boudica**
Fujimaru, you sit next to me.
Come on, you too, Mash! You sit next to me, too!

 
**Mash**
R-Right!

 
**Fou**
Fou!
