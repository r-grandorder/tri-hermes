# Nezha

<h2>The Feudists</h2>

**Mash**
Oh, Senpai.

 
**Mash**
Yes, I was just reading.

 
**Mash**
I wanted to learn more about Nezha,
so I was re-reading her story.

 
**Mash**
I had read “Journey to the West” before, but I learned of “Investiture of the Gods” only recently.

 
**Mash**
Have you heard of it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Both novels are pretty popular.
 
**Mash**
Really?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think that many people have read the original text...
 
**Mash**
So there are many spin-off works from the original text.

 


---
 
**Mash**
Human culture never ceases to amaze me.

 
**Mash**
The frequently mentioned Chinese classics are: “Journey to the West,” “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” “Water Margin,” and “The Plum in the Golden Vase.”

 
**Mash**
Though many of the passionate readers switch the “Golden Vase” with “Investiture of the Gods” to insist that it is one of the great classic Chinese novels.

 
**Mash**
And some say that the “Investiture of the Gods” is one of the great Chinese classics, along with “Romance of the Three Kingdoms” and “Journey to the West.”

 
**Mash**
I also took a brief look at related Chinese texts...

 
**Mash**
But it appears that the lore for Nezha greatly differs from work to work.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really?
 
**Mash**
It appears that she has Taoist,
Buddhist, and even Hindu origins.

 
**Mash**
Although, that isn't really unique,
even among the Servants we know...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's just one question (read: gender) to clear up.
 
**Mash**
Senpai, here's your coffee. I believe there are certain topics that are best left alone.

 


---
 
**Mash**
The Nezha that we know appears to be the most similar to the version from “Journey to the West”...

 
**Mash**
The Nezha of “Investiture of the Gods” seems like a better fit for a Berserker than a Lancer...

 
**Mash**
But Nezha is...hard to define. So many characteristics and aspects are jumbled together.

 
**Mash**
In “Investiture of the Gods,” many supernatural beings and spirits of various time periods assemble and participate in a bloody melee.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's like Chaldea.
 
**Mash**
If you're likening “Investiture of the Gods” to an all-star battle set during the Ming Dynasty, you would not be far off the mark.

 
**Mash**
Though, I would prefer to not use the word “melee”...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Both Heroic Spirits and humans have hidden sides.
 
**Mash**
True...it's not right to judge others by rumors or titles alone.

 


---
 
**Mash**
On one hand, Nezha is enshrined as a god in China and Southeast Asia, even in modern times.

 
**Mash**
Don't you think it's odd for a god to be depicted as a youth?

 
**Mash**
I was very curious about that,
and that's why I went to the library...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why don't we just ask Nezha?
 
**Mash**
Wouldn't...that be too...bold of us?

 
**Mash**
With so many aspects, maybe there are some she would prefer be left alone? Still...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Long have I awaited this day...
 
**Mash**
...Senpai.

 
**Mash**
This is that legendary drink called “coffee.”
It's black, so please drink it all down.

 


---
 
**Mash**
Everyone is my teacher in life,
and they are also my friends...

 
**Mash**
Even were it necessary for a mission,
I'd like to avoid anything that could hurt them...

 
**Mash**
Though...my curiosity may be winning out over all that...

 
**Mash**
Um...Nezha's schedule for today is...

 
**Mash**
It appears that she is participating in a meeting run by the “Buddhist Club.”

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's new. Where do they meet?
 
**Mash**
This is the first I heard of the group, as well.

 
**Mash**
I've heard of groups like “Old Men Seriously Reading Fairytales” and “Air Basketball Club”...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How do you know about this club?
 
**Mash**
Because I'm aware of all the clubs that are active in Chaldea!

 
**Mash**
Well...at least I wanted to be.
I may have exaggerated a bit...

 
**Mash**
So actually, an anonymous Japanese Lancer came to me to discuss something, and that's how I heard about it.

 


---
 
**Mash**
The meeting is held...in the simulator room, it seems.

 
**Mash**
I can even hear the sounds of battle all the way out here. I can only assume that an extensive training session is underway.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Forcing my way in.
 
**Mash**
Ah, Senpai!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd like to join the club.
 
**Mash**
If it's a Buddhist Club, would the conditions to join the club be renouncing the world and becoming a monk?

 


---

**--ARROW--**

**Nezha**
Master!
Have. No need. For assistance. Or strategizing.

 
**Nezha**
This is training!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's why I wanted to join.


---
 
**Benkei**
Wonderful, Lord Nezha.
Such superb fighting technique!

 
**Benkei**
My naginata is certainly getting a workout.
Your mystical spear is especially ravishing!

 
**Benkei**
And this is called the Fire-Tipped Spear?

 
**Benkei**
Well, you are more than qualified to join our Buddhist Club!

 
**Nezha**
...??? Do not. Understand.

 
**Nezha**
Buddhist Club? More like. Feudist club!

 
**Nezha**
But. You helped me train...
You were. Enthusiastic. Thank you. For that.

 
**Sanzang**
Huh? When did this turn into a club admission test?

 
**Sanzang**
Actually, we welcome anyone and everyone to our Buddhist gathering.

 
**Sanzang**
But honestly, I was beyond excited when I learned that Nezha had come to Chaldea!

 
**Sanzang**
I'd be happy to spend time with you!
Not just when we're training, either!

 
**Sanzang**
From eating vegetarian sweets, picking out a priest's stole, temple hopping...I'm game for anything!

 
**Nezha**
You just want. Me to indulge. Your desires.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
...Um...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
I'm all for being wrapped in the warm embrace of friends old and new...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
But I do not remember...EVER...joining such a club.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
What I DO remember is being grabbed and dragged in here. Isn't this kidnapping!?

 
**Mash**
...R-really? I was wondering why you were here.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Well, I'm relieved to know that at least SOMEONE is concerned about me!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Oh, but if Master is considering joining, I may be more inclined to do so, too. So, all's well that ends well!

 
**Nezha**
Don't go. Near...Master! Evil fox spirit!!!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
MIKON!?
The end of my poor tail is on fire!

 
**Mash**
Nezha!?
She just used her Fire-Tipped Spear!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're not in the simulator anymore!


---
 
**Benkei**
If I may explain...
Lord Nezha requested a match with Lady Tamamo.

 
**Nezha**
No. Not just a match.
I am going. To kill her. KILL!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
WHAAAT!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
No wonder it felt like you were just going after me!
I don't understand this sudden assault against me!

 
**Mash**
Let me guess...does Nezha see Tamamo as the character from the “Investiture of the Gods”...?

 
**Mash**
That is, the fox spirit, Daji, who is said to have caused the decline of the Shang dynasty!?

 
**Nezha**
Yes! Correct!

 
**Nezha**
She is. The unparalleled trickster. Brutal. Conniving fox! She will. Surely cause. Chaldea's downfall!

 
**Sanzang**
Oh, really?

 
**Sanzang**
So, so...were you also Lady Huangyang from Tianzhu all that time ago? She was pretty foxy, too.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Hmmm...hmmm...
Tamamo doesn't know♡

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
I can neither confirm nor deny such a thing... I'm a little fuzzy when it comes to my past life and stuff...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even so, that has nothing to do with the Tamamo in Chaldea.
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Oh, Master...!

 
**Benkei**
Ah, that's our Master. Your acceptance and generosity toward others is more vast than any ocean!

 
**Sanzang**
Yes! That's my disciple you're talking about!

 
**Sanzang**
But...I will have a word with you later,
Benkei, for starting this whole kerfuffle.

 
**Benkei**
Hmgh!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fight, and whoever wins shall be my consort!
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Mikon!? I heard something just like that in my previous life! Ah, that brings back memories... Now I'm all fired up!

 
**Nezha**
C-consort!?
I-I refuse! Why ME!?

 
**Mash**
That's right, Senpai!
Please do not tease them like that!

 
**Sanzang**
That's right, my disciple! If we're going to do it, it'll have to be fair and square! Like in a tournament!

 
**Nezha**
X-Xuanzang!
You half-witted monk!

 
**Sanzang**
Leaving the consort issue aside...

 


---
 
**Sanzang**
Fated enemies... Such encounters are bound to happen in a place where Servants assemble.

 
**Sanzang**
Nezha's grudge would probably have come up at some point.

 
**Sanzang**
But since she came by seeking help from our club...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
I am not asking for help, not this shrine maiden♡

 
**Sanzang**
Leaving the source of the dispute alone would likely affect future activities for Fujimaru.

 
**Sanzang**
Now, you two...

 
**Sanzang**
Since we have the simulator here, why don't we banish our worldly desires here?

 
**Benkei**
Hm...what are you suggesting?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A one-on-one all-out...battle?


---
 
**Sanzang**
Yep. That's right.

 
**Sanzang**
Personally, I prefer not to believe that Tamamo is a bad Heroic Spirit...

 
**Nezha**
Xuanzang...

 
**Nezha**
That. Is quite. A grand sentiment.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
...One-on-one!? (Ears twitching)

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
...Teehee. That's the spirit.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
You started this, so you won't mind if I hit back full-force, right?

 
**Mash**
Tamamo is quite riled up.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Very well. I accept your challenge!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
And then I will assume the position of reliable consort, once and for all! Please watch, Master☆

 
**Nezha**
I thought. We dropped. The idea.
Of becoming. Master's consort?

 
**Nezha**
!!!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Now, this will be a fair and square one-on-one fight! And your opponent will be ME!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Don't you dare say you've never seen anything like this in Chaldea! Just come at me!

 
**Nezha**
Body clones!? Divided Spirits!?
Oh, yes!

 
**Nezha**
Even I. Know. Three-faced. Six-armed. Battle techniques. I shall. Be your. Greatest Opponent!


**--BATTLE--**

**Nezha**
I won! It is my! Victory!

 
**Nezha**
Even if. The evil. Fox spirit. Goes mad.
Everything should. Be fine. Since I. Am here!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
I...lost...unnnghhh... The path to becoming the perfect Servant...cannot be walked in a single day...

 
**Benkei**
But it was a grand battle.

 
**Sanzang**
You think so? I think Nezha needs more training.

 
**Sanzang**
Growing is good, especially for Nezha,
who will always remain in her childhood form.

 
**Nezha**
I once. Sealed away. Ninety-six demons.
So three. Or even. A hundred. Demons&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you, Nezha.
 
**Nezha**
Oh...Master...

 
**Nezha**
Okay! Got it!

 
**Nezha**
I will focus. And work. My hardest!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for holding back, Tamamo.
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
Master... Of course...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae**
As the shrine maiden with a permanent spot reserved at Master's side, it's the least I can do☆

 


---
 
**Mash**
So it appears that Nezha not only possesses memories from “Journey to the West,” but also from the “Investiture of the Gods.”

 
**Nezha**
Yes. That is. Just another. Part of. My past.

 
**Nezha**
The “me.” From then. Always sought. New enemies.
And I was. Violent... Dangerous...

 
**Nezha**
I was. Like...a Berserker. I had. No right.
To bad-mouth. The Great Sage. Heaven's Equal.

 
**Mash**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What kind of person do you want to be now, Nezha?


---
 
**Nezha**
Master...

 
**Nezha**
I...I...honestly...

 
**Nezha**
Rather than. A strong god. Of martial arts. I want to be. A good god. One who. Is kind. To children.

 
**Nezha**
I hated. And cursed. My parents. Especially Father.

 
**Nezha**
Even now. Even with. My soul. Wandering so. The flame. Within me. Has yet. To be. Fully extinguished.

 
**Nezha**
And so. I wish. To cherish. The young. I want. To Protect. Children. And save them. From going through. What I. Once did...

 
**Nezha**
My desires...may not. Match up.
With other. Strong people's...

 
**Nezha**
They may. Not fit. A Servant. Of Chaldea...

 
**Mash**
No! That's not true, Nezha.

 
**Mash**
We welcome Nezha with open arms!
Right, Senpai!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There is strength in kindness.


---
 
**Nezha**
...I see.
Then...I'm relieved. Master...thank you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, by the way...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's something I've been curious about...


---
 
**Mash**
...Senpai...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's a subject we haven't addressed...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Take a look at this list, and tell me which one you identify with...


---
 
**Nezha**
...Hm?

 
**Nezha**
“Male,” “Female,” “Both,” “None,” “Beep-boop,” “Astrodroid,” “Non-binary”...

 
**Nezha**
...HMMMMMMMMMMM!?

 
**Nezha**
NO, Master! Understand that. There are. Some topics. That I. Do not. Wish to. Talk about. Even at. My Master's. Earnest request!

 
**Mash**
...Senpai! Please have this scalding hot cup of coffee!!!
