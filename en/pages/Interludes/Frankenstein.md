# Frankenstein

<h2>The Events of a Lonely Night in November I</h2>

**Fran**
...
...

 
**Mash**
Fran, are you all right?

 
**Fran**
...Uh.

 
**Mash**
There's another artificial human like Fran in this era...
Was Chaldea's analysis really correct?

 
**Mash**
We're a long way from both London,
and Victor Frankenstein's house...

 
**Fran**
Uuuh...

 
**Mash**
Fran doesn't seem to know either...
But let's look anyway.

 
**Mash**
Oh, Fran.
Wake Master up, please.

 
**Mash**
I'll go look around and then meet up with you both.

 
**Fran**
Uuh!

 
**Mash**
...Everything seems normal.
Okay, now to meet up with Master&ndash;

 
**Mash**
W-What happened here&ndash;!?

 
**Fran**
...Uuhh!

 
**Mash**
Um... Master didn't get up,
so you were worried it was a terrible illness.

 
**Mash**
Then you decided to give electroshock therapy,
and fired off Blasted Tree... Right?

 
**Mash**
...
...

 
**Mash**
Isn't that a really bad idea&ndash;!?

 
**Fran**
Uuh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I thought I was done for.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My life flashed before my eyes...
 


---
 
**Mash**
I'm glad you're alive.

 
**Fran**
Uh...

 
**Mash**
It's okay, Fran.
Master isn't mad.

 
**Fran**
Uuh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's right. I'm not.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful from now on.
 


---
 
**Fran**
Uuuuuuh...

 
**Mash**
Looks like she understands.

 
**Mash**
Doctor, we're almost at our destination.
See any responses?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hmm... That's strange.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I momentarily detected strong magical energy just now,
but it's already gone.

 
**Dr. Roman**
There's traces left, but they're starting to vanish.
By the time you get there they'll be gone.

 
**Mash**
Some kind of summoning ritual?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'm not sure... I don't have enough to say either way.
I don't see enemy bio-responses, so don't worry.

 
**Fran**
...Uuh? Uuuuuhh...

 
**Mash**
Fran, what's wrong?
...You saw something strange over there, you say?

 
**Mash**
This is... Something was buried here.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Let's take a look.

 
**Fran**
Uuuuuhh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is there something here?
 


---
 
**Fran**
Uuh, uh.

 
**Mash**
Under the ground?

 
**Mash**
What...? A voice!?

 
**Fran**
Uuuuuhhhhhh!

 
**Dr. Roman**
W-Wait!
You shouldn't dig there! Bad idea!

 
**Mash**
Doctor, what's down there!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's a human corpse!

 
**Fran**
...!?

 
**Mash**
It's not human... It's a homunculus?
And...it's still alive!

 
**Fran**
Uuuh&mdash;!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It was dead just a moment ago,
with no trace of magical energy at all!

 
**Mash**
Master, let's fight!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
...Whew.
Bio-response has disappeared.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I can confirm that here, too. Whew, that scared me...

 
**Fran**
Uuuuh...

 
**Mash**
Fran?
...You want us to investigate the homunculus?

 
**Fran**
Uh.

 
**Mash**
Doctor, can you analyze it?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah, it'll take a little time, but...
I'll get started.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh, and that powerful magical energy I detected?
I saw something similar in the fortress up ahead.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I'd like you to go after it immediately.
That homunculus suggests something bad is going on.

 
**Mash**
Roger.
We'll head there now.

 
**Fran**
...Uuhhh.

 
**Mash**
Fran, calm down please.
&ndash;There's nobody here, huh?

 
**Mash**
I don't sense anybody here either.
...This might be worse than we thought.

 
**Fran**
Uuuuh... Uuuhh!

 
**Mash**
Fran!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's follow her!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's catch her!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Right!
Fran, wait!

 
**Fran**
...Uuh!

 
**???**
&ndash;There you...are... My defective...big sister.

 
**Fran**
!?!?!?

 
**???**
You have...a funny look...on your...face.
Or...have you...never...seen...your face...in a mirror?

 
**Mash**
Fran, you're going too fast...
Huh!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The same face?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Another Fran?
 


---
 
**Fran(?)**
So that's...your new...Master...huh?
Your morals...are defective...as well...then.

 
**Fran(?)**
&ndash;When our Master...abandons us...we die.
That is...our rule...right?

 
**Fran(?)**
But you...became...a Heroic Spirit.
And swore...loyalty to a...new Master.

 
**Fran(?)**
Defective...to the core...

 
**Fran**
Uuuh!

 
**Fran(?)**
Oh...I see.
You can't talk...my poor...Big Sister!

 
**Fran(?)**
I can talk...like this!
And Father...loves...me!

 
**Fran(?)**
I'm different...than you...in every...way!

 
**Mash**
Who are you? And what did you do to the people in this fortress?

 
**Fran(?)**
Stupid...human.
You don't really...expect me...to answer that!?

 
**Mash**
No, the answer is clear.
&ndash;You killed everyone in this fortress.

 
**Fran(?)**
Hehehe.
Wrong.

 
**Fran(?)**
I...did not...kill them.
I...gave...them...new...life.

 
**Mash**
Huh!?

 
**Mash**
It can't be!

 
**Dr. Roman**
I've got it! That homunculus was made using human parts!

 
**Dr. Roman**
As you know, homunculi are created using magical circuits as a base&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
But she's using magical energy to power corpses instead.

 
**Dr. Roman**
They're less like homunculi, and more like Fran...
Closer to artificial humans!

 
**Fran(?)**
Ahahahaha!
Let's start...with a warm-up.

 
**Fran(?)**
Try your best... Big Sister.

 
**Mash**
...They're coming!
Fran, get ready!

 
**Fran**
Uuh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fran!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Calm down!
 


---
 
**Fran**
...
...(Nod nod)

 
**Fran**
GGNNNAAAAAOOOOOHH!


**--BATTLE--**

**Fran(?)**
&ndash;Hmph. I...expected...as much.
Fine. I'll...fight you...myself.

 
**Fran(?)**
You will be...a good...test case.
I am...not yet...complete.

 
**Fran(?)**
But...if I...can defeat...Big Sister.
I know...I will...become&ndash;complete.

 
**Fran(?)**
Here...I...go!

 
**Fran**
SSHA&mdash;AHHH!


**--BATTLE--**

**Fran(?)**
Ugh!?
No...you can't...be this...strong!

 
**???**
&ndash;Come home.

 
**Fran(?)**
...Father!?

 
**Fran**
!!!

 
**???**
We have sufficient samples.
It's time to go.

 
**???**
Don't worry.
You will become perfect. I promise.

 
**Fran(?)**
...I under...stand.

 
**Mash**
I won't let you get away!

 
**Fran(?)**
&ndash;"Blasted Tree!"

 
**Mash**
Ugh!

 
**Fran**
...Uuuh!

 
**Fran(?)**
Farewell...Big Sister.
Next time...we meet...will probably...be...goodbye.

 
**Fran**
...Uh.

 
**Mash**
She got away!
Doctor!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's no good. There's no traces of magical energy left.
...And what's more.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I just realized this, but the traces of magical energy in the fortress were a trap...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yup, there's nothing left.
It's impossible to track them. I'm sorry...

 
**Dr. Roman**
I did get her data, though.
Next time she shows up, I can track her... I think.

 
**Fran**
Uuhhh!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll get her next time!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yeah.
We have to get stronger, too...

 
**Fran**
...Uuuhh. (Nod Nod)


<h2>The Events of a Lonely Night in November II</h2>

**Fran**
...Uh.

 
**Mash**
Fran, are you okay?

 
**Fran**
Uh, uh.

 
**Mash**
If you say so.

 
**Mash**
Doctor, are you sure you detected&ndash;the other Fran at this location?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah. I've been keeping a monitor running in the background since last time.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I caught nothing for a long time,
and then suddenly I saw something.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I think it's her little sister.

 
**Fran**
...Uh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's not your little sister?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's an enemy?
 


---
 
**Fran**
Uh.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...I guess that's true.
We'll call her E. Fran, then.

 
**Dr. Roman**
The "E" is for Enemy.
That works perfectly, right?

 
**Fran**
Uuh...uh.

 
**Mash**
She seems extremely reluctant, but agrees.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I-I see.
Then start by heading to that town over there.

 
**Dr. Roman**
But be careful.
I'm not seeing any life signs in that town.

 
**Mash**
Does that mean...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah, it's been destroyed.

 
**Fran**
...Uh...

 
**Mash**
Yeah... It's just like before.
There's no one around.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Detecting magical energy.
...Probably more homunculi.

 
**Dr. Roman**
That's several of them. Be careful!

 
**Fran**
Uuuuuhh&mdash;Ghaaannoohh!

 
**Mash**
Don't worry, Master.
We can beat them easily!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
Battle complete.
...As expected, these were made from corpses as well.

 
**???**
...Correct.
But they were of great use nonetheless.

 
**Fran**
Uh!?

 
**???**
It's been a long time.

 
**???**
I'm surprised you've become a Heroic Spirit.
You, a nameless creature who simply stole my name.

 
**Dr. Roman**
It was him... I knew it!

 
**Mash**
&ndash;Victor Frankenstein!

 
**Fran**
Uuh...

 
**Victor**
Indeed.

 
**Victor**
You became a Servant,
and I became a ghost.

 
**Victor**
But all the changes taking place in the world...
It seems they have created the perfect environment for me.

 
**Victor**
I am but a ghost. A remnant of the past.
I am nothing more, and yet&ndash;

 
**Victor**
With a strong enough will, I can do it again.
I can start over.

 
**Victor**
That miracle! That once-in-a-lifetime chance God gave me! It is mine once more!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Perhaps due to the Singularities...
Even relatively stable eras are starting to waver.

 
**Mash**
In other words, the “If Victor Frankenstein had lived...” hypothesis is being put to the test.

 
**Mash**
Even if he can't change the world,
he can murder an entire town.

 
**E. Fran**
Father.
That's...enough...right?

 
**Victor**
Yes, of course, “Eve.”

 
**Fran**
!!!

 
**Victor**
Kill her.

 
**Victor**
If you do, you can take her place&ndash;
and become a new legend.

 
**Victor**
Eve. The first woman, the mate of Adam. You'll become what can be called a perfect version of her.

 
**E. Fran**
Yes...yes...yes!
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll kill Big Sister! I will! I will!

 
**Fran**
...Uh.

 
**Victor**
You can't even speak?
What a failure you are&ndash;

 
**Fran**
Shut...up.

 
**Victor**
?!?!?!

 
**Fran**
Talking...is...tiring.
But... I'll...say...this.

 
**Fran**
Father. Little Sister.
You...ended...long ago.

 
**Fran**
I...find...my...own...husband.
I...pick...my...own...name.

 
**Fran**
So.
Come...with me!

 
**Victor**
You little&ndash;!

 
**E. Fran**
Shut up!

 
**Mash**
...Fran!
We'll fight with you!

 
**Fran**
...Yes.
Together!


**--BATTLE--**

**Fran**
Hah... Hah... Hah!

 
**E. Fran**
Ugh... Why! How!
This...can't be! You! Big Sister!

 
**E. Fran**
You can't...be this...strong!

 
**Fran**
GGNNAAAAOOOH!

 
**E. Fran**
Eek!

 
**E. Fran**
Gaah!?

 
**Victor**
...Oh, brother.

 
**E. Fran**
Fa-ther. Fat-her. Fath-er.
No...no...no! Strong...strong...strong!

 
**Victor**
Don't worry, “Eve.”
I never expected anything of you to begin with.

 
**E. Fran**
&ndash;Huh?

 
**Victor**
After all, the defect is in the soul used as the base.

 
**Victor**
It's probably because you're not created from magical circuits like the homunculi.

 
**Victor**
A degraded soul is inferior to a human.
It can't possibly defeat a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Victor**
There's only one reason I created you.

 
**E. Fran**
Fath-er?

 
**Fran**
!?!?!?

 
**Mash**
Wha&ndash;!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
What? What's going on!?

 
**Mash**
Victor Frankenstein...killed E. Fran!

 
**E. Fran**
W-Why?
I...did...everything...for you...

 
**Victor**
I know.
But&ndash;in the end, you're defective.

 
**Victor**
And so am I, as a human.
So I'm taking your body.

 
**Victor**
My soul. My knowledge. My mind.
Your body. Your abilities.

 
**Victor**
Only together can we attain “Eve.” The gender change will be a bit difficult&ndash;but it's nothing to worry about.

 
**E. Fran**
No...I don't want that...why...no...no...no...
I don't...want...to become...Father!

 
**E. Fran**
I just...wanted...Father to...compliment...me!

 
**Fran**
...

 
**Victor**
...Now, let's continue.
This “Eve” will be a little different.

 
**Victor**
Come forth, Shadows.

 
**Mash**
Shadow Servants!
He can summon those things?

 
**Victor**
Of course. This is my world. My era. My home.
You're the outsiders.

 
**Victor**
I've removed limiters from “Eve,” as well.
It's time to test my unrivaled power!

 
**Mash**
...This may be only a tiny crack in history.
But we can't just ignore it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Agreed.
 


---
 
**Fran**
...Uuuuh!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fran, defeat him.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fran, avenge your sister.
 


---
 
**Fran**
Under-stood.

 
**Fran**
&ndash;GNAAAAAAAOOOH!


**--BATTLE--**

**Victor**
No... This can't be. There must be some mistake.
I was given life by a miracle.

 
**Victor**
If so, my second coming was to create my own miracle, no? Right? Right, that's how it should be...

 
**Fran**
...No. You...just...by chance...were there.

 
**Victor**
Don't be stupid!
...How could you lie like that!

 
**Fran**
You...only...needed...to...live.
With...someone...you...love.

 
**Fran**
Then...we...might...never...meet...again.

 
**Victor**
No. That's a lie. You're a liar. I was chosen.

 
**Victor**
I am a great Singularity...chosen by this era...
and meant to change history&ndash;

 
**Victor**
...Or is that...wrong?
...

 
**Mash**
All right, that does it for the graves.
Let's offer them a prayer.

 
**Mash**
...If Jeanne and the others were here, they could do a real service.

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Fran**
...Uh.

 
**Fran**
Mast-er.
Let's...go.

 
**Fran**
Saving...eras...the...world.
...I...will...try.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Fran.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm counting on you, Fran.
 


---
 
**Fran**
...Yeah!
