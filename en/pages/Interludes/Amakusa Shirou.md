# Amakusa Shirou

<h2>Let's Talk About Saving the World</h2>

**Narration:**
The act of saving someone is arrogant by nature.

 
**Narration:**
But unless one accepts that arrogance, one cannot hope to help others.

 
**Narration:**
Saving someone is a simple act.
One simply needs to sincerely care about others.

 
**Narration:**
But then, what about saving the world?

 
**Narration:**
I thought I understood what that involved, but perhaps I do not have the answer at all.

 
**Narration:**
What's necessary is uncompromisable power.

 
**Narration:**
The power of salvation that would equally save, with ruthless efficiency, everything in this world.

 
**Narration:**
Of course, I answered this summon for the purpose of saving humanity.

 
**Narration:**
But somewhere in my heart I'm searching for that power.

 
**Narration:**
...That's right. The ruthless salvation that is the Holy Grail.

 
**Mash**
...Take this!

 
**Mash**
Enemies eliminated. Good work.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Understood. Please keep moving forward.

 
**Dr. Roman**
After the Incineration of Humanity, we can't ignore even a small Singularity.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I know you're busy, but destroying them when they're small is much more effective.

 
**Mash**
Yes, both Master and I agree.

 
**Mash**
This time, Amakusa is helping us, so we should be fine.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Please think nothing of it. A Servant that only speaks in irony would have been finished long ago.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Make full use of me.

 
**Mash**
Doctor, are we going the right way?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Of course. Once you're through that forest you'll find a cave.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's hurry!
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Please calm down, Master.
Easy does it.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Patience is important as well.
I've been patient for 60 years, so I can be sure of it.

 
**Mash**
...60 years?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's take it easy.
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
That's the right answer, Master.
Hurrying won't lead to good results.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Especially in this unknown forest. We should be cautious since we don't know what lives here.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
I've been meaning to ask.
Amakusa, why do you use Black Keys?

 
**Dr. Roman**
They didn't exist in the place and time you were alive in, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The black what?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Black Keys?


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
They're the Holy Church's Craft Essence. I don't know the details, but it's some kind of ranged weapon that uses Bible fragments.

 
**Dr. Roman**
There's no record of you belonging to the Holy Church, and that technology hadn't been imported into Japan at that time...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh, it's simple.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I incarnated during a certain Holy Grail War, then joined the Holy Church after.

 
**Mash**
Wha&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman**
You what!?

 
**Mash**
You incarnated...? There are records of some Servants have been incarnated through the power of the Grail, but...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But what I just described contradicts the records in this world. Perhaps what I went through was some occurrence brought forth by an impossible process.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Even so, this form is without a doubt my most useful form as a Servant.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Normally, I am a third-rate Servant who can't even become a Ruler.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
The best I could possibly hope for is to be a Caster.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe you could get Medea to teach you?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hahahaha.
No way. I'd die.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Mages from the Age of Gods are like... Well, if they are a motorcycle, modern mages like us would be regular bicycles.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Besides, I'm probably more of a simple spellcaster.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I don't treat magecraft as something mystical.
To me, it's just useful.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Well, it seems like there are other Servants who feel the same way.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe you could get Edison to teach you?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Edison, huh...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...
...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I just got an epiphany where a “Shin Amakusa Shirou,” conceptually improved with Rocket Arms, is revealed...

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
But if you don't have the right to be summoned as a Ruler, how can you appear as a Ruler now?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh, it's simple.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Because, in the Holy Grail War where I was incarnated, my Master broke the rules.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Normally Rulers are an eighth class. Their role is to mediate the Holy Grail War; their Master is the Grail itself.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It is a Ruler's duty to remain neutral.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...But my Master ignored all that and tried to summon one directly. Master wanted to win the war, see.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
A normal Ruler, summoned during a regular Holy Grail War, possesses Command Spells that affect all participating Servants.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Spells so powerful they can even be used to order Servants to commit suicide.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
As such, making a Ruler into a familiar would, in my Master's eyes, guarantee victory in the war.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...And so that's what my Master did&ndash;with me. My summoning as a Ruler was a violation of the rules. It shouldn't have happened.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...But because it did, I was able to be summoned as a Ruler from there on out. I suppose I gained that right.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Of course, unless it's an urgent matter such as restoring humanity, it's almost impossible to summon me...

 
**Dr. Roman**
I see.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...So you weren't summoned as a Ruler because you naturally had the right.

 
**Dr. Roman**
You were summoned as one because there was a precedence from some other time.

 
**Dr. Roman**
So then if that is the story, regardless to the particulars, it established a pathway to call you in this form again.

 
**Dr. Roman**
The second summoning was probably much easier.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I couldn't win the Holy Grail War I participated in, but through a series of coincidences I gained a physical body.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Oh! It looks like this is not the time to be talking about the past.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oops, I was so invested in the story I stopped paying attention!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Yeah... Incoming enemies! Watch out!

 
**Mash**
Doctor, you're a little late!


**--BATTLE--**

**Amakusa Shirou**
To be honest, I've never performed any miracles.

 
**Mash**
I-Is that so?

 
**Mash**
But legends unmistakably state that Amakusa Shirou performed miracles...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
In that sense... Yes, I performed something magical.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But I did that subconsciously. My own body didn't realize what it was doing.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But faith is a strange thing. After I died and became a Heroic Spirit, I was able to perform miracles.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
By miracles, I mean my original Noble Phantasms, “Right Hand - Evil Eater” and “Left Hand - Xanadu Matrix.”

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm getting an Immortal Chaos Brigade vibe.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes, you have the right idea.

 
**Fou**
Fou!?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hehehe, I do feel a strange sympathy towards Sakata Kintoki and Fuuma Kotarou.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I invited Lu Bu too, but...

 
**Lu Bu**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!!!!

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
I see. That's pretty golden!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou**
Kintoki, what did Lu Bu say?

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Well...

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
“Unfortunately, my Noble Phantasm's name is art, brought to life with strong will and passion. It cannot be changed.”

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Lame!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
So I couldn't get Lu Bu to join.
What a shame.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hahaha. I see Chaldea's Servants are developing some relationships we don't know about.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Something tells me that's no laughing matter... But I suppose it's a good thing if it makes it easier to work together!

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Still, I'm surprised to learn that Amakusa Shirou was a spellcaster.

 
**Dr. Roman**
And by “spellcaster,” I suppose you mean you never actually learned magecraft properly, correct?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes. It was one of those very rare natural occurrences.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I was born with the ability to use magecraft.
However, no one around me could tell its true nature...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
And so I was worshipped as a miracle.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Perhaps Mori Souiken kept the rumors from spreading too far.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
At this point, there's no way to know the truth...

 
**Dr. Roman**
From what you're telling me about your magecraft and its uniqueness, the Mage's Association at the time wouldn't have let you be, no.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
In any case, it was all in the past&ndash;when I was alive. For now, let's focus on saving this world.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you want to save the world?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes. I will save everyone. No matter what atrocities they may have committed.

 
**Mash**
You really are a saint...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
No, I'm not. Besides, I'm not recognized as one by the Church.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I try to be one. However, there are things I must let go of in order to reach that point.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Hatred. As long as I have hatred in my heart, I will never be a saint.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Of course, some people, like Jeanne d'Arc, are basically born saints.

 
**Mash**
Jeanne doesn't seem to think of herself as a saint.

 
**Mash**
I hear people teasing her about that sometimes.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
How she sees herself and how others see her are two different things.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
No matter what she believes, I believe she is a saint.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Of course, she probably wishes I didn't.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Come to think of it, are you related to Jeanne d'Arc somehow?

 
**Dr. Roman**
You're both Rulers, but you don't seem to get along too well.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh, that's...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...I'll keep that a secret.
It has to do with both of our core beliefs.

 
**Fou**
...Fou!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Wait! The Singularity in that cave is rapidly establishing itself!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's fast... What is this!?
Hurry! Something bad is happening!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...!

 
**Mash**
This is...!

 
**Dr. Roman**
A tainted Grail!?
What's this doing here?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Be careful! The black mud coming out of it corrupts Servants!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Hmm.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Calm down, please.
We can just blow it away before it establishes itself.

 
**Mash**
Th-That's true, but...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
With Noble Phantasms, of course.
It will be a race against time, but...

 
**???**
I won't let you do it, Ruler...!
This Grail is mine!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A human...!?
 
**Dr. Roman**
No! That's no human!

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's a remnant of a record, created by the Grail mud!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nurarihyon...!?
 
**Dr. Roman**
No, no. No, no, no.
What would a Japanese monster be doing here?

 
**Dr. Roman**
It's probably the remnants of a record created by the Grail mud.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
...Not exactly a common occurrence, but anyway...!
Just don't hold back against it!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh, it's possible it's someone I fought during the Holy Grail War. But I'm sorry, I don't remember that well.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But if he's here...

 
**???**
You... You want this too, don't you! If this Grail fully forms, it will be a powerful weapon!

 
**???**
One that surpasses the Fuyuki Grail!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Master, let's destroy him.
Talking to him is a waste of time.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Here we go!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
Enemy defeated.
Confirmed elimination.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Whoa, whoa! Hurry! The Pseudo-Grail's like a volcano about to explode!

 
**Dr. Roman**
As soon as it explodes, it will properly establish itself as a Holy Grail.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Activating Noble Phantasm.
Please stand back.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Something else came out of the mud!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
They just keep coming...!

 
**???**
Hey pretty boy.
Is this my first time meeting you? It is, right?

 
**???**
I'm a sewer rat, born from the mud.
I got no business with a saint!

 
**???**
But... I see.
I can see you've led a hard life.

 
**???**
That Heroic Spirit smell you're giving off is pretty damn close to my own!

 
**???**
And that exhaustion you just can't shake? Clear as day! That tired state of mind leaves you open to danger...

 
**???**
...but I guess we can't help it!

 
**???**
You chose to go through all that!
Nobody will sympathize with you!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
You're right. I have no intention of seeking sympathy.
If anything, I am the one who sympathizes with others.

 
**???**
Seriously? Damn, you think just like our new recruit!

 
**???**
An iron will... No, more like the power to get things done, eh? I'm weak to that stuff. In the sense that it makes me want to puke.

 
**???**
So...? My being born means that someone here wants this Grail...

 
**???**
Who is it? Who's the tasteless human?
You?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way.


---
 
**???**
I know, right!?
I mean, didn't think it'd be you!

 
**???**
And it's not that delicious tender-looking Servant over there, either.

 
**Mash**
Tender-looking?

 
**???**
Which leaves... Hey now, saint.

 
**???**
Are you serious about joining our side?
Only bad guys want the Grail. Everyone knows that.

 
**Mash**
Huh...?
A-Amakusa?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hahahaha.
Hey, you're kidding me.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Amakusa?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Don't worry about me.
I know how to deal with Grails.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I will take this Grail and make good use of it.

 
**Dr. Roman**
What... Are you insane!?
That's highly corrupted matter!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Even the resistance power of a Ruler has its limits!

 
**Dr. Roman**
You'll be corrupted instantly!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But even if it means taking risks...
I can't give up on saving the world.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
So I'll try to do so every chance I get.

 
**???**
Wait a minute... You want to use the power of destruction to save the world? You might as well start the doomsday clock right now.

 
**???**
No human, good or evil, can handle the power to save the world.

 
**???**
Right, Master?
Did my words move you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I suppose so.
 
**???**
Right???

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Since when were we friends?
 
**???**
Hey now! You may have a point, but still, that hurts!

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...That mud is right. However, not giving up in the face of adversity is exact what's necessary for salvation.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Master, please decide.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Will you let me take care of this incomplete Grail?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nope.
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...I figured.
Then I'm sorry, but...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Sorry.
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I see.
That leaves me no choice.

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
In that case, let's have ourselves a good old-fashioned Holy Grail War. Winner takes all.

 
**???**
Hahahahaha!
Man, you really are like our new recruit!

 
**???**
Especially the way you'll do whatever it takes!

 
**???**
But our black-caped recruit always puts so much effort into aesthetics.

 
**???**
You're colder, and more efficient. Which makes you impossible to persuade.

 
**???**
Master, you're gonna have to defeat him.

 
**???**
And when a Ruler gets out of hand, what you need is an Avenger to stop them!

 
**???**
Lucky you! You won the chance to try out a rare dark Servant!

 
**???**
I won't last the night anyway.
Might as well die in style!

 
**???**
Let's go, Boss!


**--BATTLE--**

**Amakusa Shirou**
...It seems... I'm the one who lost this fight.

 
**Mash**
But the Grail...!

 
**Dr. Roman**
This is bad. I'm getting you all out of there now!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Without a way to destroy it, you have no choice but to evacuate...!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
No, I will destroy it. Now that I've lost, this is my way of taking responsibility.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...My conversation with you was worthwhile,
Aŋra Mainiiu. Farewell.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu**
Yeah? If it helped you vent a bit, then I guess it was worth the risk.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu**
I'll let you clean up after yourselves. I'm a slacker at heart, you know. Don't go knocking on my door too often!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Activating Noble Phantasm.
Twin Arm - Big Crunch...!

 
**Dr. Roman**
...That was a close one.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Indeed. But unfortunately, I don't feel bad at all.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Now then... Fujimaru, you're his Master.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Since he's rebelled against you, it's up to you to decide on his punishment.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rain check.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just don't do it again.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Is that all?

 
**Dr. Roman**
(Sigh) I had a feeling you'd say something like that...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Master. To me, the Grail is&ndash;no, the power the Grail brings is my greatest desire.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
If the same thing happens again, I can say with almost certainty that I'll try once more for the Grail.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It can't be helped.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It can't be...helped...?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Um, if it happens again, what will you do, Master?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Will you stop me again?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I see... We'll never see eye to eye on this matter.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's fine.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
What did you say?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll stop you as many times as it takes.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
As long as you're my Master, you'll stop me?
As many times...as it takes?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Well, that's a problem. As a Servant, I cannot betray my Master.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Very well. As long as you're my Master, I won't pursue my dream.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Even if we can't understand each other, we can fight together. Even if we must someday part, we can still hold hands.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
If you will believe in me like that, I swear that I won't give in to my desire.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Anyway, at least give me some form of punishment.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It wouldn't sit well with me otherwise.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Clean my room, or something...?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Thank you, Master.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, will give your room the best cleaning ever!


<h2>Let's Talk about Evil</h2>

**Narration:**
There is nothing helpful to be gained by separating good and evil.

 
**Narration:**
Good people miraculously cause evil to rain down upon us, and the same is true for evil people and good.

 
**Narration:**
...It is instinct itself that gets in the way of doing good. People resort to evil for all manner of reasons.

 
**Narration:**
To eat... To sleep... To escape pain... To earn praise...
To gain respect... To avoid having to think...

 
**Narration:**
To connect with others... To form bonds... To rest...
To have peace of mind... To avoid death...

 
**Narration:**
That is why, sometimes, people choose evil.
It's just not as simple as telling them to be better.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...So I can't blame the samurai we fought at the Shimabara Rebellion for killing my compatriots and myself.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Of course I can never forgive them for what they did.
And I have no desire to do so.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But would we have been any more merciful had the tables had been turned? I doubt it.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Demanding that others do things we can't is one of mankind's worst habits.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, so... Maybe we could talk about something else now?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I gotta say, this isn't really what I had in mind for tea talk.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hahaha, I can't blame you at all for feeling that way.
But I'm not about to stop now.

 
**Fou**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
There have been lots of heroes and such who have tried to resolve the problem of evil once and for all...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...but unfortunately, none of them ever succeeded.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Some of them went about it the wrong way...
Some of them got bogged down in the details...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
And some of them were mistaken about what the end result of their endeavor would be.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Strangely enough, it turns out that in order to eradicate evil...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...one must resort to the decidedly evil measure of sacrificing the few for the sake of the many.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
And of course, in doing so, such an endeavor ceases to be good.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
That is the part that tripped up everyone who attempted this, be they hero, genius, or otherwise.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Which is exactly why you shouldn't lose heart.
After all, this is the only option you have.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'm talking about the Lostbelts. You seem to be taking their loss pretty hard, after all.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
You may give us orders as our Master, but at the same time you also have your own orders to follow.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I appreciate the thought, but I can't let myself get used to this.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes, that's true.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Getting used to it would erase one of your key advantages.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Most Servants are merciless, myself included.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
After all, whether it's for a greater cause, our country, our loved ones, or ourselves, we wield our blades.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
And we would never have become heroes had we not grown accustomed to fighting.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But you're an ordinary person. And as long as you remain so, you'll never get used to that.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
One slight misstep on the path to your destination, and you could even end up with lifelong trauma.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
However, that willingness to hold your ground even as you get hurt, despite not being a hero...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...is also why you shine so bright.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I...think I get it?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It's fine if you don't understand everything.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
As long as you continue to do what you can, that's all that matters.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I just try to help however I can.
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Indeed. That's all you need to do.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Simply doing what they can is all any human can hope to do.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Expecting anything more requires us to stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh my, look at the time. I didn't mean to go on this long. All right, I think I'd better bid you good night now.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Sweet dreams.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...There we go.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'm sorry, that was more than a little intentional.
I expect when [♂ he /♀️ she} goes to sleep tonight, [♂ he'll /♀️ she'll} end up wandering into the rift.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I can't let [♂ him /♀️ her} depart this world now,
so I'm going to tag along and tie up some loose ends.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Luckily, it should be easy for you to carry me there, right?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Thank you. Now I can finally clean up this mess.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What the!? Where am I!?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hello again, Master. Can you see how horribly everything is burning here?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Oh? You seem suspicious about something. It's almost as though you think I'm responsible for us being here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aren't you?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Indeed, I am.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aaamaaakuuusaaa!?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
That's me. Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, your faithful Servant.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hahaha, now you seem more suspicious than ever.
Hahaha.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Unfortunately, you've every right to be.

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
This is as much your nightmare as it is mine.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Do you remember seeing this scenery before?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I do. This place is&ndash;


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Indeed. Reality Marble: The Hell of Shimabara...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
The living hell you once experienced in the Shimousa Province Pseudo-Singularity.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I too experienced something very similar to it back when I was alive.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But, why are we seeing this again now?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
That would be my doing. Do you remember what we talked about before bedtime?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
About Lostbelts, and evil, and all that jazz?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It was through that talk that these memories came back to life and merged with the curses you've been accumulating.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Normally, driving such curses away falls to another Servant, but tonight, I asked him to let me handle it.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...So yes, this was all intentional.
I'm sorry I dragged you into it, but...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh well, I guess it's okay.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh? You really don't mind? Even though, by all accounts, this is a fairly serious situation?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You had a reason for doing this, right?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know you didn't do this for no reason.


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...
...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Well, now I'm kind of embarrassed.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
All right, if you trust me that much, I'll go ahead and tell you everything. No more lies.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But first...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
We need to dispose of these riffraff.
Let's talk more once this is over, shall we?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds good!


---

**--BATTLE--**

**Amakusa Shirou**
Now then, as I was saying.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Over the course of your adventures, Master, you've been unwittingly collecting some...less than desirable things.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I speak of the kind of residual feelings wild beasts can only dream about. In a word: grudges.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
And while you may not usually be aware of them, these grudges still find ways to cause you pain.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Of course, Da Vinci and the rest of Chaldea's staff do everything they can to care for your mental health...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But it's just not enough.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
And because it's not enough, an Avenger has also been secretly helping you, even as he pretends not to care.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
However, there are some things that not even he can do.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
As you've escaped Chaldea and gone on journey after journey, you've continued to accumulate curses slowly but surely.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Curses that will destroy a core part of you someday.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
So this time, I decided to try handling one of these...let's say karmic debts before it got too big.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Left unchecked, curses can grow into dreadful, powerful things.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But, if I can give this one some form of direction...
it might just change into something I desire.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait. You don't mean&ndash;


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I do. I've always wanted to meet this other being who called himself by my name ever since I heard about him.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Now, what other name did he go by again?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Ah yes. Sorcerer.

 
**???**
Haha, hahaha. Hahahaha!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

 
**???**
Foolish. Foolish! How incredibly foolish! I knew my Heroic Spirit self had been reduced to slaving for humanity...

 
**???**
But I would never have dreamed he was this foolhardily ignorant!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Well now, that didn't take long at all.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I don't suppose you could also manifest Onriedo Castle while you're at it?

 
**Sorcerer**
...I cannot.

 
**Sorcerer**
All I can do now that I am a mere dreg of my former self is to recreate this very place.

 
**Sorcerer**
But now, to my surprise...

 
**Sorcerer**
...that [♂ boy /♀️ girl} there has chosen to throw
[♂ his /♀️ her} life away of [♂ his /♀️ her} own volition!

 
**Sorcerer**
I was prepared to spend years&ndash;decades, if necessary&ndash;clinging to life in the darkest recesses of [♂ his /♀️ her} brain stem, but&ndash;

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hahaha, I can't imagine that would have worked out for you.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It would've only been a matter of time before you were discovered and scrubbed away...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...or burned to ashes by a certain someone I could name.

 
**Sorcerer**
Exactly.

 
**Sorcerer**
A tiny mouse can never hope to defeat a tiger, after all. But now, you have committed a crime of arrogance.

 
**Sorcerer**
One that resulted in giving me an opportunity with which to manifest my very self!

 
**Sorcerer**
My next step will be to destroy that [♂ boy's /♀️ girl's}
mind, turn [♂ him /♀️ her} into my puppet, and then&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, am I in as much danger as it sounds like?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Don't be silly. Surely you haven't forgotten that I'm here too, have you?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Everything will be fine. I promise.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
In fact...I'll even say this.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hehe.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
According to my calculations...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...I'm ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wha... Are you nuts!? You just doomed us!
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh good, you got what I meant. Excellent.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why would you even voice that possibility!?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Hahaha, I'm just kidding.

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I always wanted to say something like that once in my life.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I never thought I'd get the chance to actually say it loud and proud like that.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Of course, chances like that are few and far between in reality, but here...

 
**Sorcerer**
Huh?

 
**Sorcerer**
What in the world are you talking about?

 
**Sorcerer**
No, never mind that. How can you be so confident!?

 
**Sorcerer**
You think me an imposter!? Do you make light of me, as a fragment of my former self!?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Not at all.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'm not making light of you in the slightest, nor do I think you're anything less than a formidable opponent.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'm just fully confident that I can beat you anyway.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
To be completely honest, I wasn't sure how this would go until I came face-to-face with you.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But now that I have, I can say this with complete certainty:

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I will never end up like you.

 
**Sorcerer**
...!

 
**Sorcerer**
No. No, you absolutely won't!

 
**Sorcerer**
How could you, now that you've thrown away your revenge, and forgotten these flames!?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...
...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
You're wrong there, Avenger.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I've never forgotten these flames or this hell.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
All I've done...is make peace with them.

 
**Sorcerer**
Ridiculous!!!

 
**Sorcerer**
How can you claim with a straight face that you've forgiven such cruelty? Such despair?

 
**Sorcerer**
Are you telling me I should just forget it ever happened? That I should wash my hands of it like so much soap!?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'm afraid you've fundamentally misunderstood me, sorcerer. We may be similar, but you are definitely not me.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Just because I've made my peace with it doesn't mean I've forgotten it, or my hatred.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But my hatred was only reserved for mankind's sins.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Then, we come to everything good in the world.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Until my body completely falls apart, I'm going to keep searching for a way to purge evil and save all of humanity.

 
**Sorcerer**
...You're no hero. You're not even a saint.

 
**Sorcerer**
You're just broken! A half-wit chasing delusions!
There is no possible way I will fall to the likes of you!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It seems we really are fundamentally the same at heart then, right down to the things we say.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Which means this battle will all come down to the strength of our trump cards. All right, let's get to it, shall we?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
My name is Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Though you may look like me, if I must destroy you in order to purify your curse...I won't hesitate to do so.

 
**Sorcerer**
...!

 
**Sorcerer**
Very well then! If you truly think you're capable of it, then go ahead and try!!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Sorcerer**
You... You bastaaaaaard! You're nothing but a damn hypocrite pretending to be a good Samaritan!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Well, I can't say you're wrong there.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But...it's still better than going around doing evil while not even trying to pretend otherwise, don't you think?

 
**Sorcerer**
Why!? Why don't you loathe them!?
Why don't you despise them!?

 
**Sorcerer**
I have every right to hate the Tokugawa family! Shimabara was hell on earth, in every sense of the word!

 
**Sorcerer**
Ordering their starving citizens to die...
Killing mothers in front of their children...

 
**Sorcerer**
The Tokugawas exploited us mercilessly for years on end! And you would have me forgive them!?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes, it was hell on earth. Which is why I'm going to make damn sure it never happens again.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
My goal is to save all of humanity and usher in an era of permanent peace.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'll admit...your grudge is not without merit.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
That anger and hatred are like scars carved into my Spirit Origin. I'll never be entirely free of them.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
In that sense, the only difference between you and me is that you're still giving them voice.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But when it comes to hurting my Master,
our goals couldn't be further apart.

 
**Sorcerer**
...I see...

 
**Sorcerer**
But...that doesn't mean I'm about to give up!

 
**Sorcerer**
I will never lose to the likes of you! Never!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
This is as far as that spirit of yours goes, sorcerer.
Come. Let's finish this.

 
**Sorcerer**
...
...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...
...

 
**Narration:**
...In strength, skill, and striking distance, they were each practically identical. Between two such opponents, a single ordinary strike could render all their prior injuries meaningless.

 
**Narration:**
Given that their fortune, compassion,
and resolve were each perfectly matched...

 
**Narration:**
...victory would go to the one with greater determination.

 
**Sorcerer**
...
...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Phew. For all my big talk, that turned out to be disturbingly close.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So...that sorcerer was you?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was he another way you could have gone?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Yes, I suppose so.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
In my case, I just happened to end up with a mission to save all of humanity.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But if I had never found that mission, and continued to nurture my hatred...I may well have ended up like him.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Or perhaps he's simply another side of me who could have been summoned under different circumstances.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
But either way, that's just an empty hypothesis now.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
For my part, I've never forgotten that promise.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
“Even if we can't understand each other, we can fight together. Even if we must someday part, we can still hold hands.”

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
While I am still trying to save all of humanity, my vow to you comes first.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
You know...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...that sorcerer's purity may be the same quality I just lost in myself.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even though you're clearly having fun?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Ah, you'll have to forgive me for that.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Let's just say that in losing some things, we gain others.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But you're okay with that, right?
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Of course.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
If I wasn't, I would have left right after humanity had been restored.

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Now then, Master, give me your hand, and let's wake up from this nightmare together.

 
**Narration:**
Some time later...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
All right, the library is nice and organized. Now I just have to go through the things from Chaldea that have been left lying around...

 
**Inshun**
Pardon me, Lord Amakusa.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh, hello, Lord Houzouin. What can I do for you?

 
**Inshun**
Well...

 
**Inshun**
...I'm just about to have a sparring session with Lord Yagyu in the combat simulator.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I see. But I'm afraid I'm not sure what that has to do with me...?

 
**Inshun**
I'm getting to that. Would you mind if I copied your catchphrase during our duel?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
My catchphrase?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...Oh no!

 
**Inshun**
I'm ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!!!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Khh...!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
H-hearing it from someone else's mouth is even more devastating than I'd imagined!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Wait, hang on. How do you even know about that? On second thought, don't tell me.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
It was Master, wasn't it? Hehehe, I can't believe
[♂ he /♀️ she} of all people would blab about that!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...On third thought, I absolutely can! Dammit!
I knew I should have paid [♂ him /♀️ her} to keep [♂ his /♀️ her} mouth shut!

 
**Inshun**
Well...

 
**Inshun**
I believe all will be clear once you pay a visit to the cafeteria.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
The cafeteria!? Crap! I'll go there right now!

 
**Inshun**
...Alas, I'm afraid it may already be too late.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then he held up his sword and said this!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
“I'm ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!”


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Gaaah! I'm too late!

 
**Sakata Kintoki**
Damn, Amakusa, that's really golden!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou**
I'm so sorry, Amakusa.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou**
I confess I may have been a bit wary around you, especially since the Shimousa incident.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou**
I had no idea you were capable of saying something like that so earnestly. On behalf of the Fuuma clan, I apologize for my misconception. That was indeed worthy of praise.

 
**Jack**
That's so cool! We wanna say it too!

 
**Jack**
“We're ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!”

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily**
That's so logical of you to account for the remote possibility that you might lose, Mentor!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily**
I want to be ninety-nine point nine percent sure of winning too! What's the trick? Is it glasses? Do I need glasses!?

 
**Osakabehime**
I'm still amazed you actually won after saying something like that.

 
**Osakabehime**
I mean, that kind of line is just begging for dramatic irony to come and smack you down!

 
**Osakabehime**
Still, it's so good that I absolutely have to use it in my next book. Arigathanks for the inspiration!

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
How could I let this happen!?

 
**Semiramis**
Hmm, interesting. Veeery interesting.

 
**Semiramis**
Being cool and collected is all well and good, but in your case, you always use your smile as a mask to hide your true feelings.

 
**Semiramis**
I never thought I would see you panic with such urgency. This has been most entertaining.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Not you too!

 
**Semiramis**
What is wrong with it, Amakusa Shirou?

 
**Semiramis**
“I'm ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!”

 
**Semiramis**
Yes, I have taken a liking to it as well. I think I will continue to say it for the time being.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Please don't...

 
**Semiramis**
Oh, worry not. These sorts of fads die as quickly as they begin. You need merely suffer humiliation until this one blows over.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
(Sigh)... I guess you're right.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I'll just have to chalk this up as another punishment to endure.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
...
...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Besides, to be honest...

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
I still can't entirely deny that catchphrase's sheer coolness.

 
**Semiramis**
Hm? Did you say something?

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Oh, it's nothing.

 
**Amakusa Shirou**
Ninety-nine point nine percent...nothing at all!
