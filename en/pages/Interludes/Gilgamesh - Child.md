# Gilgamesh (Child)

<h2>How to Love a Wild Flower</h2>

**Mash**
...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
...Nice...

 
**Mash**
Oh... I'm sorry, it seems I spaced out a little.
What do you mean by “nice”?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Oh, it's nothing, Mash.
Just something that crossed my mind.

 
**Mash**
Um... “Mash”? It is kind of refreshing hearing that from you.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
You don't like me saying your name?
I can call you something else if it's too frank.

 
**Mash**
Oh, no, it's not that. I am just a little surprised you would use my name.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Oh. Well, I'm glad it doesn't bother you. Ah... Come to think of it, this place is full of things that I'm glad about.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
First and foremost, I'm glad you summoned me.

 
**Mash**
Huh... What do you mean?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I mean I'm glad you didn't summon my adult self.
It seems something strange is going on this time...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
So there's a possibility that my adult self would be summoned at the same time.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Oh. I see...

 
**Dr. Roman**
To be honest, we're not sure how to act around you either... I mean, what should we call you?

 
**Dr. Roman**
No, wait. Safety first. I have to be careful with my words... My king, how would you like for us mongrels to address you?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Oh, come on, you don't need to be so nervous, Doctor. I'm not that me you're thinking of.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I don't lash out just because I don't like something.
Geez, that guy is such a man-child.

 
**Dr. Roman**
(I bet the world's oldest King of Heroes never imagined his childhood self would be dissing him like this...)

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
At any rate, you can be casual with me... I know.
You can call me Gil.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's good to meet you, Gil.
 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
It's good to meet you too, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a pleasure to meet you, future King Gil!
 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Oh please, Master.
I'm just a Servant. An Archer.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Just treat me like any other Servant.

 


---
 
**Mash**
I feel the same. ...I am happy to have you around, Gil.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Likewise. Oh! I just thought of another thing that I'm glad about.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm so glad that I got to meet a wonderful person like you, Mash.

 
**Mash**
Huh...?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Just so you know, I actually have a good eye for women.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
As for my adult self, however, he probably wouldn't even notice your beauty...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
...Wait, actually... He might be attracted to certain aspects of you.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
It's just a feeling, I'm not sure how to probably put that into words...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
But anyway, I for one appreciate how lovely and sweet you are. Although sometimes you can get a little too serious...

 
**Mash**
P-Please don't tease me, Gil...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I agree 100%.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've known that from the beginning!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Senpai, you too!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hahaha. We mean nothing by it.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Don't be shy. It's natural to feel happy when someone compliments you.

 
**Mash**
That's not the issue...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Mm? Wait a second. That's...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Enemy attack!

 
**Mash**
I guess we don't have the luxury to sit around and chat anymore.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
(Sigh) Just when I was about to enjoy the company of a lovely flower. Take a hint already.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
However, this is also something I'm glad about.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I might look like a child, but since I'm summoned as a Servant, I'll prove to you that I can be useful in battle as well.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
(Besides, there's something else I want to be sure of.)

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
(What made Mash into the lovely flower she is today? Depending on that answer...)


**--BATTLE--**

**Gilgamesh (Child)**
And there you have it.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Mash, you've got potential, but it's raw and unrefined.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
For your own sake, you should let me give you a helping hand. By all means!

 
**Mash**
C-Come again...?

 
**Dr. Roman**
I don't really understand, but I assume that's the reason we are here by the beach. What do you have in mind?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Good question. First, we have to do something about that outfit.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I'm not sure if you should be wearing that armor all the time. It adds a rustic feel to your loveliness.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
You should wear something more girly once in a while.

 
**Mash**
Girly...? My Chaldea uniform is made for women...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Nope, that doesn't count. Mass-produced items are not good. It has to be one of a kind...

 
**Da Vinci**
Grazie!
Grazie molto!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Da Vinci!? Would you stop hijacking our communication channel!?

 
**Da Vinci**
Oh hush, Roman.
Kid Gil just said something amazing!

 
**Da Vinci**
Actually, I've been thinking the same thing.
Mash is just squandering away her beauty.

 
**Da Vinci**
There's no need to reiterate it, but research has shown that one's outfit is an essential element in the pursuit of beauty.

 
**Da Vinci**
After all, look at me. This outfit is one of a kind, naturally. I designed it myself.

 
**Da Vinci**
Although I'm a little different since I don't have a gender, or rather, my gender is Mona Lisa, but let's leave that aside.

 
**Da Vinci**
No matter where and when, civilized girls should care about their fashion.

 
**Da Vinci**
I understand, Mash. You pretend you don't care, but it's been bugging you deep down inside, right?

 
**Da Vinci**
It must've been tough... But it's alright now.
I am an ally to all those who pursue beauty.

 
**Mash**
U-Um, actually, I don't really&ndash;

 
**Da Vinci**
Yes! To put it simply, I agree with Kid Gil here 100%!

 
**Da Vinci**
We're like a talent agency that records, analyzes, arranges, advises, and creates résumés for auditions!

 
**Da Vinci**
I, Leonardo da Vinci, promise to do everything in my power as an artist to support you!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
It seems I have a reliable ally. How reassuring.
Thank you, beautiful Da Vinci.

 
**Da Vinci**
Oh... The King of Heroes certainly does have a discerning eye. You know, you're a lot cooler as a child than as an adult.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Hahaha. Now let's never speak of it again.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Back to business. It's the first time we're all here, plus the location is perfect, so...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I think Mash should put this on.

 
**Da Vinci**
Oh, a swimsuit! What better way to show the beauty of the sea!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
He did it so casually, but I feel like I just witnessed a Noble Phantasm being utilized in an extremely wasteful way.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Don't worry about that. I'm not.
Here, Mash, put this on.

 
**Mash**
That's easy for you to say!

 
**Mash**
Um... Uh... Senpai, what do you think?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Honestly, I really want to see it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You'll look good in it! I LOVE THE SEA!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Senpai...

 
**Mash**
...Okay. Fine. I'll go change, so please wait here a couple of minutes.

 
**Dr. Roman**
HURRAY!

 
**Da Vinci**
Romani, I'm telling you right now, give me the recorder's control.

 
**Da Vinci**
There are all kinds of ethical issues if you start recording video of Mash in a swimsuit.

 
**Da Vinci**
However, those issues don't apply to me! I am simply recording her to observe and preserve her beauty.

 
**Dr. Roman**
(Hmm... I'm only curious since I'm like a father to her... I'm also a doctor...)

 
**Dr. Roman**
(Therefore I have a responsibility to observe her growth. I'm not interested in her beyond that...)

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Well, now that Mash has gone to change, let's talk about something serious.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
...Namely, the danger she's in.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Danger?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Yes. I realized it by watching her in our last fight.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Her fragility is precisely what makes a flower like her so lovely.

 
**Da Vinci**
Hmm, I'm afraid I don't follow.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
She always puts her Master's safety before anything else. In an extremely excessive way.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
In a dangerous situation, she would throw away her life to protect her Master.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
However, there's not a shred of conviction nor experience as a warrior in her actions.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Mash feels fear and confusion, but risks her life without conquering either.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Do you think that's how she should live her life?

 
**Da Vinci**
...? I don't see a problem.
In fact, I think it's incredibly heroic.

 
**Da Vinci**
After all, it just means her dedication to Fujimaru outweighs both those emotions.

 
**Da Vinci**
I'm envious. I wish I could meet a dependable bodyguard like that.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
(Sigh) ...A genius just doesn't get it. You don't understand the feelings of an average person.

 
**Da Vinci**
That's rude. I do understand.
Mash is a faithful Servant who embodies perseverance.

 
**Da Vinci**
I do worry about her offensive capabilities, but she's a reliable shield for Fujimaru.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
All right, fine. What do you think, Doctor?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Huh? About what?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
How would you describe Mash's current state?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Um... How indeed... That's not something I can really say right off the bat...

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Oh. I knew it.
You do understand, don't you?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Then I won't point it out. I'm sure you'll atone for your laziness in the end.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Ah well. Anyway, Mash is too much like a Servant.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Yes, she's a Demi-Servant, but ultimately she's still a human. I think it's a shame to let that part of her go to waste.

 
**Da Vinci**
Hmm... Is that why you are trying to draw out the girly part in her? As a way for her to get in touch with her humanity?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Precisely. Displays of emotion are a human strength.
It's a waste that she doesn't use them.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Well, I'll admit I really just want to see her in a swimsuit.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Heh... She can't escape my eyes. That's right, I can tell she has curves in all the right places!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Anyway, she'll be back any min&ndash;

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
...Huh?

 
**Mash**
Emergency! Enemy alert!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
...Come again? Wait, Mash, how come you're not in a swimsuit!? Where's the dynamite body!?

 
**Da Vinci**
That's right, the swimsuit! Where's the dazzling beauty!? Where's the dynamite body!?

 
**Da Vinci**
I was going to exploit the situation and slip into a swimsuit myself! That will improve my popularity and my presence as the embodiment of beauty! Bravo!

 
**Da Vinci**
It was the perfect plan! Now what'll become of it!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
That's what you were thinking...?

 
**Mash**
That swimsuit... I was going to put it on, but then I had a good look at it and... um, well, it's not something I could ever wear.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Ahhh... That's because I got it from my treasury.
I guess the style isn't very modern?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I predicted such a reaction, so I gave you several designs.

 
**Mash**
Th-That's not the problem!

 
**Mash**
All of them had visual defects...

 
**Mash**
I mean, one was just made of strings, another was semi-transparent, one didn't have a top half...

 
**Mash**
Or it did have a top half, but I don't count clamshells as suitable!

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Huh? What's wrong with that? I like that kind of thing. Especially if it means seeing women in a state of embarrassment.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Is that unintentional or not...? A-Anyway, right now our priority is eliminating the enemy in front of us! Go for it, everyone!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
Phew... Senpai, are you okay?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep, not even a scratch.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I am, thanks to you, Mash.
 


---
 
**Mash**
Really? I'm glad to hear it.

 
**Mash**
I'll check the surrounding area to see if there are any enemies left. Senpai, please stay on guard as well.

 
**Da Vinci**
...Now that you mention it, she does act like a Servant. Probably even more than one...

 
**Dr. Roman**
That's because Mash was raised in Chaldea and duty has always been her priority. So she was well-grounded before all this.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I wouldn't call an aptitude that was forced on her being “well-grounded.” That's called a curse, Archaman.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Humph. You're being argumentative this time around. Were you this compassionate as a Heroic Spirit?

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Oh, please. Tastes can change, but that doesn't change the underlying personality.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
If my adult self is cold-hearted, then so am I. The difference is in whether it's expressed in moderation.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
But it looks like I was being too much of a busybody. Ultimately, what we're able to do doesn't amount to much.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
So, Master.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
You're the one who's closest to Mash, so please watch out for her.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
How did she fight? What kind of fight was it?
These are important questions, so don't forget.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
That's what I'm trying to say.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Got it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Thank you.
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Well, you seem to be a sharp person, Master.
I don't really think I needed to say all that.

 
**Mash**
It looks like we obliterated the threat, Senpai.

 
**Mash**
...Um, also, I'd like to say something, just so there's no misunderstanding.

 
**Mash**
...

 
**Mash**
I don't have anything against wearing a swimsuit in front of you, Senpai.

 
**Mash**
But this time around, the swimsuits Gil prepared for me were...just too advanced for my level...

 
**Mash**
If it were a normal swimsuit...and the occasion arose...
I wouldn't mind...

 
**Mash**
Th-That's all I wanted to say. Pardon me.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Yes, food for thought. Instead of worrying now, it's like there's promise for the future.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
So it looks like you don't need me to stick around. I'll let Master continue to polish this diamond in the rough.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
Ah, but if you ever need a tool to help draw out her girly side, let me know anytime.

 
**Gilgamesh (Child)**
I may have just what you need in my treasury!

 
**Da Vinci**
And where beauty is involved,
don't forget good ol' Da Vinci.

 
**Da Vinci**
If she seems to be even a little uncertain about her own idea of beauty, don't hesitate to send her my way.

 
**Da Vinci**
Because nobody surpasses me when it comes to acquiring femininity!

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Right. Well, certainly, it's a matter that deserves some thought.

 
**Dr. Roman**
For me, as long as Mash is healthy, I can't ask for anything more...

 
**Dr. Roman**
But it's a good thing to have a little color in your life! Maybe I'll scrape together some funds to make a swimsuit for Mash!
