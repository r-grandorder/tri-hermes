# Iskandar

<h2>Conqueror of Life</h2>

**Iskandar**
Hrm... What is this wasteland?

 
**Iskandar**
I came along excited about the prospect of a new battle, but this place is cold and bare.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Really? I thought the great King of Conquerors who trampled the Persian desert would find this place nostalgic.

 
**Iskandar**
Fool. The glorious battlefields of my memories were blazing gold at day and like tranquil moonlight at night. A sea of sand so mystical, it roused the heart.

 
**Iskandar**
It's nothing like this empty bore of a ruin.
It's vastly different in epicness and scale.

 
**Mash**
Wouldn't you say an empty plain like this is rather convenient for battle, since you don't need to worry about harming innocent bystanders?

 
**Iskandar**
Convenient!? If it's not a fruitful land that gets the heart pumping, how do you know what you're fighting for!

 
**Dr. Roman**
What you're fighting for, huh.
Then, may I ask, why do you fight?

 
**Iskandar**
It's obvious! To conquer! To reach the undiscovered land and claim it as my own!

 
**Mash**
...I see. I expect nothing less from you, Senpai. You have summoned yet another troublesome Heroic Spirit.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, what a headache.
 
**Mash**
...I feel that's putting it lightly...
He's almost a supervillain...

 
**Dr. Roman**
Now, now. There's no need to be so pessimistic.

 
**Dr. Roman**
In order to have a harmonious relationship with Servants, a positive outlook on things is most important, Mash.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Actually, this is fine.
 
**Dr. Roman**
Are you saying that you have no problem controlling Servants, no matter how extraordinary of a Heroic Spirit they are?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Perhaps that's just your positive thinking talking? ...To be honest, I'm a little concerned about your optimism...

 
**Dr. Roman**
No. In a situation as desperate as this, confidence and optimism are our ultimate weapons.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Fujimaru has proven yet again [♂ his /♀️ her} high suitability as a Master.

**Fou**
Fou??? (Suspiciously)

 
**Dr. Roman**
King of Conquerors. You seem unimpressed with the world you've been summoned to, but why not think of it this way?

 
**Dr. Roman**
The crisis of destruction we are facing right now has the potential to make every land of this world into barren wastelands.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Which means the enthralling land that you seek to conquer will no longer be if nothing is done.

 
**Iskandar**
Oh-ho? That is a grave concern. This is no battle.
It's simply a disaster.

 
**Mash**
You are not wrong to think so. To be honest, we do not fully understand the enemy ourselves.

 
**Iskandar**
No matter what it may be, as long as it has a physical body that bleeds when I cut it, I'll have no problem fighting.

 
**Iskandar**
Basically, you just want me to slaughter those ghastly creatures coming right at us, yeah?

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Say what!? Oh crap!
Look out, you're surrounded!


**--BATTLE--**

**Iskandar**
...Hm. Now that I've fought against some, I understand. This is no battle. This is some kind of cataclysm.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Meaning?

 
**Iskandar**
There's no passion in the enemy's fist. No emotion nor warm blood coursing through them. They are like locusts or portents of disaster. They are no warriors.

 
**Mash**
...Um, so you're saying,
they're like ghosts?

 
**Iskandar**
Hm. I cannot simply let such creatures roam free.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We need your help.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You'll regret it if you ignore them.
 


---
 
**Iskandar**
Indeed. With another conquest up ahead, it seems we need to settle this matter first.

 
**Iskandar**
This is a bizarre turn of events, but as you've summoned me, I shall offer you my sword, Master.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Ah yes! Now this is what Servant cooperation is all about! See how negotiation can make anything possible, Mash?

 
**Dr. Roman**
To be honest, I was on guard when I heard the King of Macedonia was here, but he's quite the man! He's so heroic, but not too rough!

 
**Mash**
I wouldn't call it negotiation...
I feel like the fight convinced him.

 
**Iskandar**
Now that's settled, we need to prepare!

 
**Iskandar**
Military strategies change with the time and place.
I must learn more about this era!

 
**Dr. Roman**
Ah! That's quite convincing coming from the great hero who sought world domination!

 
**Iskandar**
Being summoned as a Servant granted me knowledge of your era, but it does not feel real yet.

 
**Iskandar**
Yes, I need...personal experience...

 
**Mash**
And what kind of preparations do you have in mind?

 
**Iskandar**
First and foremost, information from literature.
And a map.

 
**Mash**
...I'm a little surprised that you'd be so meticulous in forming military strategies.

 
**Iskandar**
Obviously. A guide is necessary when exploring foreign lands. Maybe not an interpreter, but I do want literature to help steer our way.

 
**Iskandar**
Prepare something that lists must-see sights, local foods, and what times are the busy times. Make sure they don't skimp on the details.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Huh?

 
**Iskandar**
And...clothing. We wouldn't be fully immersing ourselves in local fare if it's just food and lodging.

 
**Iskandar**
Attire unique to that country! Just a wardrobe change changes your entire perspective!

 
**Iskandar**
My retainers all hated to do it.
But it really is amusing.

 
**Mash**
...Look at that smile. It's like saying, “I can get anything I want.” A royal ego like that reminds me of Gil... I mean, a different king that we know.

 
**Mash**
But when King Iskandar says it, I think I understand why his retainers would give in.

 
**Mash**
So, this is the king who thought to slice through the Gordian Knot. Only Senpai could summon a Servant like this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not true!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe that's true!
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
Well, um...yeah. I guess it wouldn't kill us to have a, uh, couple people around with one or two screws loose.

 
**Dr. Roman**
On that same note, maybe it wouldn't be so strange to have a king who mixes up tourism with conquest.

 
**Fou**
Foooou?

 
**Dr. Roman**
My point is, no matter what this Heroic Spirit's interpretation of the situation is...

 
**Dr. Roman**
As long as we can count on him in battle, I don't see any issue... I guess?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That may be true...
 
**Iskandar**
Hahaha! That's the spirit!

 
**Iskandar**
As my contractor, that's the attitude you need!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not necessarily true...
 
**Iskandar**
Hahahaha! There's nothing to fear! Life itself is a battle. Those who enjoy it will be victorious!

 
**Iskandar**
No matter your predicament, first eat your fill! Sing! Rest! Then you can worry about it after!

 


---
 
**Fou**
Foooou... (Dumbfounded)


<h2>The Unending Expedition</h2>

**Mash**
Let me reiterate! We need to retreat immediately! There's nothing we can gain from this battle!

 
**Iskandar**
Wahahaha! You may be right, Shield Maiden, but our escape route is now closed off! We just need to bite the bullet.

 
**Dr. Roman**
...Unfortunately, he's right, Mash. Now that you've started the battle, you'll need to fight to get through.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is all because Iskandar just had to meddle...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We could've escaped if you kept quiet...
 


---
 
**Iskandar**
Come now, don't say that!

 
**Iskandar**
The winds that blow in this land reminded me of Persia. It brought back the days of my passionate young blood!

 
**Iskandar**
And just when I felt like wreaking havoc here again, this lot showed up in need of a real thrashing!

 
**Mash**
What a meatheaded thought process...
Senpai, be careful you don't get carried away, too!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, don't get distracted.
 
**Iskandar**
Wahahaha! That's my Master there! You really do have keen insight into the workings of battle!

 
**Mash**
Senpai, where were you from again?
Did you work in a super exploitative company before coming to Chaldea?

 
**Mash**
What I'm saying is that you seem very adept at navigating a conflict and unreasonable demands!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I hate my life!
 
**Iskandar**
Wahaha! Don't say that. Come, even my Bucephalus is excited by the prospect of battle!

 
**Fou**
Foooou!

 
**Iskandar**
Even that little squirrel over there is excited!

 
**Mash**
Fou!?

 


---
 
**Iskandar**
Besides, this battle may have begun as just a fun romp, but that may not be the case now.

 
**Dr. Roman**
What do you mean?

 
**Iskandar**
When I arrived in this land for an expedition, King Darius' troops were not the only ones who blocked our path.

 
**Iskandar**
They were like the evil spirits that we are fighting right now. They were relentless in ambushing us.

 
**Iskandar**
And along with those old memories...
My men say their blood is stirring.

 
**Mash**
Huh?

 
**Iskandar**
They want to fight! Like back in the day... So fiercely, so courageously! Wagering their short lives for a chance at glory!

 
**Iskandar**
Men who had gathered to join in my path to conquer across the sea of sand! That is what they desire!

 
**Iskandar**
So, as king, I must answer their call!

 
**Dr. Roman**
What's with this sudden&mdash;!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Where are we?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman**
A Reality Marble! But this is strange. How could the King of Conquerors as a Rider manage such powerful magecraft?

 
**Dr. Roman**
No, wait a minute! I detect numerous Servant signatures nearby!

 
**Dr. Roman**
This... What is going on!?
I'm detecting more than 10,000!

 
**Iskandar**
Ah, look at your faces! Even I am excited. I'm trembling!

 
**Iskandar**
Now, raise your voices for battle!

 
**Iskandar**
The time of wonderment is here, Fujimaru, Shield Maiden! This is truly my kingship! My bond! My ultimate Noble Phantasm!

 
**Iskandar**
Run them down! Ionioi Hetairoi!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
Amazing... Was that your Noble Phantasm?

 
**Dr. Roman**
The successive Servant summoning was a surprise! How many Servants were there!? Who knew they'd all be Heroic Spirits!?

 
**Iskandar**
Yes, indeed. They all went wild to their hearts' content. As usual, my men are unbelievable.

 
**Iskandar**
Fujimaru, and Shield Maiden as well. To see you unmoved by the mass of strong enemies was admirable.

 
**Iskandar**
My men were also in awe of your recklessness.

 
**Mash**
...Th-thank you.

 
**Iskandar**
If there ever is another opportunity to wade into battle together, they would be more than happy to, is what they are saying.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Um...I don't quite understand what's going on, but can we assume you will help us out again?

 
**Iskandar**
Indeed. Not only do you have my support, but my men have all agreed as well.

 
**Iskandar**
Therefore, I declare here and now:

 
**Iskandar**
Under the banner of the King of Conquerors Iskandar, we of the Eastern Expedition Mixed Army shall participate in the Grand Order.

 
**Iskandar**
My Master! Command my Noble Phantasm,
“Ionioi Hetairoi,” well!
