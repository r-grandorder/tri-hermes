# Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova

 
<h2>A Despairing Past and a Hopeful Future</h2>
 
**Anastasia**
Ah, there you are, Master.
May I speak to you for a moment?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 
**Anastasia**
Wonderful. That's just what I like to hear.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure, but what's this about?
 
**Anastasia**
Well, as it turns out, it's about something extremely important. Something that directly concerns me.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Let me get straight to the point:
I have something I wish to confess to you.

 
**Anastasia**
Well, that's rude. There's no need to look as though you're bracing for impact.

 
**Anastasia**
Unlike a certain dragon princess I could name,
I am under no delusions about who you truly are.

 
**Anastasia**
...Ahem.

 
**Anastasia**
I know I may have been treating you a bit, well, coldly, Master. Not to put too fine a point on it.

 
**Anastasia**
Yet despite that, you have been perfectly patient with me and welcomed me with open arms.

 
**Anastasia**
Therefore, I feel it is only right that I let my hair down, so to speak, and be my true self around here.

 
**Anastasia**
I know what the others say about me.

 
**Anastasia**
“The young beauty so cool she's ice-cold.”
“Prim and proper to a fault.”

 
**Anastasia**
“A porcelain doll who'll shatter at the slightest touch.”
“Lovely bangs that half-hide her eyes.”

 
**Anastasia**
Those are just a few of the things I've heard myself called.

 
**Anastasia**
But the truth is...

 
**Anastasia**
I am...

 
**Anastasia**
An irredeemable imp.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bwa?
 
**Anastasia**
I suppose I should be thankful that you seem so befuddled.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
An imp? Really?
 
**Anastasia**
Oh? You sound skeptical.

 
**Anastasia**
Then again, I suppose I'm usually so elegantly well-behaved that it's no wonder you find it hard to believe.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
At any rate, the reason why I went to the trouble of announcing it like this...

 
**Anastasia**
...is because now that you and I are on better terms, you have an obligation to know who I truly am.

 
**Anastasia**
Specifically, I'm going to engage in mischief.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mischief, huh...?


---
 
**Anastasia**
Yes. Mischief.

 
**Anastasia**
There is something about making mischief that makes my heart dance with joy. Perhaps it takes me back to my childhood days or something like that.

 
**Anastasia**
At any rate, I can no longer bear to act like the good little girl I'm not, so I will no longer be doing so.

 
**Anastasia**
But I will apologize in advance for the mischief I'm going to cause. I'm sorry, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it. But what kind of mischief are we talking about here?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, so exactly what kind of mischief did you have in mind?


---
 
**Anastasia**
For that...

 
**Anastasia**
You'll just have to wait till tomorrow to find out.

 
**Anastasia**
Teeheeheehee.

 
**Anastasia**
...Teeheeheehee.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, time to get up...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and seize the...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
day!?


---
 
**Anastasia**
Did I surprise you!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll say you did...


---
 
**Anastasia**
Teeheehee. My first bit of mischief was to change your room around.

 
**Anastasia**
Of course, this is nothing the professor et al. haven't already done, so I'm still only getting started.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, but can I at least change into my uniform first?
 
**Anastasia**
Oh my.

 
**Anastasia**
Very well then, I'll just stay right here in the meantime.

 
**Anastasia**
No? I can't? Too bad...

 
**Anastasia**
But for the record, I've had some experience comforting wounded soldiers...

 
**Anastasia**
...so I have no issue with a man getting changed in front of me. Hehehe.

 
**Anastasia**
Of course.

 
**Anastasia**
...Well? What are you waiting for?
The sooner you're done, the better.

 
**Anastasia**
What, do you need a hand?
My, my, I guess I'm not the only princess here, hm?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess that's one way to say good morning...
 
**Anastasia**
Indeed. Good morning, Master.
Hehe, nothing fazes you, does it?

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Now then, today is our combat simulation day, right?
So let's get going.

 
**Anastasia**
Don't worry, Viy already set everything up.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Mind if I tweak some of those settings first?
 
**Anastasia**
Oh my. How could you even suggest such a thing?
(Crocodile tears)

 
**Anastasia**
No, I think we'll be leaving the settings right where they are, thank you very much.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And by “set everything up,” I assume you mean “more mischief”?
 
**Anastasia**
Why yes.

 
**Anastasia**
We always train in the same boring environments these days...

 
**Anastasia**
...so we decided to “mix it up” with some random data from the database.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Now then, come along.
The day's not getting any younger!

 
**Anastasia**
Oh my, I wonder where we'll end up first.
These random choices are so exciting.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's no possible way this can end well...


---
 
**P.A. System**
 
Beginning combat simulation in three, two, one...

 
**Anastasia**
Let's see. This looks like...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...So much lava...
 
**Anastasia**
So hot.

 
**Anastasia**
...I mean, it's fine. This is fine.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't you hot in here?
 
**Anastasia**
Who, me? Don't be silly.

 
**Anastasia**
So hot.

 
**Anastasia**
...What? I didn't say anything.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Ahem, ahem.

 
**Anastasia**
I must say, Master, it must be awfully difficult for you, having to prepare for combat in an environment like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. I'm used to it.
 
**Anastasia**
Teehee, you're a stubborn one, aren't you?

 
**Anastasia**
But you know...I actually prefer stubborn people over wishy-washy types.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You can say that again...
 
**Anastasia**
Oh, very well then.

 
**Anastasia**
I'll just have to cool you off a bit myself!
And by “cool you off” I mean freeze you solid!

 
**Anastasia**
What's that? Thanks, but you'll manage?
...Hmph, too bad.

 
**Anastasia**
You'd be surprised how much cooler your whole body will feel with just a mildly frozen nape.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Anyway, I assume we'll be attacked shortly, yes?
Let's see, where will the enemies come from...?

 
**Anastasia**
Huh? The lava?

 
**Anastasia**
Oh my... How did they all survive in there?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lava... Swimming... Khh, my head!
 
**Anastasia**
Master? Master! What happened?
You look white as driven snow!

 
**Anastasia**
What is it? Cyanosis? Anemia? A migraine?

 
**Anastasia**
Well, don't you worry. I might not look it, but I've actually worked as a nurse (or something similar) before!

 
**Anastasia**
And if I remember my training correctly, you should be fine as long as I keep performing CPR on your heart!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is... This is from that Halloween!
 
**Anastasia**
Halloween?

 
**Anastasia**
That's that festival Chaldea holds in autumn on an irregular basis, right?

 
**Anastasia**
Does that mean you last encountered Servants swimming in lava during Halloween?

 
**Anastasia**
...How does that work?

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Believe me, I wish I knew...


---
 
**Anastasia**
Ahem, ahem.

 
**Anastasia**
At any rate, I'll take care of them.

 
**Anastasia**
All you have to do, Master, is ensure I can make full use of my abilities as your Servant. Are we agreed?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Anastasia**
...
...

 
**Anastasia**
...So hot...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, we DID just fight while surrounded by lava...


---
 
**Anastasia**
Ugh!

 
**Anastasia**
Whose bright idea was it to set the combat simulator to an environment like this!?

 
**Anastasia**
Oh right! It was Viy!

 
**Anastasia**
Well, I've learned my lesson. From now on, I'll pay much closer attention when adjusting the simulator's settings.

 
**Anastasia**
Now come on, let's get out of here.
I can't stand this heat for a moment longer.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fine by me.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, let's go ahead and shut the simulator down then.


---
 
**Anastasia**
Thank you, Master.

 
**Anastasia**
...
...

 
**Anastasia**
...Well?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hang on. It'll just be a minute.


---
 
**Anastasia**
Well!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's weird...


---
 
**Anastasia**
It's sooo hooot!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All that squirming around is just gonna make you hotter!


---
 
**Anastasia**
Ghhh... But not moving makes the heat worse, too...

 
**Anastasia**
I know. Maybe some light conversation will serve as a distraction.

 
**Anastasia**
Let's see, what to talk about...
Say, how much do you know about me, anyway?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A little something, I'd say...
 
**Anastasia**
I see. Well, I'm happy to hear you've done your homework.

 
**Anastasia**
In that case, I'll skip ahead a bit.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nada.
 
**Anastasia**
Oh my. Well, that won't do at all.

 
**Anastasia**
Every good Master should know at least a little something about their Servants.

 
**Anastasia**
Very well then.

 
**Anastasia**
In that case, I will tell you about my background myself.

 
**Anastasia**
...But I'll keep it to under five minutes,
since it's so unbearably hot.

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's like nothing!
 
**Anastasia**
What do you expect?
I already mentioned the unbearable heat.

 
**Anastasia**
Now then. To begin, I was born into the title of Grand Duchess of the Romanov Dynasty...

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
...And that is how I died.

 
**Anastasia**
Oh yes, it was dreadful. Growing up, I never expected I would die in such a cruel manner.

 
**Anastasia**
Even now, I will never forget this grudge. If those soldiers' graves were within walking distance, I would march right over there, spit on them, and rub it into the dirt.

 
**Anastasia**
And yet, strangely enough...

 
**Anastasia**
Here in Chaldea, it all seems like a far-off, vaguely nostalgic dream.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does that mean you'd be glad to see humanity die off?
 
**Anastasia**
Ulp.

 
**Anastasia**
Well, um... Not always, but...
Maybe sometimes...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that a bad thing?
 
**Anastasia**
Good question...

 
**Anastasia**
I would say yes, but there is also a part of me that's glad for it...because it makes me feel like I'm practically a normal person.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Hmm...

 
**Anastasia**
I suppose, deep down, I still believe people are fundamentally good.

 
**Anastasia**
Not people like those barbaric soldiers, of course,
but people like my family.

 
**Anastasia**
...Which isn't to say I'm not aware that, historically speaking, my family did some rather dreadful things, too.

 
**Anastasia**
I know they lived, and grew up, and learned, and ate, and lived their lives like any other person would.

 
**Anastasia**
Or at least, I thought I did.

 
**Anastasia**
I'm still not sure if our people starving to death was my fault or my father's fault.

 
**Anastasia**
Or perhaps it was entirely Father and the government officials who swore loyalty to him who were to blame.

 
**Anastasia**
Maybe the things they did were simply so terrible that my family...

 
**Anastasia**
...Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and myself...

 
**Anastasia**
...all deserved to be hacked to pieces and dissolved in sulfuric acid.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't&ndash;


---
 
**Anastasia**
...(Sigh)

 
**Anastasia**
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up such unpleasant memories.

 
**Anastasia**
And besides, I know I will never find answers to those questions, no matter how long I look.

 
**Anastasia**
I just have to keep agonizing over them and looking back on them forever.

 
**Anastasia**
It's not right for me to expect you to answer them for me, Master.

 
**Anastasia**
Oh my, this won't do at all. If I don't snap out of it, I'm liable to end up being summoned as an Avenger.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah... I'd really prefer if that didn't happen.


---
 
**Anastasia**
Is that so? ...Hehe.
All right, Master, if you insist.

 
**Anastasia**
Let's see... I believe this is how you make an unbreakable promise in your homeland, yes?

 
**Anastasia**
I swear that I will never become an Avenger.
Pinky promise.

 
**Anastasia**
If this turns out to be a lie,
then cross my heart and hope to die.

 
**Anastasia**
...You know, I thought this would be a more lighthearted endeavor. I didn't realize quite how morbid it was until we got to the end.

 
**Anastasia**
Though admittedly, I'm still not sure how crossing one's heart could actually bring about one's death.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And I'm still not sure how one would actuallygo about crossing a heart at all.
 
**Anastasia**
Good point.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd just as soon not find out...
 
**Anastasia**
True. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Oh my, was that an earthquake? ...No, it couldn't be, could it? Hopefully, it's a sign that we'll get to leave soon.

 
**Anastasia**
I suppose this would never have happened in the first place if I hadn't encouraged Viy to play with the simulator's settings...

 
**Anastasia**
Then again, who's to say it wouldn't have?

 
**Anastasia**
Oh my. From the look on your face, I take it you don't believe it could have happened any other way?

 
**Anastasia**
Well, say what you will; my Viy is still adorable.
Especially his eyes when he has them both wide open.

 
**Anastasia**
Though I know some people have complained that he's scary, or shows up in their nightmares...

 
**Anastasia**
...or that they'd wish he'd stop glomming on to the backs of their heads.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me! I'M “some people”!


---
 
**Anastasia**
Hehehe, yes, I suppose you are, aren't you?

 
**Anastasia**
Still, you should know that Viy holds you in very high regard, even if he has his own way of showing&ndash;

 
**Anastasia**
It's freezing.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If it's not one thing, it's another!


---
 
**Anastasia**
What is this place?
It looks like...a prison made out of ice?

 
**Anastasia**
Well I've never seen anywhere like this before. Perhaps the system is “bugging out,” as they say. All right, shall we make our escape?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure, but how can we get this cell door open?
 


---
 
**Anastasia**
There we go. Now we can walk right out of here.

 
**Anastasia**
...Hm? Now why are you looking at me like that? Are you surprised that I would employ such a brutish method?

 
**Anastasia**
Well in case you need a reminder, I am the Grand Duchess of the holy Romanov Dynasty. Brute force is absolutely in my wheelhouse.

 
**Anastasia**
Now let's be on our way!

 
**Anastasia**
Oh my...

 
**Anastasia**
Now we're at a party hall?
It's just one surprise after another.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like there's food for the taking, too...


---
 
**Anastasia**
Hmm... Well, the flavor is nothing to write home about. And it doesn't seem to have replenished any of my magical energy.

 
**Anastasia**
Then again, perhaps that's only to be expected, since we are in a simulation and all... I suppose that makes this no different than eating mist.

 
**Anastasia**
And in that case, does that mean I've become a wise parsley, able to live off nothing but the faintest drops of dew?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Parsley? ...Ohhh, are you thinking of “sage”?'Cause if so, that kind of sage isn't a plant.


---
 
**Anastasia**
...I swear, English can be so difficult sometimes.

 
**Anastasia**
Why can't you all keep things simple and just speak Russian like civilized folk!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
From my perspective, I could say the same to you!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Right back at you, only in reverse!


---
 
**Anastasia**
...Fair enough.

 
**Anastasia**
On a different subject, I trust you're familiar with Jason the hero, yes?

 
**Anastasia**
And you're also familiar with the series of horror films starring an antagonist by the same name?

 
**Anastasia**
Well, can you even imagine our Jason running around with a shaved head and a hockey mask in place of that other Jason?

 
**Anastasia**
I certainly can't. The very idea of it gives me a huge case of the giggles.

 
**Anastasia**
I'm sure our Jason wouldn't be very happy to hear that...

 
**Anastasia**
...but the way I see it, if you can't be free to imagine whatever you like, then where can you be free?

 
**Anastasia**
...And on that note, it looks like Viy is doing his best to be considerate.

 
**Anastasia**
What's that? This is the opposite of being considerate?
Yes, you may be right.

 
**Anastasia**
Anyway, I suppose this is still a combat simulation,
so I won't feel too bad about crushing them.

 
**Anastasia**
Let's go, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Anastasia**
Phew, that's that.
I would say that battle went rather well.

 
**Anastasia**
Your orders were absolutely on point, Master.
Now then, shall we take our leave of this place?

 
**Anastasia**
...We CAN leave, can't we?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It'd be a really big deal if we couldn't.


---
 
**Anastasia**
Hehe.

 
**Anastasia**
Well, if we couldn't, I suppose we'd just have to throw a never-ending party here.

 
**Anastasia**
...Yes, that might have been the case.
Now that I think about it...

 
**Anastasia**
If we'd been left to our own devices, my family and I might have continued throwing endless parties forever.

 
**Anastasia**
We would have continued to eat, and learn, and grow, without ever growing tired of our day-to-day lives.

 
**Anastasia**
...All the while oblivious to the people starving to death right beneath our noses.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I don't think you can blame yourself for not noticing them.


---
 
**Anastasia**
...I suppose you're right.

 
**Anastasia**
People can only barely keep up with what's going on around them.

 
**Anastasia**
They're just not capable of seriously considering the plights of perfect strangers in the rest of the world.

 
**Anastasia**
If there was an exception to that rule...I guess it'd be the person I'm looking at right now.

 
**Anastasia**
...I take it from your expression that you have mixed feelings about that statement?

 
**Anastasia**
Yes, I know. It's very difficult to truly be concerned for others during peaceful, ordinary times.

 
**Anastasia**
But in your case, you still wouldn't hesitate to help anyone in your field of vision, would you?

 
**Anastasia**
I'm sure that way of life will bring you more than your share of headaches, but even so, I hope you never lose that spirit, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll do my best.
 
**Anastasia**
Good. That's all I ask.

 
**Anastasia**
Because I have every faith that your best will be more than enough.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...All right.
 
**Anastasia**
There's no need to think too hard about it.

 
**Anastasia**
Knowing you, I'm sure all you'll need to do is follow your heart. You can always rationalize your actions later.

 
**Anastasia**
In your case, I think that's all you'll need to be satisfied.

 


---
 
**Anastasia**
Now then, let's get out of here, Master.
Tomorrow is another day, after all.

 
**Anastasia**
Phew...

 
**Anastasia**
Say, Viy? Do you think there's something wrong with me?

 
**Anastasia**
I might be a Servant now thanks to meeting a creature as strange and mysterious as you...

 
**Anastasia**
...but do you think I'm really doing the best I can?
...I am, right?

 
**Narration:**
...My chest feels like it's filled with knives.
How can I be sickly, even though I'm a Servant?

 
**Narration:**
 
This pain... It's just like the pain I felt back then, when my family and I were lined up in that basement.

 
**Narration:**
 
But, that's impossible.

 
**Narration:**
 
Humanity has been restored. Everything should be headed towards a happy, peaceful ending.

 
**Narration:**
...Is that right?

 
**Narration:**
 
Something doesn't seem right. It feels like I've overlooked something important.

 
**Narration:**
...Who's there?

 
**Narration:**
 
Is that me?

 
**Narration:**
 
Hey, you. What is it you're doing there?

 
**Narration:**
...No way.

 
**Anastasia**
Huh?
Am I...sleeping?

 
**Anastasia**
Even though I'm a Servant?

 
**Anastasia**
 
...Was this your doing, Viy?

 
**Anastasia**
 
If this is your idea of mischief, it's not funny.
I'm very sensitive, remember?

 
**Anastasia**
Or what? Are you telling me...that's a scene from my future?

 
**Anastasia**
 
...
...

 
**Anastasia**
 
That's ridiculous.
No, that's not even possible.

 
**Viy**
&mdash;.
&mdash;.

 
**Anastasia**
...Nobody's coming.
Maybe this means Master isn't here.

 
**Anastasia**
...There's nobody here.

 
**Anastasia**
...!

 
**Anastasia**
Um... Who are you?

 
**Anastasia**
!

 
**Anastasia**
Enemies!

 
**???**
...No.

 
**Anastasia**
...?

 
**???**
We obey your orders.

 
**Anastasia**
Who are...
What are you talking about?

 
**???**
We will kill everyone here,
because that is what you want.

 
**Anastasia**
!

 
**Anastasia**
Master! Where are you!?
We're under attack!

 
**Anastasia**
...Master? Where are you?
Where is everyone...?

 
**Anastasia**
Khh...  Open your eyes, Viy!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Anastasia**
That's strange...

 
**Anastasia**
I don't remember the hallway...being this broken...

 
**Anastasia**
And...why is there nobody here?
...Master?

 
**Anastasia**
...Huh?

 
**Viy**
&mdash;.
&mdash;.

 
**Anastasia**
Viy? Do you remember when I was summoned?

 
**Anastasia**
...!

 
**Anastasia**
My head... It hurts...
No... Stop it, stop it, stop it!

 
**Narration:**
This isn't me!
It's not, it's not, it's not!!!

 
**???**
...Whose side are you on?

 
**Anastasia**
...!

 
**Narration:**
I know the answer to that.
Or maybe, I only thought I did?

 
**Narration:**
I can't tell.
I think things always feel like some hazy dream.

 
**Narration:**
It feels as though I'm suffering, then forgetting it all, then suffering, and then the whole thing just...repeats.

 
**Narration:**
...If only I'd never been born.

 
**Narration:**
It's with that lament that...
I wake up.

 
**Anastasia**
Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong, Anastasia?


---
 
**Anastasia**
Aah!
M-Master!?

 
**Anastasia**
I-I'm sorry. I must have fallen asleep.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup. You were sleeping like a baby.


---
 
**Anastasia**
C-come now, Master, don't tease me like that.
I'm supposed to be doing the teasing here, remember?

 
**Anastasia**
I am an imp, after all.

 
**Anastasia**
...And don't look at me like that.
This is perfectly fair.

 
**Narration:**
...Strange.
It feels like...we've had this conversation before.

 
**Anastasia**
Hey...Master?

 
**Anastasia**
I just had a bad dream.
A really, REALLY bad dream.

 
**Anastasia**
So, um... Would you mind holding my hand, Master?

 
**Anastasia**
Would you please hold my hand so that I don't go crazy or fall to pieces?

 
**Narration:**
Yes... I know. I do.

 
**Narration:**
 
I must still be dreaming.
I've been suffering from my guilt all this time.

 
**Anastasia**
...Master? I know I'm being a scaredy-cat now,
but would you please help me anyway?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm always here for you. Always.


---
 
**Anastasia**
Thank you...

 
**Narration:**
Still, I know the truth.

 
**Narration:**
I know there's still hope. I know tomorrow will always come. I know the future isn't a lost cause.

 
**Narration:**
And I know that...
because I know someone who taught me that.

 
**Narration:**
Someone strict, and cowardly, and stubborn... Someone utterly adorable who's probably staring up at the sky even as we speak.

 
**Narration:**
Thank you. I'm grateful to you.
So for now, I'm going to get just a little sleep.

 
**Narration:**
But I'll never stop waiting for you...because I believe that one day, this hand holding mine will be real.

 
**Narration:**
You're the only thing I truly believe in as I while away in this dark, almost frozen time...

 
**Narration:**
