# Diarmuid Ua Duibhne

<h2>Twin-Spear of the Rose</h2>

**Fou:**
Fou, Fou.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good Fou, good Fou

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Backrub, backrub)


---
 
**Fou:**
Foou...
(purr)

 
**Mash:**
Master, it seems like Diarmuid wants to talk to you.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Master, thank you for granting me an audience. I must say this army is fantastic.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is fantastic?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean?
 


---
 
**Diarmuid:**
How no one reacts to my face. Until now, I had to be careful merely walking around.

 
**Mash:**
Oh. I see, it's about your beauty mark, Diarmuid?

 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes, it's more like a curse than a mark of love. Nothing good ever came out of this beauty mark.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...Well, even though I did not have any regret about the love I felt because of it.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Apologies, we've strayed away from the subject. Master, what I want to talk about are my Noble Phantasms.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Currently, I'm using two Noble Phantasms...
“Gáe Dearg” and “Gáe Buidhe”&ndash;

 
**Diarmuid:**
But perhaps due to using two Noble Phantasms, neither one demonstrates its true potential.

 
**Diarmuid:**
In other words, their power is sealed.

 
**Diarmuid:**
If I can release their power somehow,
I think I could be a bigger help&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
I'm painfully aware of the feelings of not being able to fully utilize your Noble Phantasm.

 
**Mash:**
Why don't we have the Doctor investigate and see if there are any clues.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, so sealed Noble Phantasms...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Usually, there is some kind of clue in the era that the Heroic Spirit was living in, but&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm. I am not picking up anything.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It was such a long time ago when Diarmuid was alive... We may not be able to trace it completely...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Either way, there is a chance that you actually sealed the Noble Phantasms yourself.

 
**Mash:**
What do you mean?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It could be a malfunction during summoning, or the Servant is subconsciously restraining himself&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not really sure. But if you want to unleash his Noble Phantasm, why don't you just dive into his heart. It's risky though.

 
**Diarmuid:**
It's... Risky?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Because [♂ he /♀️ she] as your Master and several Servants have to tag along.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...
...

 
**Diarmuid:**
I cannot let my Master take a risk. I decline your suggestion.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's what he says. But what does Fujimaru want to do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We should go look. I'm sure it's fine.
 
**Diarmuid:**
Oh, Master! You are so generous. How lucky am I to serve under such a wonderful Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's see how awesome our man Diarmuid can be!
 
**Diarmuid:**
I'm flattered that you say that but... Why did you just call me “our man Diarmuid”...

 
**Diarmuid:**
I'm a little embarrassed.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fine. Well then, let's get ready.

 
**Diarmuid:**
So this is what my heart is like...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's your mental landscape. Diarmuid, you will lead us to finding clues about your Noble Phantasms.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Understood.
Well Master, let us proceed right away.

 
**Mash:**
Do you have any ideas where to?

 
**Diarmuid:**
Of course. I know this landscape very well. There is a forest nearby where I used to hunt.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...It's also the place we passed when I ran away with her.

 
**Mash:**
Her, does that mean&ndash;

 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes, exactly whom you think.
Gráinne... A woman I used to love.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...There are a few suspicious presences. Is this why you told us to come with Servants?

 
**Mash:**
Master, be careful.
There seems to be enemies.

 
**Mash:**
...They're coming!

 
**Diarmuid:**
I see. White blood cells, so to speak&ndash; Something like guardians of my own mental landscape.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I feel bad about destroying them, but I have no choice. I'm charging in. Come on!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Diarmuid:**
We are finished here!

 
**Mash:**
Yes. We got them all on our end, too.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I guess we are lucky the enemy was not formidable... Hmm?

 
**Mash:**
What happened?
The light was...

 
**Diarmuid:**
I see. I think I understand now.

 
**Diarmuid:**
By defeating the enemies in my mental landscape, the true brilliance of my Noble Phantasm is restored.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Master, I'm sorry to ask you but I would like to ask for your assistance a while longer.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Well, let's move onto the next spot.


**--ARROW--:**

**Diarmuid:**
This place... Well, although the furniture is different, it reminds me of the castle of the king I used to serve.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
By King... Do you mean Fionn mac Cumhaill?

 
**Diarmuid:**
...Yes, he is the one. This is the place I used to drink with the king and my fellows.

 
**Diarmuid:**
!?

 
**???:**
Diarmuid...

 
**Diarmuid:**
This voice... Are you the Knights of Fianna!?

 
**???:**
The king is not here.
Fionn mac Cumhaill is not here.

 
**???:**
The king is calling. If you don't see Fionn mac Cumhaill, the brilliance won't return.

 
**Diarmuid:**
The king is in this world?

 
**???:**
At the same time, we will stand in your way.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...You are threatening us.
What is going on?

 
**???:**
We are not your true allies.
We are mere gatekeepers within your mind.

 
**???:**
Though, our capabilities are exactly as you remember. Show us your skill, Diarmuid.

 
**???:**
The skill of someone who deserves to be called a Knight of Fianna in the past, and the future!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I guess we have to fight.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...Understood.
Master, please give me your orders!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's win!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's fight!
 


---
 
**Diarmuid:**
Understood! As you wish.
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne&ndash; Here I go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Diarmuid:**
My spear's brilliance has returned once again!

 
**Mash:**
One more should do it.
Let's keep going!


**--ARROW--:**

**Diarmuid:**
If the king is here, he should be in this forest...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bad memories?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You look glum.


---
 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes... This is the place where I died.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I came boar hunting with my king, Fionn mac Cumhaill, and I was killed by the boar&ndash; A demonic beast.

 
**Diarmuid:**
What happened after that, I don't need to tell you. I was not granted the king's healing.

 
**E：???:**
Certainly!
That's right, that's absolutely right, Diarmuid!

 
**Diarmuid:**
My king?

 
**Fionn:**
Yes, I'm your king, the all too perfect mac Cumhaill. But... Your attitude hasn't changed at all.

 
**Fionn:**
What a strange man you are. Don't you feel any hate towards me?

 
**Fionn:**
Yes. In this forest, at this place, I refused to share water after you had collapsed..

 
**Fionn:**
I could have saved you under the circumstances, yet I abandoned you on purpose, you see?

 
**Diarmuid:**
That is because of me&ndash;
It was my fault.

 
**Fionn:**
Hahahahaha. You are a truly loyal knight.
But I think that's a lie.

 
**Diarmuid:**
What?
No, it's not true!

 
**Fionn:**
You need not bite your thumb. I'm sure your new Master completely understands that.

 
**Fionn:**
For one thing&mdash; You don't regret it.

 
**Fionn:**
Even if you are summoned to a Holy Grail War somewhere, you'd not hope to overturn this unfortunate death.

 
**Fionn:**
If you trace the cause of this misfortune, it was actually caused by my queen, Gráinne.

 
**Fionn:**
You loved Gráinne, and you also reconciled with me.

 
**Fionn:**
Therefore, you should accept this ending&ndash;
That's what you are thinking, right?

 
**Diarmuid:**
O-Of course.
My king, I&ndash;

 
**Fionn:**
However, while you feel you weren't wrong, your true self regrets and resents!

 
**Fionn:**
Why did I not give you water back then?
Why did I not heal your wounds?

 
**Fionn:**
What should you have done back then, and such!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Augh... Shut up!
You are not the king!

 
**Fionn:**
Haha, correct! I'm a materialization of your resentment. What you were ashamed of and had sealed away&ndash;

 
**Fionn:**
The “something” that you cowered and ran away from, so you can keep pretending to be a knight.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...Augh!
These...are my true...feelings!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's fight together!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Things happen.
 


---
 
**Diarmuid:**
Master!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Right, doesn't matter who I was in the past, I'm a Servant now. My duty is to serve my new Master and eliminate the enemies.

 
**Diarmuid:**
O' Evil Fionn mac Cumhaill, created by my own mind. As a knight, it's my duty to kill you!

 
**Fionn:**
Ha! Nonsense, you are spineless!

 
**Fionn:**
Why don't you show me if your fragile heart can survive from being crushed by your own overwhelming guilt!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Fionn:**
&mdash;Yes. Yes I know of this.

 
**Fionn:**
Diarmuid, the resolution in your spears, the clarity of your art.

 
**Fionn:**
Our pride and joy,
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne's battle art.

 
**Fionn:**
Then, I only have one more thing to ask of you.
...Do you have any resentment, my knight?

 
**Diarmuid:**
...I must have some. But I will leave that here right now.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I have gained “something” more than that from my king. Something precious&ndash; Something I should not lose sight of.

 
**Fionn:**
Well done. Considering you tend to get lost, you found the correct answer quickly this time.

 
**Fionn:**
...Well, tendency to get lost is something I am guilty of myself.

 
**Fionn:**
...The powers of Gáe Dearg and Gáe Buidhe are properly released.

 
**Fionn:**
Move onward, Diarmuid. Grasp victory in your hand!

 
**Diarmuid:**
I appreciate it, King.
I do appreciate it...

 
**Diarmuid:**
My lord and Master. Thanks to you, my spears have returned to my hands.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I have no more hesitation. Using these twin spears, let us defeat our enemies.
