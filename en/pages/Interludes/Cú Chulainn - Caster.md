# Cú Chulainn - Caster

<h2>Sage of the Forest</h2>

**Mash**
Pure water and unpolluted air...
This is a calm forest, isn't it?

 
**Fou**
Fou, Foou♪

 
**Mash**
Do you feel that way, too, Fou? Even with the buzzing tree leaves and the chirping sound of birds,

 
**Mash**
for some reason, I think of only serenity.
Is it because there're no humans here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's pretty relaxing, huh?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is nice, isn't it?
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Forests are nice. Well, that's because animals and plants are singing the praises of life here.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Despite the bustle of people and other things, forests can stand up as forests solely by themselves.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
It's not the domain of people, in the first place. Though almost the entire earth is dominated by humans now.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Animals, plants, fairies, gods. Compared to those in the forest, humans are just "extras."

 
**Mash**
So, an uninvited guest.
Is that who we are&ndash;

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Umm?
No, it's not that stiff...

 
**Cú Chulainn**
...But how awful. The forest around here feels off.
I came here to take a look and the air is just too rough.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I didn't pick up anything here...
Is there really a distortion here, Cú Chulainn?

 
**Dr. Roman**
The Second Singularity, the 1st Century you guys fixed
&ndash;This is northeastern Ireland in that time period.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Sure, from the measurement there seems to be a delay in this era's correction. But is it a distortion?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Looking at the numbers, it just seems to be a quiet forest...

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I don't know about your situation but you shouldn't take forests lightly.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Forests have been around since before mankind.
They may even have been around from the Age of the Gods even before that.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Manipulating humans is exactly what it does best.
Just look at that.

 
**Werewolf**
GUUUUUUU...

 
**Mash**
A beast man monster!?

 
**Dr. Roman**
What? I-I didn't pick up anything here! Oh, but it looks like there's a slight trace of magical energy reaction...

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I'd bet it's part of this forest.
Anyway, I don't think it's here to welcome us.

 
**Werewolf**
GUUUUUUU!!

 
**Mash**
It's coming, Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for battle!!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Understood, Master!


**--BATTLE--**

**Cú Chulainn**
Cleaned up for the most part? You could say it was done as planned but rough, you know?

 
**Mash**
...Cú Chulainn. Do you have any idea about the distortion that's left in the 1st Century?

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Yeah, I do.
I'm Cú Chulainn, an Ulster hero, you know.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I'm not used to this calendar style called century, but, this is "my era."

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
True, come to speak of it.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, really!?
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai.
This is the era in which he was alive&ndash;

 
**Mash**
The specific period of Celt and Ulster legends are presumed to be from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Precisely. That said, the me that was alive already "died" decades ago by now.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
For some reason, I feel attached to this era.
I don't know why, I can just feel something.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Maybe that's also because I manifested as a Caster, oddly, I am more keen at picking up magical energy.

 
**Dr. Roman**
I see. That's why you were able to sense the distortion happening here in your hometown.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
My hometown, you say.
Still, I think it's because I'm a Caster.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
&ndash;It's the forest.

 
**Mash**
??

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I'm a Celtic, a man of Ulster.
If I'm a mage then that can only mean I became "that."

 
**Cú Chulainn**
A "Druid".

 
**Cú Chulainn**
The runes I use are originated from Norse legends, but Celtic mages are normally Druids.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Druids?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So Celtic shamans.
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai.
The Celtic priests are referred to as Druids.

 
**Mash**
They are people who have a deep relationship with the forest and monument, and can perform mystics same as the magecrafts we know.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Of course, they existed in my times, too.
However, I am not actually a Druid.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Like I said before, the type of magecraft I use is runes.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I combine the rune characters here and there and to perform the mystics.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
However, there's an exception.
When I manifested in this form&ndash;

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I obtained it as a "Noble Phantasm."
It was given to me since I was a Celtic mage.

 
**Mash**
...Wicker Man, the Cage of All-Consuming Flame.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Right. A Flame Noble Phantasm given to me after becoming a Celtic mage who could manipulate blazing heat.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Originally, it's a Noble Phantasm for Druids, since it was a magical tool used in sacrificial offerings.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
That's what summoned me here, telling me to stop the distortion.

 
**Dr. Roman**
Hmm?
You mean the distortion of this forest was&ndash;

 
**???**
...The forest won't die...

 
**???**
...All forests, without men...

 
**???**
...So, so they shall not be incinerated...

 
**???**
...The forest shall be preserved...

 
**???**
...Even if mankind ends up perishing...

 
**Mash**
!?

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Bingo! That's the one distorting this forest and preventing the correction of this era.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
That thing is a "Druid."
But also more than that.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Fearing the incineration of worlds, a cluster of madness.
A collection of dead souls who couldn't ascend to the Throne of Heroes.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
You actually thought you could kill me using a beast man?

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Hey, you guys!!
I'm talking to you!!

 
**Druid Ghost**
...The forest won't die...

 
**Druid Ghost**
...All forests will continue to be without mankind...!

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Silence, ghost! Be a man or fairy, you're a part of the forest if you live here!

 
**Cú Chulainn**
This lecture!
You guys are the ones who supposed to say it, right!!

 
**Mash**
A magical energy reaction approaching, Senpai!
An enemy is coming!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Exorcise the ghosts!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Prepare for battle!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Master!

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Take this as my kindness to you.
And be incinerated by the flames of Wicker Man!!


**--BATTLE--**

**Mash**
Victory confirmed.
The battle is over, Senpai.

 
**Fou**
Fou!

 
**Cú Chulainn**
...Gosh.
My job is over at this point then.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
Time to go home now.
Thanks for coming with me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wanna check out Ulster?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wanna go see your friends?
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn**
I'll pass.
Sure, I'd like to meet up with some people but, well&ndash;

 
**Cú Chulainn**
You know, I'm a mage now.
Who knows what could happen if I went back like this?

 
**Dr. Roman**
Right, because Druids hold a very special position in the Celtic cultural world, you know?

 
**Dr. Roman**
If the hero, Cú Chulainn, who was supposed to be dead, comes back as a Druid,

 
**Dr. Roman**
then there'll be a huge uproar.
I bet a bunch of countries will rise and fall!

 
**Cú Chulainn**
That's right.
So, well, this is it.

 
**Cú Chulainn**
I got to breathe in some nostalgic air.
Nice. Let's go back now?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go back!
 


---
 
**Mash**
Yes, Senpai!
