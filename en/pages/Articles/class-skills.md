### Magic Resistance
A Skill of the [Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Shielder, Ruler, Watcher] class, granting protection from magical effects.
[EX]: This rank of Magic Resistance averts spells targeting the holder entirely, rather than just canceling them. 
[A]: No matter what kind of high level magecraft they may be, spells of insufficient strength cannot touch the holder. They are practically invincible by the standards of modern magi.
[B]: It cancels spells with a chant below three verses, leaving it difficult for the holder to be affected by most magecraft, even if targeted by High Magecraft or Greater Rituals.
[C]: It cancels spells with a chant below two verses, but cannot defend against magecraft on the level of High Magecraft or Greater Rituals.
[D]: Only enough to cancel Single-Action spells.
[E]: Such an abysmal rank can’t actually cancel spells at all, but it does somewhat reduce magical damage.

### Independent Action
A Skill of the [Archer, Faker] class, the ability to function without a Master's support.
[EX]: One’s existence is almost similar to a human’s at this rank, as they don’t face resistance from the World or require magical energy to manifest.
[A+]: A Master is almost completely unnecessary. Even if the Holy Grail War has ended, the holder is able to maintain themselves for a potentially indefinite amount of time.
[A]: The holder is able to take action by themselves and survive for a week without a Master, but they’d still require backup to use their Noble Phantasm.
[B]: So long as the holder conserves their magical energy, they’re able to survive for around two days without a Master.
[C]: Without a Master’s support, the holder can only survive for a day on their own.
[E-]: It’s impossible for one of this rank to act on their own, so they’re only able to stick around for half an hour.

### Riding
A Skill of the [Saber, Rider, Shielder] class, one's ability to handle mounts and vehicles.
[EX]: At this rank, one can ride pretty much anything.
[A+]: Even Phantasmal and Divine Beasts can be handled as mounts. This doesn’t apply to dragonkind though.
[A]: Almost anything at all can be handled, excluding Phantasmal or Divine Beasts.
[B]: Most mounts and vehicles can be handled with above average Skill, including ones that didn’t even exist during the holder’s lifetime. They still can’t handle the likes of a Phantasmal Species though.
[C]: Most normal mounts and vehicles can be handled with average skill.
[E]: A rank indicative of one’s utter inexperience with all manner of mounts.

### Territory Creation
A Skill of the [Caster] class, the ability to build a personal domain that collects mana from the land.
[EX]: No matter where they are, the holder is able to set up an impressive and completely unique kind of territory all on their own.
[A+]: An impressive rank denoting that one can quickly set up a specialized territory of considerable quality.
[A]: One can build a “temple,” a large structure that is vastly superior to a normal magus’ workshop.
[B]: A “workshop” is an absolute necessity for any self-respecting magus, and it’s at this rank that one can be built.
[C]: Creating something the size of an average workshop isn’t easy, but a smaller, more personal domain is still possible.
[D]: Only a very small area can become one’s territory.

### Item Construction
A Skill of the [Caster] class, one's ability to create objects both magical and mundane in nature
[EX]: Having it at this rank either means that one is able to create a truly vast amount of items, or that they’re able to create one type of item with extraordinary quality.
[A]: The holder is able to manufacture a wide array of objects—perhaps even something as extravagant as a potion of limited immortality.
[B+]: Though the quality of one’s works are impressive, their variety is limited.
[B]: Various tools and objects are among the holder’s specialties.
[C]: The holder is really only able to create one or two kinds of items.

### Presence Concealment
A Skill of the [Assassin] class, the ability to hide oneself. 
[EX]: Seeing an existence on this level is virtually impossible—and if you do, it’s likely too late.
[A+]: Even other Servants will have trouble detecting the holder, as they’re able to become almost completely imperceptible. Taking offensive action still drops it considerably.
[A]: One is able to hide themselves well enough to be nearly undetectable, but even so, its rank will still fall if the holder makes a hostile move.
[B]: It’s extremely difficult for the holder to be detected once they’ve disappeared. Its rank decreases if one attempts an attack.
[C]: Even if one’s hidden themselves the best that they can, this is a rank that’s really only suitable for spying, as an attack would be extremely obvious.
[D]: A rank unbecoming of an Assassin, as though it’s still barely suitable for spying, an enemy Servant could infer their presence almost immediately.

### Mad Enhancement
A Skill of the [Berserker] class, increasing one's parameters in exchange for their sanity.
[EX]: Though one’s parameters are increased, they possess a uniquely volatile and strange state of mind.
[A+]: All parameters are increased, but every shred of what could be called a “normal” mind has been lost.
[A]: All parameters are increased, but almost all of one’s reason has been robbed from them.
[B]: All parameters are increased, but most of the holder’s sanity has been taken away.
[C]: All parameters except Magic and Luck are increased, but their sanity is skewed.
[D]: Strength and Endurance are increased, but one’s ability to think clearly is hazy and imperfect.
[E]: While one’s parameters are left as-is, so is their natural sanity. Some might still have a particular “trigger,” however.
[E-]: The holder’s sanity is left completely intact, but of course, this also means they don’t receive any parameter increases whatsoever.

### Territory Defense
A Skill of the [Shielder] class, reducing the damage done to allies within a certain range of the holder.
[C]: Though one's allies have their defense increased, the user isn't included in that boost.

### True Name Discernment
A Skill of the [Ruler] class, sight that automatically reveals the status information of other Servants. A Luck check is necessary to bypass abilities that conceal such things, however. **There’s no information regarding what different ranks give, but I assume it denotes how much information the Ruler sees.**
[B]: Jeanne, Amakusa
[C]: Karl

### Divine Judgement
A Skill of the [Ruler] class, the privilege to use Command Seals against other Servants. In a Grail War, the summoned Ruler is granted two Command Seals per each participating Servant. **There’s no information regarding what different ranks give, but I assume it denotes the strength of the Ruler’s commands.**
[A]: Jeanne
[B]: Karl
[C]: Amakusa
[—]: Amakusa during Apocrypha. None of the Command Seals he was given were valid for the current Holy Grail War, so this Skill was useless.

### Avenger
A Skill of the [Avenger] class, the existence of an Anti-Hero who converts the hatred and resentment others feel towards them into a temporary power increase. **There’s no information regarding what different ranks give, but I assume it denotes how much one’s power is able to increase, and the speed at which it does so.**
[EX]: Space Ishtar
[A]: Angra, Alcides, Dantes, Lobo
[B]: Jalter, Gorgon, Castor
[C]: Salieri

### Oblivion Correction
A Skill of the [Avenger] class, the constant state of one who will never forget the wrongs they've suffered. **There’s no information regarding what different ranks give, but as its function is to “increase critical hit effectiveness,” I assume the rank denotes how strongly it does so.**
[A]: Jalter, Angra
[B]: Dantes, Lobo, Salieri
[C]: Gorgon, Castor

### Self-Replenishment (Mana)
A Skill of the [Avenger] class, a need for retribution that causes one's magical energy to endlessly surge forth.
[A+]: Jalter. The amount of magical energy is higher than it normally would be, because she’s been spawned by a wish on the Holy Grail.
[A]: Gorgon
[B]: Lobo
[C]: Salieri, Maou
[D]: Dantes, Castor
[E]: Angra. Recovers only a miniscule amount of energy every minute.

### Counter Hero
A Skill of the [Savior] class, causing parameter reductions in Heroic Spirits who face te holder in combat. However, it isn't as effective on Anti-Heroes. 
[B]: Reduces the parameters of enemy Heroic Spirts by two ranks, and reduces the parameters of Anti-Heroes by one rank.

### Camouflage
A Skill of the [Faker] class, allowing one to disguise their status information.
[B]: Iskandar’s Shadow. At this rank, one’s class and parameters can be obfuscated.

### Territory Infringement
A Skill of the [Watcher] class, allowing one's prying eyes to bypass the magical barriers and territories established to keep others out. **DISCLAIMER! Though this is based on what we’ve seen Watcher do in SF combined with what the name itself implies, Territory Infringement lacks a proper description.**
[A]: Watcher

### Entity of the Outer Realm
A Skill of the [Foreigner] class, denoting the holder's connection to a realm beyond man's comprehension. **It doesn’t seem to impart any special effect, and merely denotes the strength of one’s foreign connection.**
[EX]: Abby, Hokusai, Yang
[A]: Van Gogh
[B]: Summer BB. Her eyes “just happened to meet” those of an Outer God, and from that a contract was made.
[C]: Voyager (FGO)
[D]: MHXX
