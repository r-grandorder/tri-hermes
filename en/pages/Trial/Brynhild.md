# Trial Quest - Brynhild

## Our Beloved Hero (Human)
 
**???:**
&mdash;Good morning. Are you awake, my dear Sigurd? 
 
**A：???:**
Ah, you're finally awake. Good morning. Morning has arrived even upon Hindarfjall. 
 
**A：???:**
The sun is shining, the little birds are chirping at one another... such a wonderful morning...but not really. 
 
**A：???:**
I am certain that the doom of Chaldea will be here. The world will burn to ashes. 
 
**A：???:**
Yet still, you stand to face it. For the ceaseless tomorrows, for the ever-coming tomorrows. 
 
**A：???:**
...Good morning. I shall be accompanying you for a very short while. 
 
**A：???:**
My name, let me see...Companion... Valkyrie...No...no. Now, though, yes. 
 
**A：???:**
&mdash;Call me Mash. 
 
**A：???:**
You see, as I am now, call me Mash. My adorable, shining, and fleeting Master.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? But you are...
 
**Mash:**
...Ah, yes. Now I remember. It seems you have some degree of resistance. 
 
**Mash:**
Then I have no choice but to do this. I'm sorry. To be honest, I want you to be just the way you are. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm...sorry. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know your real name, but I do know...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, you're right... Even though this is the end of time, you... 
 
**Mash:**
...You have not shown weakness in your mind. Even now, you can think of others... 
 
**Mash:**
A beautiful heart. A strong heart. I believe that was once what I loved. 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry, now...for just a short while, I will touch your lips. With these fingertips. 
 
**Mash:**
It's all right. There is no need to worry... Yield to the rune. 
 
**Mash:**
...There. It's finished. 
 
**Mash:**
How do you like it? You know my name, my hero, my Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash.
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm pretty sure it was Mash.
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Master. My adorable Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
All right&mdash;let's Rayshift together again today. My hero. To save the world. 
 
**Mash:**
...There is still some left. The Demonic Fog, that is. 
 
**Mash:**
The way things are... There are still traces from the Fourth Era that are yet to be repaired. 
 
**Mash:**
Demonic Fog. Life-stealing death mists that are packed with magical energy. Like the atmosphere during the Age of the Gods. 
 
**Mash:**
If it's the end of the 19th century AD... The atmosphere should be close to that of 20th century Tokyo... 
 
**Mash:**
However, you might call this a tragedy... As this is the last island left with ancient mystics... 
 
**Mash:**
...Industrial...revolution... ...The people who brought about the evolution of civilization... 
 
**Mash:**
...I can't believe these people will be slain in this way. What a cruel, ironic punishment. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you all right, Mash?
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're looking awfully pale.
 
---
 
**Mash:**
Ah... 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Ahh&mdash; 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry for causing you this trouble&mdash; Apparently I was affected by the Demonic Fog. I... 
 
**Mash:**
I can't believe... I allowed myself to be so shamefully overcome... 
 
**Mash:**
To be caught in one's arms... by a human child...by you...I'm sorry... 
 
**Mash:**
Ohh... Dear, me...Your...your... 
 
**Mash:**
...Your...hand. It is so warm... 
 
**Mash:**
But Sigurd's hands had been so cold... but now, you're...so warm... 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Wait! I'm sorry. I'll step back. When we touch each other too much, it rattles me. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm so flustered... Your warmth makes the flame inside me grow strong. 
 
**Mash:**
Before my flames burn you to ashes, allow me to test you. Allow me to learn what kind of person you are. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Your flames will burn me to ashes?
 
**Mash:**
... 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How are you going to test that
 
**Mash:**
...You'll see... soon enough. 
 
---
 
**D：???:**
 
**Mash:**
You heard that, right? It reached you, right? That is the destiny which you must face. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Someone is fighting within the Demonic Fog!?
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It sounds like a Helter Skelter!
 
---
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Oh! How beautiful! Such a lovely Valkyrie! 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Rejoice, my brawny Berserker friend, help tantamount to an army has come to assist! 
 
**Beowulf:**
You idiot! That is a maiden of Heorot. Her beauty is questionable. Getting involved with her is trouble. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Hey! It's not as if I'm going to die here, nor do I have any business in your manor. 
 
**Beowulf:**
So don't you wander up to us like tha... I see, so you've already been stopped by a mistletoe. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Then I guess you're of no harm to us... Whoa! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Two Heroic Spirits?
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They are fighting the machines?
 
---
 
**Beowulf:**
Why yes, I'll crush the enemies I see before me. That's all I am doing here. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Hahaha! Whatever the era, wherever the location, there is only one road for the honorable Knights of Fianna! 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Namely, the path of righteousness! Destroy evil! Protect humans! Honor first shines upon those that shepherd in eternal peace! 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
I hold no grudges. No, never! I am a man of endless generosity! 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
When the isle of Britain is Erin's, there too I shall equally display righteousness. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Ahh&mdash;How logical and bright! What's more, this unrivaled, handsome young man is at his peak! What could be better!? 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
When a person is shining, he must shine to his fullest. Wouldn't you agree there, Berserker? 
 
**Beowulf:**
It seems our interests are similar but completely different in nature. However, it's true that we are both greedy in our desires. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Precisely! We speak of what we want, and we mercilessly pummel enemies that get in the way! It's what heroes are made of! 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
I don't get along with you in the least, but it seems to me that we are essentially of the same breed. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
This seems to be a rare place where our paths have crossed. Hahahahaha! This is an excellent omen! 
 
**Beowulf:**
You said it. As long as we have the power to crush our enemies, then it's all good. 
 
**Beowulf:**
&mdash;Hey! You there, Master, and your companion. 
 
**Mash:**
Companion&mdash; He called me a companion... That person seems like a very good Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Beowulf:**
What did you come here for? If you're wandering through these mists, then you're certainly not a pitiful citizen of London. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Let me ask you again, what have you come here for? 
 
**Mash:**
...I take back my previous statement... That was the question I wanted to ask, horrible beast. 
 
**Mash:**
I have a question for you as well, ageless, fleeting, and shining one. Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
What is it you are doing, as we continue to Rayshift, today, tomorrow, and forever? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Fight.
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Someday save the world.
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know...what to say. 
 
**Mash:**
You are too radiant and glorious... When I gaze upon you shining so brightly... 
 
**Mash:**
I...in this very moment have decided... even though I am here... 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;No, no! To battle, Fujimaru. You will achieve victory. Because I am at your side. 
 
**Mash:**
Even if we didn't have the protection of god, even if we didn't have the protection of this world... 
 
**Mash:**
I, for this time alone, will grant you the protection of a great Valkyrie warrior&mdash; 
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Beowulf:**
&mdash;What a ridiculous fight. If I'm gonna get in a punching match it should be with a Servant. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
You mean several, right? The more powerful the enemies are, the more joy there is in defeating them, and the greater the profit. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Profit? Who needs that? It's unnecessary. Do you take money from a woman after sex? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Just forget it. There'll be no more killing here. Farewell, nameless Master. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Well, well. He was a formidable warrior to the very end. True, he was strong, but I'm sure he would've run out of enemies to defeat. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
It goes to show that I need not have worried. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
In fact, you resemble my own subordinates. You've made me feel a little parental affection, or should I say, kingly affection. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
&mdash;Yes. Now let me address the lovely lady over here! 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
In this fight with the speechless iron knights and dolls, you displayed magnificent heroism. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Therefore, a romance with this battle maiden seem inevitable... If I had the time, I would certainly go through with it, but... 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
It seems this materialization is but a temporary one, I am destined to return to my former battlefield. 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
What a pity. When it comes right down to it, I am too impatient to remain here any longer... 
 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Yes, I must end the boredom here! Farewell, young Master! Away! 
 
**Mash:**
Alas... 
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know...what to do... 
 
**Mash:**
Humans leave only destruction in their wake, yet even in these times, you, my hero, resist. 
 
**Mash:**
You can stand side-by-side with the dragon slayer Beowulf. You can fight alongside the god slayer Fionn mac Cumhaill. 
 
**Mash:**
When I see you like that, I... I... 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;I really don't know what to do. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why don't you know what to do?
 
**Mash:**
When you are so heroic... I can't help...but to...love you... 
 
**Mash:**
I love, I love, I love you. I love, I love, I love, I love you... 
 
**Mash:**
...I end up...loving you... 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not sure what to say
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm...sorry... ...I really will...be more careful. 
 
**Mash:**
I will be more careful... 
 
---
 
**Mash:**
...But, ohh... No, no. You make me so flustered, that, ohh... 
 
**Mash:**
All I can do is show you who I am. Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
My true name is Brynhild. Yes, that is the truth. I am not Mash Kyrielight. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? What the... Really?
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
As I thought, you aren't Mash.
 
---
 
**A：Brynhild:**
...Yes. 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
I was the Valkyrie, the machine, who assisted the great god Odin of northern Europe, yet was transformed into a human woman and met my death. That is I. 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
Please forgive me. Due to who I was in life, I cannot help but see into your soul... 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
Therefore, I have come to a decision. My father, Odin... I cannot be your daughter... 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
I will be a woman carved into human history, I will be a hero's companion. 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
...Alas, these cries are from the Demons. This is the final summoning of the last vestiges of the Demonic Fog. 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
They may have even been guided to us by the damnable blue flame. Either way... 
 
**A：Brynhild:**
...How dare they...interrupt...what I want to say! 
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Brynhild:**
&mdash;Ahh, I killed it. 
 
**Brynhild:**
The vile enemy that stood between us is dead. It's all over now. 
 
**Brynhild:**
How unfortunate... But, yes, this may be for the best. 
 
**Brynhild:**
If I remain with you any longer, I would surely... be in greater and greater trouble... 
 
**Brynhild:**
...Therefore, let us part for now. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Will we meet again?
 
**Brynhild:**
Yes, yes. Until that day... 
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll meet again.
 
**Brynhild:**
...That's right. Someday, when the stars align and our paths cross... 
 
---
 
**Brynhild:**
Take care, and stay healthy, my fleeting and fragile, but strong and stout, beloved human child. 
 
**Brynhild:**
I'm sure that when we meet again, I'll be of assistance. 
 
**Brynhild:**
&mdash;Farewell. You're the world's newest hero, my Sigurd.
