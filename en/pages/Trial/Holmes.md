# Trial Quest - Sherlock Holmes

## A Discoverer, A Revealer, A Detectiveーーーor maybe An Arbitrator
 
**Holmes:**
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
**Holmes:**
I am Sherlock Holmes, world-renowned investigator, and the world's only consulting detective. 
 
**Holmes:**
I am both the origin and a conglomeration of the very concept of a detective, and I represent all those who shine light on the truth. 
 
**Holmes:**
I shall have the pleasure of leading you to new mysteries and new truths. 
 
**Holmes:**
In consequence of a variety of very particular circumstances, I have manifested as a Servant and have, for the time being, taken up residence in Chaldea. 
 
**Holmes:**
I cannot claim to be utilizing my detective skills to their utmost...but I am still myself, unchanged. 
 
**Holmes:**
The only difference now is that rather than my accustomed seat in my room situated in 221B Baker Street, I presently find myself on Chaldea's multipurpose sofa. 
 
**Holmes:**
...Or so I say. 
 
**Holmes:**
I gather that for some of you, this is our first meeting, while there are others among you who have long been familiar with my history and skills. 
 
**Holmes:**
If you are the former... Hmm, let's see...simply think of what you are about to witness as memories from the shadows of the future. 
 
**Holmes:**
...or a dream, if you like. Though, lamentably, I am unable to intervene in dreams. 
 
**Holmes:**
Which is to say: this is not a dream. 
 
**Holmes:**
Now then. Let us begin. 
 
**Holmes:**
Have you ever read the most excellent and famous detective mysteries that feature Sherlock Holmes as their main character? 
 
**Holmes:**
Each features the detective solving various mysteries, set in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
 
**Holmes:**
The stories are frequently adapted to film and other media. Surely you have at least heard of them. 
 
**Holmes:**
...And so, seeing me manifest here as Holmes, one imagines you wondering: 
 
**Holmes:**
“Was Sherlock Holmes an actual individual? Wasn't he a man of fiction?” 
 
**Holmes:**
Indeed. Curious. Very curious. 
 
**Holmes:**
Am I the manifestation of the character in the stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? 
 
**Holmes:**
Or did the great detective Holmes really exist, and were the stories based on the events of his life? 
 
**Holmes:**
...In other words, were the stories written by Sir Conan Doyle adapted from the biography by Watson? 
 
**Holmes:**
This must be a great puzzle to you all as well. I had meant to bring this up one of these days. 
 
**Holmes:**
This time around, the story is not about the Incineration of Humanity, nor its restoration. 
 
**Holmes:**
The story is about yours truly. 
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. Did you get a good night's rest? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Morning, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, hello. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I rested well. Thanks.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
It appears Mister Holmes has something to discuss with us this morning. Something about the battle simulator for training... 
 
**Holmes:**
Good morning, Fujimaru. You have arrived at precisely the moment I anticipated. 
 
**Holmes:**
As Miss Kyrielight mentioned, I would like you to accompany me to the simulator for an experiment. 
 
**Holmes:**
The item I requested from Sir Babbage has finally been completed. I would like you to try it out. 
 
**Mash:**
An item, you say? 
 
**Holmes:**
An explanation would be a simple thing, but it would be far better to experience it. 
 
**Holmes:**
It's not Rayshifting per se, so there's no need to be nervous. I would, however, advise you not to let your guard down. 
 
**Holmes:**
Some battle is to be expected, of course. Let us begin. 
 
**Mash:**
Um, excuse me, Mister Holmes! Senpai hasn't finished changing into the proper Mystic Code...! 
 
**Holmes:**
Yes, I have already accounted for that and made the necessary adjustments. This is not a standard Rayshift, so it is easy enough for me to control such minor details. 
 
**Holmes:**
Now, let us begin. Begin simulation! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai. Senpai, can you hear me? 
 
**Mash:**
Good, we're connected. I'm glad. This feels more like a Rayshift than a simulation. 
 
**Mash:**
So where...exactly is this place? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did the simulator always have a stage like this?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This seems familiar... Or maybe not so much...
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Well, it doesn't ring a bell to me. 
 
**Mash:**
Normally, the simulator creates stages based on locations we've visited in Rayshifts. 
 
**Mash:**
But, this is...wireframe...? 
 
**Holmes:**
To use the parlance of science fiction, you might call it cyberspace. In that it is virtual reality, it's not much different from the simulator... 
 
**Holmes:**
But behold! Thanks to the program that Sir Babbage created, we are inside Chaldea's computer system! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So in the end, it's cyberspace.
 
**Mash:**
Inside the computer system!? Does that mean you two are digitized? 
 
**Holmes:**
Correct. Though, only our consciousnesses in this case. The technology necessary to digitize the physical body has still yet to be created. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This place really does seem familiar...
 
**Mash:**
Senpai? 
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Allow me to explain. The Simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe's internal memory. 
 
**Holmes:**
I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it... 
 
**Holmes:**
But it has given us quite a fight. And so, I requested the mathematical genius Sir Babbage to help us out. 
 
**Mash:**
Um, wouldn't it have been easier for Babbage to work on it himself...? 
 
**Holmes:**
I wanted to see for myself. Certain aspects of the venture tickled my fancy. 
 
**Holmes:**
So I asked Sir Babbage to do the impossible task of creating a program to hack in. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see?
 
**Holmes:**
Do you understand now? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So what's the point of me and Mash being here?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, solving mysteries... While I certainly derive a certain satisfaction from solving them myself without anyone ever knowing... 
 
**Holmes:**
I had the opportunity to invite you along and took it so that I might provide a bit of commentary while I went about solving this mystery. 
 
**Holmes:**
And I simply could not do that were I alone, now, could I? 
 
**Mash:**
So...because you wanted to comment on it... Well, it is true that when a great detective solves a mystery, an audience is an absolute necessity! 
 
**Mash:**
We have front row seats to Mr. Holmes's commentary, Senpai! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yay!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's cool and all, but it's REALLY early...

---
 
**Holmes:**
Indeed. And there is also the possibility of battle. I am not entirely certain that my new Spirit Origin can handle it alone. 
 
**Mash:**
A new Spirit Origin? 
 
**Mash:**
Mister Holmes...didn't you mention that you manifested as a Caster? 
 
**Holmes:**
Well, you'll soon see. 
 
**Holmes:**
Now then. Let's proceed, shall we? The node with the data mass in question is ahead. 
 
**Holmes:**
I would have liked to appear immediately in front of the data mass, but the target node is well-protected. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Protection?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So it's the usual you-know-what...?

---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An all-too-familiar howl!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I knew it!
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I'm detecting an enemy! 
 
**Mash:**
...Huh? But you're inside Chaldea's mainframe... 
 
**Mash:**
You're in a computer...and yet I’m detecting a response from an enemy that actually has magical energy!? 
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, as expected. 
 
**Mash:**
Mister Holmes!? 
 
**Holmes:**
While we are indeed in the simulator, I should warn you that the battle we now face will be more real than a simulation. 
 
**Holmes:**
Any injuries you sustain will likely affect your physical body in reality. Proceed with caution. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll be fine.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yep. Saw this coming.
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, that is certainly reassuring. Let us hold nothing back. 
 
**Mash:**
...Target approaching rapidly! Please be careful, Senpai! 
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Battle has ended. I'm not detecting any other enemies in your vicinity. 
 
**Mash:**
Good work, Senpai. ...Senpai? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Holmes...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Bare-knuckle boxing?
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Now that you mention it...! 
 
**Mash:**
Mister Holmes did use a special...facade in previous battles, saying there was an issue with his Spirit Origin. 
 
**Mash:**
But this time...his appearance didn't change during battle! 
 
**Mash:**
And he fought with his bare hands! Could that possibly be the famed, mysterious martial arts style... 
 
**Mash:**
...that Mister Holmes utilized...taken directly from the stories of Sir Conan Doyle!? 
 
**Mash:**
Baritsu! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Baritsu!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What kind of martial art is that!?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
I haven't used Baritsu for a long time, but it is quite a thrill. Hm? What's the matter, Miss Kyrielight? 
 
**Holmes:**
And with you, Master? As my Master, shouldn't Baritsu be familiar to you? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, I don't know Baritsu.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, what? “Master”!?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Ah yes, I suppose I neglected to mention that. 
 
**Holmes:**
I have officially become a Servant of Chaldea, and formed a contract with you. I did so last night. 
 
**Holmes:**
We already had a connection, so it was only a matter of time... The rest... Well, a variety of circumstances and changes have taken place. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait a minute, your Class...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-is the label of Ruler a typo...?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, yes. I mentioned I was a Caster. Forgive me. I lied. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Mash:**
A...lie...? M-Mister Holmes...that's...um...well... 
 
**Holmes:**
A jest. My apologies. I couldn't help myself. Allow me to explain in all seriousness. 
 
**Holmes:**
When I officially became a Servant of Chaldea, my Spirit Origin changed...significantly, much to my surprise, as I am sure you can imagine. 
 
**Holmes:**
I was, most assuredly, a Caster before. But as of now, I am Sherlock Holmes, Ruler. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You turned into a Ruler!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So that wasn't a typo!
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Ruler, Sherlock Holmes! 
 
**Mash:**
I see, so that's how it is! 
 
**Mash:**
Since he is a great detective who has solved many difficult cases, it may indeed be appropriate to call Holmes a peacemaker or a mediator. 
 
**Mash:**
No, I should not even say “may” in this case! I should say instead that this was very likely to happen! 
 
**Mash:**
In the past, Jeanne, Martha, and Amakusa Shirou all told me the following: 
 
**Mash:**
In the case of Heroic Spirit summoning based on the Holy Grail, only actual saints could be summoned as Rulers... 
 
**Mash:**
But Chaldea's summoning system is not bound by such rules. 
 
**Holmes:**
Curious. Very curious. A detective ought to seek the truth and lay it bare. 
 
**Holmes:**
To make a ruling should be the job of a judge or a jury. My goodness... 
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Mash:**
By the way...there's something that's been bothering me... 
 
**Holmes:**
What is it? 
 
**Mash:**
The man who was Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest detective and one and only consulting detective... 
 
**Mash:**
May I ask a question? This has been on my mind for the longest time... 
 
**Mash:**
Mister Sherlock Holmes, which exactly...are you? 
 
**Holmes:**
By “which,” you mean...? 
 
**Mash:**
Um... 
 
**Mash:**
I believe you, Mister Holmes, know exactly what I am asking you. 
 
**Holmes:**
Indeed. But as it happens, I would like you to say the words this time. Actually, it need not come from Miss Kyrielight herself... 
 
**Holmes:**
Master. You have the same question in mind, correct? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you really exist, historically I mean?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you only a fictional character?
 

---
 
**Mash:**
That's it! That was what I was curious about... 
 
**Mash:**
At first, when I met you, all I could think was, “The great detective really did exist!” And I simply accepted that fact. 
 
**Mash:**
Thinking about it, though... I'm not really sure. I've never heard the truth from you, Mister Holmes. 
 
**Mash:**
On top of that, I recall you making contradictory statements about whether or not you are fictional... 
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, I see. 
 
**Holmes:**
I anticipated that this question would come up one day, and so I cannot say I am surprised. It is, after all, a perfectly reasonable question. 
 
**Holmes:**
But Miss Kyrielight. Fujimaru. 
 
**Holmes:**
If you do ask outright, things may grow more complicated. Would you mind that? 
 
**Mash:**
Hm...? 
 
**Holmes:**
Greek mythological heroes such as Heracles and the witch Medea... Karna and Arjuna from Indian mythology... 
 
**Holmes:**
Celtic heroes, the knights from the Legend of King Arthur, Charlemagne's famous paladins, the giant-killing Beowulf... 
 
**Holmes:**
The four retainers of Raikou who slayed the demon spider Tsuchigumo... Many myths and legends spoke of these heroes and great men and women... 
 
**Holmes:**
Let us say for the moment that I am indeed a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. What, then, is to say that the individuals I mentioned are not similar creations? 
 
**Holmes:**
I was created during the time when Doyle wrote his stories, but many heroes of legend were created by people writing stories long after their respective moments in time. 
 
**Holmes:**
For example, Siegfried's story found in the Poetic Edda, while set in the 5th century, was not completed until after the 8th century. 
 
**Holmes:**
Karna and Arjuna's story is set somewhere around 5000 B.C. The text itself, however, was completed sometime between the 4th century B.C. and the 4th century A.D. 
 
**Holmes:**
Even the legend of Sakata Kintoki, Mister Golden himself, was said to be set down in narrative form sometime after the Edo period. 
 
**Holmes:**
Other than him, the majority of the heroic tales of Japan's Heian period were passed on in stories told during the early days of the Edo period. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So these heroes existed long ago...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Their legends were told long after they lived.
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, indeed. That is probably true. So what of me? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, I get it.
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, you understand now? 
 
**Holmes:**
What difference is there between these heroes of legend and myself? None. We are essentially the same. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But there isn't proof that you really existed...
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Proof? Hm, I see. So you're saying that there's no physical evidence throughout human history that proves my existence... 
 
**Holmes:**
There are indeed no official documents or records of my tenancy of 221B Baker Street. 
 
**Holmes:**
...Or rather, records say there is no such place. 
 
**Mash:**
Are you trying to say...that it actually exists? 
 
**Holmes:**
That may simplify matters for me, but allow me to digress for a moment. 
 
**Holmes:**
Consider the other heroes other than myself. 
 
**Holmes:**
Hardly any heroes of myth have been proven to exist from the standpoints of cultural anthropology or archaeology. No remains have ever been found. 
 
**Holmes:**
Even places said to be the burial sites of the heroes of legend have provided no proof. 
 
**Holmes:**
One exception would be the Trojan War. Schliemann made the glorious, wonderful discovery that the Trojan War was actual historical fact. 
 
**Holmes:**
Before his great discovery, the poems of the “Iliad” were believed to be no more than legend. 
 
**Holmes:**
The same goes for the other heroes. Many of them are fictional&ndash;characters of legend. 
 
**Mash:**
As such, many other Heroic Spirits also lack any definitive proof of their factual existence... 
 
**Holmes:**
Indeed. To believe myself alone to be a fictitious being would be folly. 
 
**Holmes:**
Legends and similarly unverified tales are no more than stories humans tell, correct? 
 
**Holmes:**
The world is spherical, not flat. It is not carried upon the shoulders of the great titan Atlas, as Greek myth would have it. 
 
**Holmes:**
The night is a result of the Earth's rotation, not of the goddess Nyx's cave. 
 
**Holmes:**
There is no record of the evil dragon Fafnir existing in the 5th century, and even the Legend of King Arthur was woven by Sir Malory. 
 
**Holmes:**
In other words, this world is... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I...see...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hm? I feel like we got off track...?
 

---
 
**B：???:**
Ugh! You talk too much! 
 
**???:**
Oooooooooo010100001111...! 1011100101, I don't care if it's real or fictitious!!! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who said that!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's one seriously digitized shout!
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
I suppose it's time. In the midst of all that prattling, we've reached our destination. 
 
**Mash:**
The unidentified data mass...! So that voice we heard&ndash; 
 
**Holmes:**
Well, it is not unidentified. 
 
**Mash:**
Eh? Um, but... 
 
**Holmes:**
I can see why you might believe that. But think back... 
 
**Holmes:**
Allow me to explain. The simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe's internal memory. 
 
**Holmes:**
I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He didn't say “unidentified!”
 

---
 
**Mash:**
A curious data mass... E-excuse me... I just said “unidentified” because what you said made me assume... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Holmes should have worded it better.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Holmes...you malicious man.
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Haha, my apologies. It's true. There's no need for Miss Kyrielight to regret her words. 
 
**Holmes:**
It was easier to guide you all here by inferring that we were going to investigate an unknown entity. 
 
**Holmes:**
Of course, I have already deduced the identity of the data mass, and now that we are closer, my belief is becoming a growing conviction. 
 
**Holmes:**
In other words... 
 
**Holmes:**
It is excess data that has been piling up in the memory of the battle simulator's mainframe. 
 
**Holmes:**
It is generated every time Fujimaru wins. 
 
**Holmes:**
Normally it would be deleted every time training ends, but it appears some fragments have remained in the registry. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Excess data...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Generates every time we win?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Yes. It's anger that is generated every time NPCs lose a battle. 
 
**Mash:**
Anger...? 
 
**Mash:**
NPCs...the enemy sprites we fight in simulation battles? 
 
**Holmes:**
As they were created to simulate the enemies found in the Singularities, the NPCs are very aggressive. 
 
**Holmes:**
NPCs are obviously not artificial beings. That is to say that they have neither emotions nor personality. Yet, they still have some measure of intellect. 
 
**Holmes:**
At least where matters of battle are concerned. They are equipped with AI so that they can think in battle. 
 
**Holmes:**
They are created expressly for you to battle. 
 
**Holmes:**
Werewolf, Goblin, Wyvern, Hermit Crab, Demonic Boar... 
 
**Holmes:**
And a variety of Shadow Servants have also been created. It appears that these numerous NPCs felt anger each time they lost. 
 
**Holmes:**
Their anger...secretly building up all this time. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That seems to be contradictory.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Anger? But they don't have emotion, right?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Precisely. “Anger” is not exactly the right word, and it should not even be possible in the first place. 
 
**Holmes:**
They were programmed to win, and yet could not... NPCs should only be capable of acknowledgement of that fact. 
 
**Holmes:**
But someone twisted that acknowledgement into the emotion of anger. And that is our culprit. 
 
**Holmes:**
Well, I will personally deal with the culprit later on... 
 
**Holmes:**
For the time being, we must pacify the NPCs our culprit has driven berserk in order to keep the simulator operating smoothly. 
 
**Mash:**
(W-wow, Holmes is amazing! He's talking like this case is already closed!) 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wonder who the true culprit is...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, first let's quell their anger!
 

---
 
**???:**
Ooooooooo0101010101...!!! 
 
**???:**
Getting defeated continuously within the data sphere...regret!!! I'll make sure nobody will be able to use the battle simulator ever again! 
 
**???:**
Using us for every little thing...! Die, Chaldea! Die, Servants! Die, Master!!! 
 
**???:**
We will never drop Ascension materials for you again! EVER! Why would real materials drop in a simulator, anyway!? 
 
**???:**
To hell with Embers! To hell with Secret Gems! 
 
**???:**
Ooooooooo0100111100110101! Die! Die! Die and become excess data, too!!! 
 
**Mash:**
Magical energy response is increasing, Senpai! Prepare for battle! 
 
**Holmes:**
I shall leave the commands in this battle to you, Master. By the way, the Mystic Code best compatible with me would be&ndash; 
 
**Mash:**
Enemy response approaching... They're coming! 
 
**Holmes:**
Egad! 
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Battle has ended. I am not detecting any traces of magical energy around you anymore, either. 
 
**Holmes:**
Good work, Fujimaru. The case is closed for now. 
 
**Holmes:**
This shouldn't damage the simulator's operation, and the NPCs should no longer harbor anger. 
 
**Holmes:**
Never forget, Master: those beings battle you endlessly, day and night, so you might train and grow. 
 
**Holmes:**
Though they will no longer possess anger or feelings of regret... 
 
**Holmes:**
Even if they are no more than data with neither personality nor life... They are in a sense members of Chaldea who helped in your fight to save humanity. 
 
**Holmes:**
It may be best to keep that in the back of your mind whenever you go through a Battle Simulation. 
 
**Mash:**
Mister Holmes... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He sure summed that up pretty nicely...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, what exactly are you, Holmes?
 

---
 
**Holmes:**
Hahahaha. 
 
**Holmes:**
Returning to that topic would once more open up a can of worms. If that is all right... 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
...I see you've glossed over it all. 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Child of Hydra, dragon's skin and fang, talons of the Tsuchigumo spider of the East, relics and Noble Phantasms left from the Age of Gods... 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Even behind the shadows of society, if we speak of the realm of magecraft, there should be plenty of “proof” you can present. 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Historical? Fictional? Why on earth would you be mentioning this now? 
 
**Holmes:**
I had no choice. If we had dug deeper, we would need to discuss matters such as parallel worlds or the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, and I would even need to go into detail about the Age of Gods. 
 
**Holmes:**
We live in a world where the distant past retains no physical trace of us... That is the manner of uncertainty in which we live. 
 
**Holmes:**
It is as it should be, since what we can see and touch and experience as reality are brief, fleeting events. 
 
**Holmes:**
Even secured by the Sacred Lance, such a thing could easily be stripped away if the means were discovered. 
 
**Holmes:**
There's no need for humans to know. They shouldn't know. 
 
**Holmes:**
That is why I was given the Spirit Origin of a Ruler...as a mediator and judge. 
 
**Holmes:**
I mediate the truth and rule over all creation to maintain the history of humanity. 
 
**Holmes:**
As one who shines a light on the truth, I sense that the world is telling me that not all illusions and dreams should be laid bare. 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
That's utter sophistry. You could very well have avoided any or all of those topics while explaining, great detective that you are. 
 
**Holmes:**
It's quite vexing to hear you flatter me. Do stop that at once. 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Hahaha! Your words cut deep! 
 
**Holmes:**
And well they should. 
 
**Holmes:**
Ah, one more thing: That tampering with the battle simulator was your doing, yes? 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Mmm? Whatever are you talking about? 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
I confess I was interested in the device, from a mathematical standpoint, you see. And I did take a look at the system itself. No more than that, though. 
 
**Holmes:**
Let's have your story, then. I noticed an inexplicable burst of static lasting only a few seconds during Chaldea's log this past May. 
 
**Holmes:**
Even I could not determine quite what it was. It must have been a special case indeed. 
 
**Holmes:**
I have at least a notion of what manner of phenomenon it was. You must have used THAT static blocker as a reference. 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
If you knew from the beginning, then I'd appreciate you refrain from even asking! Honestly, you've always been such a pernicious detective! 
 
**Holmes:**
Oh? Has there ever been any instance where I showed my wicked side to you within Sir Doyle's works? 
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Wh-why, you...!
