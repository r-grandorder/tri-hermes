# Trial Quest - Scatatch

## Master of the Ghost Cave
 
**Mash:**
...Sen...pai? 
 
**Mash:**
This... Looks like Fuyuki city... But I don't remember Rayshifting... 
 
**Mash:**
I'm having trouble remembering much of anything. I took some medicine and laid down... 
 
**Mash:**
But now I'm in this form... I'm armed as a Demi-Servant. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fofooou! 
 
**Mash:**
Fou!? When did you get into the carrying space in my shield? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyaau? 
 
**Mash:**
...I can't contact Chaldea's control room. So the doctor can't analyze our situation or bring us back. 
 
**Mash:**
One possibility is... That this is a type of shared memory between the Servant and the Master... A type of dream. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Those flames are awfully hot for a dream.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. I can feel the heat as if it's real. 
 
**Mash:**
This is the same Fuyuki city we traveled to with the director. But whether it's the same era, or if we're dreaming... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's so much fire but I don't feel the heat.
 
**Mash:**
...? You don't feel the heat? Maybe it's because I'm a Demi-Servant... 
 
**Mash:**
I may be different than you. ...That makes me a little sad. 
 

---
 
**???:**
&mdash;I see. So this is how you "perceive" this place. 
 
**???:**
I know your names already. Fujimaru, and the girl is Mash Kyrielight. 
 
**???:**
You are inside a dream, sharing a memory of an intense experience you both had. 
 
**???:**
Perhaps I should say this is how the "system" works. Still, this is quite an interesting phenomenon. 
 
**Mash:**
...Who are you? 
 
**Mash:**
Your magical energy... It does feel like a Servant's, but... 
 
**Mash:**
...Something seems very different somehow... 
 
**Mash:**
You're not one of the Servants we saw in Fuyuki... Not only that, but I don't think 
 
**Mash:**
we've ever met you before. I don't...think so, anyway. My memory's hazy... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't remember you.
 
**???:**
Hmm. Of course not. 
 
**???:**
It's been 2,000 years since I've shown myself to anyone. We couldn't have met. 
 
**???:**
...If you said you had seen me, then we'd have a bit of a problem. 
 
**???:**
You're not an escapee from my realm, are you? You're not a ghost either, correct? 
 
**Mash:**
...We're not ghost-type monsters, no. But, you said 2,000 years, right? 
 
**Mash:**
That would be around the birth of Christ... Do you mean that's when you were alive? 
 
**???:**
...Hmm. So drawing a clear line to explain my existence, huh? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 I've seen that spear...
 
**???:**
Hmm, I feel a passionate gaze upon me. 
 
**???:**
Oh, it's not me, but my spear you're looking at? It's good that you can assess weapons at your age. 
 
**???:**
But this isn't what you are expecting. It's not a Divine Construct, forged by The Sea God, Manannan. 
 
**???:**
Sadly, it's just a spear. A stick, made from the skeleton of a sea creature. 
 
**???:**
...Or perhaps you were pretending to look at the spear, but were actually looking at me? 
 
**???:**
Heheh. You've never met an Ulster woman, have you? 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I know how you feel, but please restrain yourself for now. 
 
**Mash:**
It's true that her proportions are... just about perfect, but... 
 
**Fou:**
Foou! 
 

---
 
**???:**
Hmm. How should I put this? Thinking back, I haven't given many people my name. 
 
**???:**
The warriors knew my name when they visited my home. The beasts and fallen gods challenged me out of fear. 
 
**???:**
They all feared me because they knew who I was. 
 
**???:**
It's been a long time since you&mdash;no, people like you have asked me what my name is without prejudice. 
 
**???:**
And so I have no choice but to answer honestly. 
 
**???:**
I am a being which exists outside the world. 
 
**???:**
Something which was to exist forever, without getting old or dying. 
 
**???:**
My name is Scáthach, the ruler of Dún Scáith, the Land of Shadows. Although it does make me a little uncomfortable announcing it like that. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Fou:**
Kya&mdash;u!? 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach! The god-killing superhuman who's said to practically be a divinity herself? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is she amazing?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see. Scáthach, huh...
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai! She's mentioned in the Celtic myths of the first century, particularly the Ulster Cycle! 
 
**Mash:**
An invincible warrior, the ruler of a supernatural realm similar to the underworld. She even trained the great hero Cú Chulainn! 
 
**Mash:**
And she's also a "great magus," one of the best ever... But she shouldn't "exist in the Throne of Heroes," so why!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doesn't exist in the Throne of Heroes?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean she can't be a Servant?
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, so the girl knew? You're correct, points for you. Hmm... 
 
**Scáthach:**
You did talk a little too fast, three stars! 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Oh, right. Thank you very much. 
 
**Scáthach:**
It's all right. In your case, it's more effective to speak quietly. Keep it all within you, and be like a silent burning flame. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Sorry, that's an old habit of mine. We don't have time for long chats. 
 
**Scáthach:**
As Mash said, I was never meant to be here. Since I retired from the battlefields. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I won't get into too much of why I've been summoned, but&ndash; 
 
**Scáthach:**
I've shown myself for a good reason. To solve the problem occurring within this dream. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Master of Chaldea and you, new Servant, calm yourselves and open your eyes. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Witness what was brought forth by all the abnormality. Something is out of the ordinary here. 
 
**???:**
AAAAAA... 
 
**???:**
AAAAAAAA! 
 
**Mash:**
I saw them as soon as I sensed their magical energy! Enemy approaching, Senpai! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If they're attacking we have to fight them.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stay calm and be careful.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Right! Beginning combat! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Now this is worth traveling through the eras. An impressive response, and pleasantly high morale. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm... I had decided myself to an easy retirement, but seeing you has made me change my mind. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Here we go... 
 
**Mash:**
Wah!? Scáthach!? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, I'll be playing too, Mash. Fujimaru! Save me a seat! 
 
**Scáthach:**
It's time for battle! First, fight. Fight before you think. Worrying comes after, as a privilege of the living. 
 
**Scáthach:**
So fight, fight, fight, and win! That's the Celtic way! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Celts are crazy...
 
**Mash:**
R-Right... It's like violence is a necessity for them... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai!? 
 

---
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Now that was an easy fight, I couldn't even remember what they looked like. I guess they weren't that tough, huh? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Now, tell me, Fujimaru. What did those enemies look like to you? 
 
**Mash:**
We've fought them several times before... Did they look different to you, Scáthach? 
 
**Scáthach:**
They looked like a smoky haze. To me, they seemed to barely exist. 
 
**Scáthach:**
And that's because, not once have I perceived the idea of death. 
 
**Fou:**
Fo-fou, fou? 
 
**Mash:**
Death? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Indeed. What you're seeing isn't memories of your past... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Nor some kind of symbolism from your dreams. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Those are remnants left behind of a miserable death. They should not exist within you at all. 
 
**Scáthach:**
To be more precise, they are the "remnants left behind even by death." 
 
**Scáthach:**
These flames you see. The ones you fought. 
 
**Scáthach:**
They are the remnants left behind by the death you witnessed as you fought to protect humanity. 
 
**Scáthach:**
There were many others around. Ten thousand or so moving corpses and skeletons. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But I took care of all of them. They weren't worth teaching anything. They were far too weak. 
 
**Mash:**
T-Ten thousand? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hahaha, I'm pleased that you're surprised, but you could've just laughed it off, Mash. 
 
**Scáthach:**
To a Celtic warrior, numbers mean nothing. 
 
**Scáthach:**
We're all idiots who fight until we're dead, or there's no one left to fight! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...You mean death is attacking us?
 
**Scáthach:**
No, no, that's not it. That's not it at all. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't understand.
 
**Scáthach:**
That's fine. That's how you should be. You probably haven't grasp the concept of death yet. 
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
"This place" is overflowing with remnants "abandoned" by death. 
 
**Mash:**
This is a dream I'm sharing with Senpai, right? So why would it be filled with something like that? 
 
**Mash:**
I don't think the Heroic Spirit I got my power from had the attribute to interfere with death... 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'm sure. A Heroic Spirit who brings death wouldn't suit you at all. This phenomenon is taking place inside you... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...But the causal factor is outside. It's a touch unfair, but, it can't be helped. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's what it means for all of human history to be incinerated. 
 
**Scáthach:**
A normal extinction would cause death to overflow. Purgatory, underworld, anywhere souls can go would be overflowing. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But this is different. Incineration of Humanity is a "great deed" that doesn't just burn away life, but death itself. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou... Fooooouuu... 
 
**Mash:**
A great deed...that burns away death? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes. Miracles that humans use are things like magecraft, rituals, sacraments, and curses. 
 
**Scáthach:**
And then there are the "Authorities" the gods are said to possess. But the Incineration of Humanity doesn't belong to any of those. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Thus, it is a great deed. A human "feat" which surpasses even the "gods." 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Though not even I am certain what that truly is. 
 
**Scáthach:**
And so what you're seeing here are the remnants abandoned by death, the direct result after many eras being incinerated. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Then, some of them leaked into this place. 
 
**Mash:**
You don't... You don't mean inside Chaldea? 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's correct, in a sense, but also not. Those remnants exist even closer than you imagined. 
 
**Mash:**
What do you mean? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Here. Put your hands up here. 
 
**Mash:**
...My chest? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Indeed. But not those marshmallows. It's the warm "heart" that's pulsing inside of you with life. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Mash:**
D-Do you mean... Those remnants have already been corrupting us!? 
 
**Mash:**
That's... What you mean, right? That's why I'm suddenly with Senpai in these flames... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. I don't think you have to worry.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It'll be fine. Let's go back to Chaldea together.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Senpai. You're right. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hehe. I thought you'd get scared, but you're holding on to hope. I can't believe how pure you are, but those purest are often the strongest. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Fujimaru's optimism and Mash's pessimism. I find both equally worthy. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Even after two thousand years, you humans haven't changed a bit. So fragile and ephemeral, but noble and beautiful. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&mdash;It's time to go. Follow me. 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right. ...No, wait. Where are we going? 
 
**Scáthach:**
To destroy all the remnants that threatens to overwhelm you. 
 
**Scáthach:**
As my Land of Shadows no longer exists, normally I wouldn't waste time on ghosts abandoned even by the wheel of reincarnation. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But I do not think I can just let these things overflow. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...I know how frustrating it is to want to die, and not be able to. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If the gods will not save them, I will. If they want a fight, I have no reason to refuse. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So this is the Celtic way!
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, Senpai... This violent but dependable power is the Celtic way... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Is the Celtic way getting to you? 
 

---
 
## Spiral Rainbow
 
**Scáthach:**
...That sure is an awful lot of fire, huh? 
 
**Scáthach:**
I already know your names, Fujimaru, Mash. However... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...That doesn't mean I know everything about you. Nor the reason this city is on flames. 
 
**Scáthach:**
What happened here? This is a place where you once walked, yes? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Fuyuki City, in the far east. That first place we shifted to where a Holy Grail War was taking place. 
 
**Mash:**
The year was AD 2004. 13 years ago. It's very close to the present, but it's still part of the past. 
 
**Mash:**
This is where we... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got caught up in a Holy Grail War that shouldn't exist.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. We fought many Heroic Spirit for the fragment of the Grail. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Got saved by that Caster guy.
 
**Mash:**
...That's right, Senpai. Without him, we would've died. 
 

---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyau! 
 
**Mash:**
That's right, Fou. He's the one who taught me how to pseudo-deploy the Noble Phantasm that was too much for me. 
 
**Mash:**
Caster Cú Chulainn. I couldn't possibly thank him enough. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Oh? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh. I see, I see. "That's why" it's me, huh? You knew him. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Mash, Fujimaru. I'm sorry, can I ask a question? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Was he doing well "at this place?" 
 
**Mash:**
Oh... Yes! He was doing very well. That's right! You're... 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach, a warrior, a mentor to many heroes. You're the woman who trained Cú Chulainn! 
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry. I knew that in my head, but it's so hard for me to remember that the Caster who saved us... 
 
**Mash:**
...is the same Cú Chulainn who's part of the Ulster Cycle, and s-so... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, calm down!
 
**Mash:**
R-R-R-R-Right, Senpai! 
 
**Fou:**
Foufou. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 
**Mash:**
YEAH! ...Huh? 
 

---
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry. I should've realized sooner... He saved our lives. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't know what to say... Um... Y-Your student really helped us out. 
 
**Mash:**
We're alive today thanks to the spell he wielded when he materialized as a Druid. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I see. No, there's no need to thank me. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But nonetheless, as someone deeply related to him, I shall remember that. And someday, I will tell him. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If I ever get the chance, that is. For now, you must first survive this place. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Otherwise, I'll have to tell him that I saw the children he saved... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...as they died. Now, survive! You must be strong! 
 
**???:**
GAAAAAA! 
 
**Mash:**
That roar!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds pretty big.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A... Dragon?
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
That is another remnant of death you witnessed... Or perhaps, will witness in the future. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Time means very little in this place. Just like the Throne of Heroes. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Either way, it's something that's been left behind. Now, overcome this trial, young ones! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou! Kyau! 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right... You're right, Fou. I think that might be... 
 
**Mash:**
That might be a little too big! S-Senpai! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Scáthach!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can you do something about that?
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
...I guess it would be cruel to make you do everything on your own. Come forth from my "Gate," ye Spiral Rainbow. 
 
**Scáthach:**
With the divine lightning in your hand, come forth, come forth and fight! Oh Guardian of Ulster. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
My body feels numb.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My head feels numb.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai's magical circuits are being activated in a strange way! Scáthach, what are you doing? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm... So that's how young kids are inside these days... Mages' bodies certainly have changed... 
 
**Scáthach:**
This innocent response is truly&mdash; Oh, no. Never mind. It's a temporary contract. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'll lend you a new power. Come forth, come forth and fight, Spiral Rainbow Sword! 
 
**Fergus:**
Hahahaha! Finally it's time, huh? I'm so glad it happened before I got bored and went to sleep! 
 
**Fergus:**
The young leader of the Ulster Red Branch Knights! Fergus mac Róich, at your service! 
 
**Fergus:**
I've been waiting for this for a while now, Ms. Scáthach! Hahahahahaha! Damn, it sure is hot in here! 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Stop calling me that. When you say it, it makes me feel like a real elder. 
 
**Fergus:**
Oh, yes. Right, right. Sorry. You're always young, Lady Scáthach. 
 
**Fergus:**
Your heart is young, as are your skills! As sharp as when you were in your teens! But that's a different matter! 
 
**Fergus:**
I can't call the mentor I respect a little girl! That's not the Red Branch way! Sorry, Ms. Scáthach! 
 
**Mash:**
A very boisterous looking man has appeared! Senpai, the Celtic-ness of this place is going up quickly! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're... Uncle Fergus!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 

---
 
**Fergus:**
Indeed! Heh, we've got some spirited new kids, huh? 
 
**Fergus:**
I guess you're Ms. Scáthach's latest students. Let's see. A pretty looking girl and a [♂ boy /♀ girl]... She put her hands on you yet? 
 
**Scáthach:**
I don't go after everything that moves, like you. I invite only the finest warriors to my bedchamber. 
 
**Scáthach:**
They are the source of this dream. And hopefully, the ones who can someday lead us. 
 
**Fergus:**
I see! Oh dear, I'm sorry. Hahaha! Then let's start with a drink! Have a drink with me! 
 
**Fergus:**
Or let's do something else! If you need a drinking buddy though, I'm your guy! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, uh. Huh! N-no, I'm sorry, I&mdash; 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Senpai too? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So that's it, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**

 

---
 
**???:**
GAAAA! 
 
**Fergus:**
Hey, it was hot a moment ago, but now it's even hotter! Also I see something big, and worth punching! Even better! 
 
**Fergus:**
So that's what I'm here for, eh? You need the greatest swordsman the Ulster has! 
 
**Fergus:**
Time for me to show off my blade! Ms. Scáthach, let me handle this! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sword... What sword?
 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha! What, you don't know my Noble Phantasm? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That drill can't be... It can't be...
 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha! So you know my Noble Phantasm, huh? 
 

---
 
**Fergus:**
Then behold my Rainbow Sword! Caladbolg, the sword that's both rainbows and lightning! 
 
**Fergus:**
If Cú Chulainn of the Red Branch Knights stabs his foes, then I, Fergus, tear them to shreds! 
 
**Mash:**
The mystic sword Caladbolg! A legendary sword, said to be the model of many other mystic and holy swords! 
 
**Fergus:**
Heaven and Earth, spin, spin, spin! Watch in awe as I wield my immense strength! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fergus:**
Hmm... It looked like a famous dragon, but it didn't feel that strong. 
 
**Fergus:**
Next time, I hope to fight one with the proper mind, body and skill! 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's right, but do not let your guard down. Always face an enemy, even a weak one, with your full strength. 
 
**Fergus:**
Hmm... Of course, I did not hold back. But are you telling me to fight until my flesh tears and bone breaks? 
 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha! As expected of Ms. Scáthach! Just how strict can you get? 
 
**Mash:**
One of the heroes depicted in the Ulster Cycle, a great warrior of the Red Branch Knights, Fergus mac Róich... 
 
**Mash:**
Um, Fergus. You're another one of Cú Chulainn's teachers, right? 
 
**Fou:**
Foufou. 
 
**Fergus:**
Hmm? You mean Sétanta? I did teach him to use a sword, but... 
 
**Fergus:**
Unfortunately, he wasn't much of a swordsman. He quickly switched to the spear. 
 
**Fergus:**
I trained with him and also looked after him. You can say he's almost like my own child. 
 
**Fergus:**
So, do you know him? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Right, it seems they fought together. In this ruined city ravaged by flames called Fuyuki. 
 
**Fergus:**
Sounds like the Norse Ragnarok. That must be so much fun. I'm jealous. 
 
**Fergus:**
One of his natural talents is having the luck to be blessed with the most terrifying battles. 
 
**Fergus:**
If I was there, I could've challenged him to see who was the better warrior. What a shame. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He was a druid.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He was an amazing mage.
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh right, now I remember. They say he was dressed as a druid. 
 
**Fergus:**
...WHAT!? Was he being bullied? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hahaha! Yes, that's the reaction I was looking for. Nothing really gets funnier than this. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufoou, kyuu? 
 
**Mash:**
Um, thank you, Fergus. You helped us even though we summoned you without warning... 
 
**Fergus:**
Don't worry about it. This was just a temporary contract. Plus, I couldn't refuse Ms. Scáthach's summon. 
 
**Fergus:**
By the way, what kind of sorcery did you use, Ms. Scáthach? How was I summoned during my mealtime? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It is strange, yeah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think a Holy Grail or its fragment is here, right?
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
You're right, a Holy Grail is not present. I tampered around with my Primordial Runes. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I used myself as a catalyst, and stocked Heroic Spirits that I have relations to in this place. 
 
**Mash:**
Primordial... Runes? 
 
**Fou:**
Foou! Kyaau! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes. A true "Primordial Rune." A type of Magical Crest lost in your modern era. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Modern mages have no way of knowing this, but the runes carved by the Great God of the Norse still exist in this world. 
 
**Scáthach:**
The old runes made after that, and their modern recreations are not even close in comparison. 
 
**Fergus:**
I see, but I don't get it at all. Ms. Scáthach sure knows a lot! I wish one of us in Red Branch has even a fraction of that intellect. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ancient magecraft can do that?
 
**Mash:**
It's more than ancient, you can say it's from the Age of Gods. 
 
**Mash:**
That's amazing... Actually, it's really, really, amazing! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess that's Scáthach for you.
 
**Mash:**
Yeah... She's using a rune from the Age of Gods, made by an actual god! 
 
**Mash:**
It's unimaginable to us. If the Doctor was here he'd be going crazy. 
 

---
 
**Mash:**
But this explains something I'd been wondering about, Scáthach. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm. And what's that? 
 
**Mash:**
I finally understand why Cú Chulainn was using runes. He learned how to use them from you. 
 
**Mash:**
A Primordial Rune. An ultimate spell brought forth by the Great God of the Norse. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, I know that look on your face, Mash Kyrielight. You were wondering why he didn't use Ulster spells, right? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Ogham letters don't work well. Runes take effect as soon as they're drawn, which makes them better for a warrior. That's all. 
 
**Mash:**
I-I see... I understand that the letters of the Celtic God Ogham... 
 
**Mash:**
...are hard to use unless you're a true druid. Your power isn't affected by its origin, is it? 
 
**Scáthach:**
It's a matter of effectiveness. The Great God of the Norse is very kind to warriors. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Now, on to the next location. Are you ready to face the next remnant? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am ready anytime.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. I don't know how this happened, but I think I have an idea what we should do. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, that was a very powerful response. 
 
**Mash:**
Are you trying to be a Celt? Are you? 
 

---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufoou! Kyaau! 
 
## Coming from Ashes
 
**Fergus:**
Sigh... Talk about a disappointment. 
 
**Fergus:**
If this isn't a letdown, then what is? Yes, this is the prime place for a battle, yet still! 
 
**Fergus:**
I'd also love to go find a nice lady, but with things in this state there aren't any around! No men, either. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hah, lust is what makes a hero but you, you are on a completely different level. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Those bestial urges of yours might be the source of the power that makes you a hero. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Mash, did you know? This guy... 
 
**Mash:**
H-Huh? What? Why are you involving me in this conversation, Scáthach? 
 
**Scáthach:**
His lust is so strong that no human woman can be his wife. 
 
**Scáthach:**
They all gave up after a few days, and in the end he married a forest goddess. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's right, a Divine Spirit. Gods' appearances were rare to begin with in the Ulster Cycle... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...and one of those very rare appearances was made by his wife. He was too much to handle a goddess had to show up. 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yeah... Um... 
 
**Mash:**
I don't...know...what to say... Um... S-Senpai... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's amazing, Fergus.
 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha! You've got that right, if I do say so myself! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know what to do either!
 
**Fou:**
Foufou. Fou. 
 

---
 
**Fergus:**
Whew...  At this point I'll just have to risk my life and ask Ms. Scáthach. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Fergus:**
To tell you the truth, Mash, Fujimaru, I thought about asking you two... 
 
**Fergus:**
...but you're being guided by the Ms. Scáthach right now. You're basically kids, in a sense. 
 
**Fergus:**
I can't be going after kids. Which means, well, I've got just one option. No, it's not one I was avoiding. 
 
**Fergus:**
As an Ulster man, it's my destiny to someday make the Lady of Shadows my own... 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'm ready whenever. 
 
**Fergus:**
Oooh! How lucky am I!? 
 
**Fou:**
Foufoufou! 
 
**Scáthach:**
If you want to receive a blow from my spear that can kill a god, then feel free. Come closer. Don't worry, I will treat you well. 
 
**Fergus:**
Oh... Um... So... Well... 
 
**Fergus:**
I-I guess there's no hurry on that one. First, we've gotta get these kids to safety! 
 
**Fergus:**
And when that's done! I'll take you up on your offer! 
 
**Fergus:**
First, we fight! If I win, of course, you keep your promise. But if I lose, we'll talk then! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're so bold, Fergus!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 

---
 
**Mash:**
R-Right, Senpai. I think he's 100% serious. I don't know whether to be amazed or frightened... 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hehe. Dauntlessness, desire, vigor and lack of avarice. A hero must have all these things. 
 
**Scáthach:**
They are what makes a hero an object of admiration. They are a symbol of glory and victory. 
 
**Mash:**
That's what makes a hero? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Mash Kyrielight, don't look so confused. There's no need to force yourselves to mimic him. 
 
**Scáthach:**
It is a virtue to reflect on oneself in the presence of the strong. There, there. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh... You're patting my head... R-Right... 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes. Now it's your turn, Fujimaru. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Get your head patted.)
 
**Scáthach:**
...Yes, good child. There, there. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Dodge her head pats.)
 
**Scáthach:**
...What? Why are you so embarrassed? 
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
Men can only become what they become. You cannot be anyone but yourself. Ever. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Now, that's enough talking. 
 
**???:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! 
 
**Mash:**
T-This is an incredible amount of magical energy! It's absorbing all the mana in the surrounding area automatically? 
 
**Mash:**
It's clearly viewing us as enemies! It's looking at us... 
 
**???:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! 
 
**Mash:**
This... This can't be... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calm down, Mash.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's not that different from the others.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
...Right, Senpai. I was panicking for a second. Now I'm okay. I can fight! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, I see. So that's your response? Do you fear it so much, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. It scares me a lot. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure I'm scared of any fighting... But I'll fight anyway. Because I need to. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Humph. Even if someday, the fight may take your life? 
 
**Mash:**
Of course. My fear and my life are two different things. 
 
**Mash:**
And... I know something even scarier. 
 
**Mash:**
I already know how sad it is to do nothing, &mdash;the desolation of leaving nothing behind. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...I see. So you've already reached the deepest truth of life. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Then I've nothing more to say. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If you die here, you'll be ripped apart from the inside, and Chaldea will be filled with the remnants of death. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Humanity, civilization, everything you've done, everything that exists will lose their last hope forever. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I figured that was the case.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. I feel the same way! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, faau! Kyau! 
 
**Fergus:**
Excellent! Glad to see you're ready to fight! Let's tear this thing apart then! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We defeated it! Good work, Senpai. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou! Kyau, kyauu! 
 
**Fergus:**
It wasn't a dragon, or a boar, or a giant snake... Humph. I've never seen a monster pillar like that. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm... 
 
**Scáthach:**
It was beautiful in its own otherworldly way. It would serve as a support pillar for my castle in the Land of Shadows. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But it's not something that should be praised too much. Besides, that's a really twisted way of naming something. 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach, perhaps you already knew what that thing really was? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Once you become part of the shadow and abyss you can see the future to a certain degree, But no, I didn't know about it beforehand... 
 
**Scáthach:**
I simply saw a fragment of the future related to it. The Incineration of Humanity. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'm not that different than you. Though... 
 
**Scáthach:**
I can see things like...this! 
 
**Scáthach:**
...You dodged it, huh? I see why they call you the Great King of Destruction. 
 
**Altera:**
...That was what I was going to say. What is that spear made of that my blade cannot destroy? 
 
**Altera:**
I am a destroyer. Of both old and new civilization. 
 
**Altera:**
I will remove all traces of sentient beings from this planet. I will destroy all that stand in my way. 
 
**Mash:**
...You're!? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Kyuu, kyaau! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Is this another remnant of death? 
 
**Scáthach:**
This is quite the creature we've run into. Is the incineration of humanity capable of twisting things this far? 
 
**Mash:**
You know who she is, don't you? This Heroic spirit, whose magical energy rivals a dragon... 
 
**Scáthach:**
More than you do. As the slayer of many gods, and bearer of the knowledge of the Land of Shadows... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...and as a being who's achieved eternity on the outside of the world, I know one thing... 
 
**Scáthach:**
This would-be war machine is a little too dangerous to appear as a remnant of death! 
 
**Fergus:**
That's right. Indeed, Ms. Scáthach is just right! But, I do like slender bodies, though... 
 
**Fergus:**
I can feel the core of my groin tighten when I look at her! She might be even a better woman than Ms. Scáthach! 
 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha, but my intuition says what's inside her ain't quite what it looks like! 
 
**Fergus:**
Go on ahead, Fujimaru, Mash! 
 
**Fergus:**
My Caladbolg is enough to delay the incarnated form of the King of Destruction! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fergus!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 

---
 
**Fergus:**
Don't worry. It's a question of compatibility. 
 
**Fergus:**
My guess is that if I break her first, she won't be able to use her full power! 
 
**Fergus:**
Ms. Scáthach has the job of guiding you! So go! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Sorry, Fergus. I'll leave the rest to you. 
 
**Fergus:**
It's an honor! Until we meet again, friends! Now that fate's brought us together, I'm sure we will! 
 
**Mash:**
...Right! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foouuu! 
 
**Fergus:**
Good, they're gone. ...Well, next time we meet, they might be enemies. 
 
**Fergus:**
I'm always on the side with the best girls, so I can't guarantee anything there. 
 
**Altera:**
... 
 
**Fergus:**
Now, let's do this. Let's fight fair, square, and hard, so we've got no regrets. 
 
**Fergus:**
For as stubborn as you are, though, you're awfully polite. I can't believe you let Fujimaru go. 
 
**Altera:**
It's all the same. After I crush you, I'll destroy them too. 
 
**Altera:**
I destroy all that I see. That's what I was made for. 
 
**Fergus:**
You know, it'll be a hassle to break your body in that state. 
 
**Fergus:**
But you know! I'm ready for it! 
 
**Fergus:**
Whether it's coincidence, or inevitability I have no idea. It's probably a curse of the ancient gods... 
 
**Fergus:**
But the true identity of my spiral sword, being a fragment of the distant, ancient gods is more than enough reason to kill you! 
 
**Altera:**
...Target, one. Initiate destruction. 
 
## Final Guidance
 
**Mash:**
...Is Fergus okay, you think? 
 
**Mash:**
I can't detect his magical energy, maybe because of the fire. His temporary contract with Senpai appears to be broken. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foouu... Fouu... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uncle...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fergus...
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
Don't make that face, Fujimaru. Celtic warriors live to challenge the powerful. 
 
**Scáthach:**
And you're still alive. Whether he died or not, he achieved his goal. 
 
**Scáthach:**
The most you can do is laugh. He'd say he didn't need anything, but if you want to give him something, that's enough. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Did you not hear me? ...Hmm. Maybe you didn't. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Still, this town's flame sure is burning bright. Also, it seems we've been running around in circles. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are we back here?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I think I understand.
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
A town about to burn to the ground, huh? This place must have left strong impressions of death on you. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's why there are so many remnants here that were abandoned even by death. 
 
**???:**
Exactly what you just said... 
 
**???:**
This place will be overflowing with those remnants, and much sorrow and pain as well. 
 
**Scáthach:**
So you're here. The last Heroic Spirit I prepared. The first spear of the glorious knights from the Fenian Cycle. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou!? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
My true name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. I've been summoned as a Lancer for this temporary contract. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
I will fight with you for the last trial. Scáthach, shield maiden, and my temporary Master. 
 
**Mash:**
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne! A hero from the second age of Celtic myths, the Fenian Cycle. 
 
**Mash:**
He brought glory to the Knights of Fianna along with the god-slaying hero, Fionn mac Cumhaill. Then... 
 
**Diarmuid:**
... 
 
**Mash:**
Uh... 
 
**Mash:**
Sorry. I should have kept my mouth shut. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you say something bad?
 

---
 
**Diarmuid:**
No. Fret not, shield maiden. The incidents in the legend were a result of my own disloyalty and lack of virtue. 
 
**Scáthach:**
The hero's end was betrayal and death. A man of glory isn't guaranteed a happy ending. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That goes for more than just Diarmuid. The greater the admiration for a hero... 
 
**Scáthach:**
...the more likely they are to meet a tragic end. "I have no end," so it's not a concern for me. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Thinking back, yes... Not even Sétanta's end was a happy one. 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach... 
 
**Scáthach:**
No, this is where you laugh, Mash. Celtic men leave behind nothing but tears and rage for their women. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If you don't laugh, you'll end up hating them. Of course, that's not an absolute rule. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
It's true that I regret my end. That's why my lance can be of aid to you. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Even if this is a temporary contract, a Master is no different than a liege lord. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, Diarmuid.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's fight together.
 

---
 
**Diarmuid:**
...What a pleasant response... There are no lies in your heart, are there? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Then I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, shall become your spear with all my spirit! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, yes. I figured you'd get along. Diarmuid prefers Masters who are exactly what they seem to be. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I've raised so many warriors that I think I've got a good eye for when people will get along. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're like a goddess of relationships.
 
**Scáthach:**
Well, I'm nothing of the sort, but... I don't mind being told that. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Heh. That's an interesting idea, Fujimaru. Goddess of Relationships... I might think about that... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're like an old matchmaking aunt.
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai! N-N-No! That's so rude... 
 
**Mash:**
N-No, I don't mean there's anything wrong with being an old matchmaking lady, but... 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm, I see, I see. You want to die. You want to die here, huh Fujimaru? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Mash's phrasing isn't too bad, though. Lady. That sounds elegant. I like it. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Well, the fact is, in human years I'm over 2000 years old. It doesn't bother me that much, and I haven't had the chance anyway. 
 
**Mash:**
The chance? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hehehe. Don't worry about it. Perhaps I'll tell you someday, but not now. 
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
Now then. Enough fun. The last remnant approaches. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou! Kyuu! 
 
**???:**
 
**Mash:**
I sense a Heroic Spirit, or no... 
 
**Scáthach:**
The Heroic Spirit Orion. Or no, your true name is&mdash; one of the old gods of Mt. Olympus. Artemis, the moon goddess. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But what gave you that form? Oh, I see. The tales of you falling in love with a human are true. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That explains your human form, but... 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foouuu! Kyuu! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong, Fou?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
F-Fou is really excited!
 

---
 
**Scáthach:**
Perhaps that beast understands. Yes. This avatar of the moon goddess is another remnant abandoned by death. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Its ferocity and savagery... Oh, it rivals that cursed boar! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes, the ancient moon goddess had another side, a cruel one that would spread plagues, bring death, and drive men mad. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
The gods are not always a blessing to humanity. Sometimes, like this, they will bare their fangs just like mother nature. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
That's why we, the Knights of Fianna, were once needed in ancient Erin. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
To protect the people from demons. To protect them from the gods. 
 
**???:**
 
**Mash:**
The ferocity...of a god... I feel an incredible animosity and urge to kill! 
 
**Scáthach:**
I wonder if this remnant is from your past, or from your future. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Whichever it is, an avatar of a god is still a god! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hahahaha! It's been so long since I've killed a god! I'm excited! 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'll kill you, Artemis! It's disgusting that you would take a "human form." 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Scáthach, you're really excited!
 
**Scáthach:**
It's been so, so long since I've fought a Mediterranean god! I can't wait! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 
**Scáthach:**
A splendid answer from the heart, Fujimaru! 
 

---
 
**Mash:**
... ... 
 
**Mash:**
...We're going to fight a god. A Divine Spirit. No, but it's an avatar. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. Just calm down and do it like always.
 

---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, I'm fine. 
 
**Mash:**
Whether this is a dream, or reality, if I'm with you I can fight! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Here it comes! Are you guys ready? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Artemis:**
...Oh? 
 
**Artemis:**
Oh dear, oh dear... I feel like I've been very mean to you. 
 
**Artemis:**
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Even though Darling didn't tell me to, I... 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...It was only for one battle, but if I was of use to you, there is no greater joy. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Shield maiden, temporary Master. Someday, beyond the end of time, we may meet. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Farewell. Scáthach... A million thanks for your compassion. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this...the end?
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai... 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach said this was the last remnant. Which means we should be done? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Correct. You get a perfect score. Now, since that's done... 
 
**Scáthach:**
This is as far as I go. The overflowing remnants have been removed from your hearts. 
 
**Scáthach:**
So there's no need for me to force myself to stay in this realm. 
 
**Fou:**
Foou, fou... 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach... 
 
**Scáthach:**
Even if you die, you will never become remnants. So there's nothing to fear... Though I suppose it's cruel to say that. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Fear, tremble, and yet stand against a pride that would incinerate even death. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If nothing else, you've done it once. 
 
**Scáthach:**
So it should be just as easy to do it again, or three times, or a hundred. Do your jobs, and become the heroes who restored humanity. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can't do it a hundred times, Scáthach!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
YEAH!
 

---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. We'll do our best until the end. 
 
**Fou:**
Foou! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, yes. And with Fou's help, too!
