# Trial Quest / Strengthening - Mysterious Heroine X

Attention! This takes place during Saber Wars 2!

## "Interlude Entracte I"
 
**:**
A little while ago in a Servant Universe far, far away... 
 
**:**
　　　　　　　　　　～Planet Lothian～ 
 
**A：???:**
...Black Knight. 
 
**A：???:**
Black Knight... 
 
**A：???:**
Yeah. You. Servant AUX Voloid K6-X4. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Eh...are you talking to me?)


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...I can't speak.)


---
 
**A：???:**
Are you mad? 
 
**A：???:**
You sometimes space out. Even though you're a Voloid. You're really an odd one. 
 
**A：???:**
Did you, just, intercept some funny transmission? That's, no good. 
 
**A：???:**
There may be a time when I'll have to rely on you during battle. Maybe. 
 
**A：???:**
Yeah, but...I guess I don't really have room to talk about spacing out. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Voloid?)
 
**A：???:**
...Hm? Dumpling? 
 
**A：???:**
You want a dumpling? I just ate it. That dumpling. 
 
**A：???:**
But, you know&mdash; 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(What battle...?)
 
**A：???:**
... (Sigh) Red bean soup? 
 
**A：???:**
I'd like some, too. But&mdash; 
 

---
 
**A：???:**
What are you talking about? Your train of thought's gone off the rails. 
 
**A：???:**
Your conversational protocol's also been strange. Maybe I need to check for crossed wires. 
 
**A：???:**
It's unfortunate, but it looks like we're going to be apart from each other for a while. 
 
**A：???:**
Is it this...circuit here... Or this one...? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Stop, you're tickling me.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This nonsensical way of talking... Berserker?)

---
 
**A：???:**
... (Gasp) 
 
**B：???:**
Alter. X Alter. 
 
**X Alter:**
Yes, Master Agravain. Alter is here. 
 
**X Alter:**
Has the next land to purge been prophesied? 
 
**Agravain:**
... 
 
**Agravain:**
...We will need to go into hiding for a while. Their pursuit has grown more aggressive each day. 
 
**X Alter:**
I shall join you. No matter what kind of desolate star it may be. 
 
**Agravain:**
That is unnecessary. There is another job better suited to your skills. 
 
**Agravain:**
Alter. Guided by the Alternium, the prophesied child of destruction... 
 
**Agravain:**
A Berserker formed using the X Factor as a catalyst... 
 
**Agravain:**
A crystal of Alternium is hidden within your body, and you are granted the Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon. 
 
**Agravain:**
In this region of space, few know of you. That fact will aid us as we prepare to strike back. 
 
**Agravain:**
Our fellow lords have all fallen and been sealed away. The only one left is me&mdash; 
 
**X Alter:**
I am still here, Master. I, Alter, your own disciple. 
 
**X Alter:**
I shall not let the sacrifice of our great lord of Villains be in vain. 
 
**X Alter:**
My Mana Conversion Altereactor Engine is burning furiously, ready to defeat our sworn enemy, Heroine X. 
 
**Agravain:**
...Alter. What I am about to tell you is of the utmost importance. Carve it deep into your heart. Also, write it down on a piece of paper so you do not forget. 
 
**Agravain:**
You are going to go in hiding, and go on a journey alone. 
 
**Agravain:**
You are the final hope of Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. Or something like that. 
 
**Agravain:**
We must focus on the opportunity to realize our wish, while we work, obscure, from the shadows. 
 
**Agravain:**
We must sink into the muck, and become a slumbering dragon. For such a task, I would only be in your way. 
 
**X Alter:**
That... No... 
 
**X Alter:**
What are you talking about? That doesn't make sense. It's incomprehensible, like a wet piece of toast smothered in jam. 
 
**X Alter:**
Are you trying to distance yourself from me, Master? Please allow me to stay by your side. I cannot live alone. 
 
**Agravain:**
I will not repeat myself. You need to find a proper job. 
 
**X Alter:**
...Ugh... 
 
**X Alter:**
Does that mean we're no longer going to communicate? 
 
**X Alter:**
...!? 
 
**Agravain:**
Hm... 
 
**Agravain:**
...That steam noise. I could never forget that sound. 
 
**X Alter:**
..Babbagen! That tin can running on steam has managed to reach our castle! 
 
**X Alter:**
That thing is truly the mortal enemy of all Villains. I shall slice it down with my dark sword! 
 
**Agravain:**
Evil Sacred Sword Necro-calibur... That blade shall one day cut through even a planet. 
 
**Agravain:**
But it still hasn't fully matured. We were foolish to believe in the specs written in the catalog. Honestly, internet shopping... 
 
**Agravain:**
No, that's not what I mean. We did not have enough time to provide you with all that is necessary. 
 
**Agravain:**
Learn, Alter. Go to a new land and search for a superior Master. 
 
**X Alter:**
I...I have yet to reward the enemy with a single blade of mine. 
 
**X Alter:**
I have put none of Master's teachings into practice. 
 
**X Alter:**
... (Gasp) Master...what are you&mdash; 
 
**Agravain:**
Alter. I am sealing away your memories. 
 
**X Alter:**
...! 
 
**X Alter:**
...Ungh...ahhh... 
 
**Agravain:**
This is the hidden skill called “Black Knight's Black Hand.” All who call themselves knights are shackled down by the rules of example. 
 
**X Alter:**
That's your favorite pestering Noble Phantasm, isn't it? But the Black Knight and Black Hand seem redundant. 
 
**Agravain:**
...Just ignore the minute details, okay? 
 
**Agravain:**
This skill shall take effect a few days from now. You will forget my name, as well. 
 
**Agravain:**
Go, Alter. 
 
**Agravain:**
You are Servant Universe's strongest and final Alter, and that truth shall be hidden from all. 
 
**X Alter:**
...Master... 
 
**Agravain:**
There's no need to be sad as we part with the promise of victory. May the Alternium be with you. 
 
**X Alter:**
Lord Agravain...! May you have good fortune in battle! 
 
**Agravain:**
... 
 
**X Alter:**
(Pant...pant...) Black Knight, are you there!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I don't know what's going on.)

---
 
**X Alter:**
I need you to navigate the escape pod. 
 
**X Alter:**
Otherwise, we're going to be space dust. 
 
**X Alter:**
The enemy...the machine soldiers...Babbagen's drones! 
 
**X Alter:**
Ah...I can't believe they've managed to invade our secret base! 
 
**X Alter:**
We need to break through! At any cost! Black Knight, I need your help! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Got it!)
 
**X Alter:**
What a cute response. It's like you're not Black Knight. 
 
**X Alter:**
Target the memory banks! No records shall be left! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Something seems wrong here... She just said Villain...)
 
**X Alter:**
Yep, Villain. It means enemy. Huh? Are you complaining again? 
 
**X Alter:**
Just because one's an enemy, that doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad guy. Just like how the hero may not always be a good guy. 
 
**X Alter:**
But what's important right now is that we need to fight or else it's game over. Let's go! 
 

---
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**X Alter:**
...Breaking away from Planet Lothian's gravitational pull. Warp preparations complete. 
 
**X Alter:**
Check the sensors to see if anyone is following us, Black Knight. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I don't know how to drive a spaceship...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Huh... I'm going in and out of consciousness...)

---
 
**X Alter:**
Are you all right? 
 
**X Alter:**
I was pretty sloppy erasing your confidential data, so maybe that's why you're acting funny. 
 
**X Alter:**
... 
 
**X Alter:**
Agravain...my lord... Goodbye, my ruthless Villain Master... 
 
**X Alter:**
May the Alternium be with you, always. 
 
## "Interlude Entracte II"
 
**X:**
 
(Munch munch) ... 
 
**X:**
...Delicious! My Altrium is getting cleansed! Meat buns in the winter sure taste like justice! 
 
**X:**
Even on a space colony, they create a man-made winter. I thought they were just stingy with the heating... 
 
**X:**
But this alone is praiseworthy! On the other hand, red bean buns taste like corruption! 
 
**X:**
One more... Hey! This is a red bean bun! Why that guy at Vamily Mart! 
 
**X:**
...Hmm? I sense a Saber approaching! 
 
**X:**
You there! You, in the sailor uniform, standing there mysteriously! Yes, you! 
 
**B：???:**
... 
 
**X:**
What? I'm not giving you one even if you stare at it! 
 
**X:**
Who are you? I don't know you, but you look familiar! This is mind-boggling! 
 
**X:**
Are you a Saber!? If you are, then you're gonna get blown away! 
 
**B：???:**
... 
 
**X:**
...Hm? Are you cold? And hungry? Your knees are shaking... Do you have altitude sickness? 
 
**X:**
... 
 
**X:**
I guess I have no choice. Consider yourself lucky you're not a Saber. And just one. You can only take one. 
 
**X:**
Come on, hold out your hand. Whoa! It's so cold! 
 
**B：???:**
... 
 
**B：???:**
... (Munch...munch...) 
 
**B：???:**
...So sweet...and warm... 
 
**X:**
...You must have been hungry. Well, I'm not sure that even counts as a good deed. 
 
**X:**
Out in the vastness of space, I hear there's even a hero who lets you eat his head. Could he be from the cosmic horror genre? 
 
**B：???:**
Where...am I...? 
 
**X:**
Did you come here without knowing? 
 
**X:**
You're at Cosmo-Chaldea High School. It's a school attended by many young students who dream of becoming tomorrow's SSR Servants. 
 
**B：???:**
Cosmo...Chaldea High...? 
 
**B：???:**
I heard of a place around here with a ton of elite Masters, but I guess this isn't it. 
 
**X:**
Master? There are plenty of annoying teachers. 
 
**C：???:**
You've ditched class to eat out, X? 
 
**X:**
Oh crap, Lionhead! 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
I am not currently known as Lionhead! I am God Bless Edison! GBE! 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
I am the very first principal of the glorious Cosmo-Chaldea High! 
 
**X:**
You don't have to roar so, cathead. I can hear you. I get it. 
 
**X:**
I just bumped into someone who I guess is a transfer student. I was about to give her a tour. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
A noble effort, but you still owe me 50,000 super gravity squats. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
So this is her? Hm, I did not receive any word about a transfer student... 
 
**X:**
Hey. What's your name, by the way? 
 
**B：???:**
My...name... 
 
**B：???:**
...Ex... 
 
**B：???:**
...Ex...ah... 
 
**X:**
“Ex”? Is it just “Ex”? What a short name! 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Look who's talking. 
 
**X:**
I like it. It's short and sweet! All right, Ex! 
 
**Ex:**
Ah...yes... That's...fine. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Very well. Ex. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
I know you must want to enroll in this school, but it doesn't accept just anybody. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
It's a school where heroic Servants are raised by experienced, active Servants working as teachers. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Thus, those who wish to enroll must have certain qualifications! 
 
**Ex:**
...Qualifications...? 
 
**X:**
Don't be stupid, principal! You were just complaining that the school is in the red because there were so many dropouts from the tough curriculum! 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Those are separate issues! As different as AC and DC! 
 
**X:**
I see. So, there's not much difference. 
 
**Ex:**
...I want...to enroll. I want to become a great Servant. 
 
**Ex:**
I'll make the tuition thing work. So...please... 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
It seems like your words are sincere. You have passed the first entrance exam. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
And while we're here. X, you be her opponent. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
We'll hold a mock battle. Based on the result of that, I shall judge whether you can enroll or not! 
 
**X:**
Okay... It seems wrong that a student is in charge of testing another student, but I guess this is just what comes with being an upperclassman. I'll do it. 
 
**X:**
...Heh. In other words, a part-time job with the school principal's full permission. I'll get at least a week's worth of lunch vouchers out of this! 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
No. If anything, this is a secret deal. You do know that buying food from outside vendors is prohibited. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
I'll turn a blind eye to it if you win. Also, if you lose to her, I will double your tuition. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Do you think that's unreasonable? No, call me a capitalistic gentleman! It just means you're going to be paying for her tuition as well! 
 
**X:**
So you're saying that whatever the outcome, the school won't lose anything, AND will gain another student! 
 
**X:**
Why you, what a sharp way of thinking! It's hard to believe you're a lion. Are you by chance human!? 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
I keep telling you I'm a human! Not having any toe beans is proof! 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Ah, no, that's not what I mean. Ex... 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
X may act rowdy like she does, ditch classes, and sometimes battle active Servants... 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
...but she is still our star pupil. She's pretty strong. She even uses ninja skills. Will you still fight? 
 
**Ex:**
Star... 
 
**Ex:**
Yes. I will. 
 
**Ex:**
X, please be my opponent! 
 
**X:**
I like that attitude! I'm not going to complain about my stomach being empty, but I wholeheartedly accept any newbies with spirit! 
 
**X:**
Ex, this is payback for that red bean bun! Bring it on! 
 
**Ex:**
I want to eat more sweet things! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Hm? Where am I?)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This...isn't Chaldea.)

---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I...I'm in this Voloid body again!?)

---
 
**X:**
Ah...darn! 
 
**X:**
Unayaaaaaabarubarubarumo! 
 
**X:**
Special intense lectures by Nameless Red are so boring, I can't stand it! 
 
**X:**
Doubling my tuition would've been a hundred times better&mdash;Ouch! 
 
**X:**
Arrrgh, there's a dent on my shin now! Hmph! 
 
**X:**
Why is there a weird black bucket in my room? 
 
**X:**
What are you, a Voloid? Are you an invention of Professor Babbagen? You are! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(No! Ouch!)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(X, it's me!)

---
 
**X:**
...Hmmm, I feel something in the Altrium. A presence I haven't felt since... 
 
**X:**
...Sorry. It doesn't look like you're a defective Voloid, but electricity doesn't come free. 
 
**X:**
Um, when do the waste collectors collect trash Voloids? 
 
**Ex:**
Bullying...is bad. Sometimes...it gets confused. 
 
**X:**
Hm...Ex. You still need something? 
 
**Ex:**
That thing is with me. It's my only possession. 
 
**Ex:**
We're going to be roommates starting today. Please be kind to me, X. 
 
**X:**
... 
 
**X:**
Huh!? Nobody told me this! A roommate!? 
 
**X:**
I had...a single room all to myself, something that can't normally be enjoyed on backwater planets! My sweet, private school life...! 
 
**Ex:**
These were the orders from the student support division, so there's no mistake. Besides, this room is obviously big enough for two students. 
 
**Ex:**
Everything on this side of the line is my territory. This space will be our common area. 
 
**Ex:**
Also I'm going to pull this juice bottle out of our fridge. My snacks won't fit with that inside. 
 
**X:**
You're rolling the bottle of super extreme explosive carbonated drink, Space Sipep! Th-that'll cause an explosion! 
 
**X:**
Now that I look closely, you look a lot like me! No wonder I did so poorly in that mock battle! 
 
**X:**
Even though I held back! You really went all-out on me, and it hurt! 
 
**Ex:**
That... Likewise. Thank you. 
 
**Ex:**
There will be the two of us here from now on, so I ask you to be quieter, please. 
 
**X:**
What the... Are you taking over the room already!? Instead of waiting for you to sleep, maybe I'll slice you up right now! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Um, no fighting, please.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(She already has her sword out!)

---
 
**Ex:**
Careful. Black Knight, stand back. You might get caught in X's weak beam crossfires. 
 
**X:**
Are you calling my sword moves “weak beams”? Tsk. I didn't realize you were a Servant of sick burns. Are you perhaps a literary genius? 
 
**X:**
Hmph, as a science buff, I don't think you and I could get along. I suggest you move to another room&mdash; 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(X is more versed in physical sports.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Haha, science buff... Good one.)

---
 
**X:**
Here's a lesson for you! Physical punishment! I saw it in your eyes! 
 
**X:**
Why you! Why are you protecting that Voloid!? 
 
**Ex:**
Because Black Knight is correct. And your reaction. You just said it yourself! 
 
**X:**
You may be a nerd, but your swordsmanship is spot-on. I actually sense that you have some formal training in your background. 
 
**X:**
Heh... Heh, heh. Interesting! 
 
**X:**
Whether you be an Assassin or Berserker, if you're a Saberface, then you're definitely a Saber! 
 
**X:**
Okay then, I'm going to get serious now! I don't have anything against you, but I will cut down all Sabers! 
 
**Ex:**
No&mdash; That's right, I'm a Saber! Fine! That's how it will be! 
 
**Ex:**
By thinking that, I feel like a burden has been lifted...I think. 
 
**X:**
I understand that feeling very well! But give up, because your Saber days are over! 
 
**Girls' Dorm Supervisor:**
 
You two are too noisy! 
 
**Girls' Dorm Supervisor:**
Stop your fighting! If you don't, I'll put you both in swimsuits, strap you to my Noble Phantasm, and shoot you around the third moon! 
 
**Girls' Dorm Supervisor:**
...Hey, I kicked something. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Waaahhh, I'm rolling! Stop me! Stop me!)

---
 
**X:**
Huh? 
 
**X:**
Ah. I cut the little guy down on accident! Sorry! I'm really sorry! Are you all right? 
 
**Ex:**
Black Knight... 
 
**:**
And thus the two fake Sabers began their life together. 　　　　Roommates. Roomshare. Saber rival. 
 
**:**
At times they would fight over pudding. At times they would guess what would be on the test using darts and share a laugh... 
 
**:**
Ex would be scolded by the dorm supervisor for staying up past midnight reading, and X for sneaking in outside food... 
 
**:**
They would spend a difficult, yet fulfilling school life together. 
 
## "Interlude Entracte III"
 
**:**
No matter what they said, the two fake Sabers living together were friendly, but fought tons. And so it continued. 
 
**:**
　　　　　　　　　　　　However... 
 
**Ex:**
... 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
She is still not back. 
 
**Ex:**
Principal... 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
It's been so long since we last heard Du Stallion II's jets. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
We know so far that her disappearance has something to do with the irregular increase in Heroine Zs. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
But we haven't seen Heroine X. How sad and lonesome... 
 
**Ex:**
Eradicating Heroine Z was hard work. I still question what that Saber ninja evade move was. 
 
**Ex:**
And ever since X disappeared, the Saber class students are all sighing with relief. 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Hmm... 
 
**God Bless Edison:**
Knowing her, she must be off saving some world in crisis. All while having no idea people are wondering where she is. 
 
**Ex:**
I'm...just worried about all the “use by” dates on her food in the fridge. 
 
**Ex:**
What should we do...Black Knight...? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Oh no, not this mind-only warp again!)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(She seems sad...?)

---
 
**Ex:**
I've been having fuzzy memories lately. 
 
**Ex:**
Some pretty men are sitting around a black round table, and they're drinking. And I'm just sitting there, looking bored... 
 
**Ex:**
Then then someone special to me secretly gives me candy. It tasted sweet... 
 
**Ex:**
But then the hotties disappear from their seats at the round table one by one, like petals dropping from a wilting flower. 
 
**Ex:**
The quiet round table wasn't bad. As long as that one man was there. 
 
**Ex:**
Being in my empty room reminds me of that scene. 
 
**Ex:**
A knock. ...Come in. 
 
**Ex:**
...? 
 
**Ex:**
Why aren't you coming in? Is the door broken? 
 
**B：???:**
I'm just killing time in the halls, Lizardlet. 
 
**B：???:**
I don't mind people seeing us talking, but I don't want our conversation to be recorded. 
 
**Ex:**
You're disguising your voice? Who are you? What do you want? 
 
**B：???:**
I'll just say that I'm a classmate. Spies for the Villain Alliance are everywhere. 
 
**B：???:**
Even in this school of heroic Servants. 
 
**Ex:**
Villain...Alliance... Inside the school... 
 
**Ex:**
...In a way, I'm relieved. You seem to be an elite agent. 
 
**Ex:**
Not like that striped-pants Elisa, who always herself caught in the traps she sets for X and me. 
 
**Ex:**
I was so worried she might be the spy. But it looks like I was wrong. 
 
**B：???:**
 
Gwah! A-ahem! 
 
**B：???:**
...They will soon come for you. Be ready to meet them. 
 
**B：???:**
I'm talking about those who believe you have fighting potential, after the reports they've received from spies here. 
 
**B：???:**
A large-scale attack by the Villains will soon start. It'll be a Death Tour, with enough power to destroy an entire planet. 
 
**B：???:**
Heroine X will likely not return. And even if she did, she could not save this place. 
 
**B：???:**
See you, docile Berserker. School life with you was quite entertaining. 
 
**Ex:**
... 
 
**Ex:**
Leave...the school... 
 
**Ex:**
I knew that this day, would come. I didn't think X would be first. But. 
 
**Ex:**
But...there is still something I need to do. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I have a bad feeling about this...)
 
**Ex:**
You don't have to be so worried, Black Knight. 
 
**Ex:**
I secretly collected parts bit by bit, so you've powered up quite a bit. 
 
**Ex:**
If you can help me again...that would be great. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Ex wears leggings...)
 
**Ex:**
Black Knight...your eye movements are a little creepy. 
 
**Ex:**
Maybe there's still some weird programming left. I'm going to change, so go out in the hall. 
 
**Ex:**
Come on, hurry. 
 

---
 
**Babbagen:**
Beep boop. So you were the one who called me out here to the dark side of the school. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Data extraction. Found: a traditional school yard callout to settle old scores. In other words, there's an one hundred percent possibility that a secret art will be passed on due to graduation. 
 
**Babbagen:**
...Good. Preparing to deploy Noble Phantasm for self-defense. 
 
**Babbagen:**
With my fantasy, my ideal, my dream...the time has come for you to awaken to the appeal of steam! 
 
**Ex:**
...No, that's not what we're talking about. I wanted to ask you some personal questions before the battle started, Professor Babbagen. 
 
**Ex:**
I know you are busy, and you are not around the school much. Tonight was my only chance. 
 
**Babbagen:**
...Hm. Steam pressure...dropping. What kind of lecture do you desire, Servant candidate? 
 
**Ex:**
Please tell me... 
 
**Ex:**
On the planet Lothian, I believe you once battled against a dark lord. 
 
**Ex:**
That information is strictly confidential, and it is not even in the school's database. Could you tell me the details... 
 
**Ex:**
And tell me what fate befell the black lord!? 
 
**Babbagen:**
Confidential data, number SA80T521X. Punitive expedition of the planet Lothian. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Such information is strictly confidential. Of course, revealing such information to a common student candidate is not permissible. 
 
**Ex:**
All right, then! I have no choice but to tear our your memory media and read it myself! 
 
**Ex:**
And...above all... 
 
**Ex:**
My heart...is burning and screaming at me that I need to defeat you! 
 
**Babbagen:**
Hm. I am a gentleman, and a scholar who abhors physical violence. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Yet I am also aware that I must defend myself against any attack. Student or not, I will not hold back. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Your burning heart... Show me if it can best my steam power armor! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Babbagen:**
...Left and right manipulators...stopped. I have sustained critical damage. 
 
**Babbagen:**
...Candidate Ex. 
 
**Ex:**
Yes, Professor Babbagen. 
 
**Babbagen:**
You were a good student. A truly good student. You were one of the few who sincerely listened to my lectures. 
 
**Babbagen:**
You sat in front of the class, and I remember you always wiping your fogged up glasses. 
 
**Ex:**
...It was tough. It was as tough as eating mochi topped with powdered chestnut without hands... 
 
**Babbagen:**
...You have utterly defeated me. 
 
**Babbagen:**
You so accurately pinpointed my armor's weaknesses. I can think of no better sign that you studied well. 
 
**Babbagen:**
I do not have enough information to understand the entire situation, but I can hypothesize about the outcome. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Ex, you are planning to leave, are you not? 
 
**Ex:**
Professor, I... 
 
**Ex:**
I just couldn't like you. I couldn't help this hatred I felt toward you. 
 
**Ex:**
But I always liked your lectures. I truly did. 
 
**Babbagen:**
...Ah, a student completes her studies and departs. That is every teacher's joy... 
 
**Babbagen:**
As your reward, I shall tell you. The dark lord's name is... “Sir Agravain.” 
 
**Ex:**
Agra...vain...! 
 
**Babbagen:**
He was a senior member of the group called the Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. 
 
**Babbagen:**
As the descendant of a clan that alchemizes artificial Servants, the work he inherited was truly evil. 
 
**Babbagen:**
The Heroine Zs earlier were just incomplete fakes. What he was searching for was something beyond that... A crystallized form of magecraft. 
 
**Babbagen:**
But we have been able to determine that he was not successful. 
 
**Ex:**
... 
 
**Babbagen:**
Agravain fought valiantly, but he was no match for the overwhelming pressure of my steam. 
 
**Babbagen:**
In the end, he tumbled down into the castle's reactor core. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Whether it was accidental or intentional, I cannot say. 
 
**Babbagen:**
Not long after, the castle collapsed. 
 
**Babbagen:**
We conducted a thorough search, but were unable to locate his body. 
 
**Babbagen:**
At the same time, the secret ceremonial rites for the creation of artificial Servants were also lost. That's what I...report...ed. 
 
**Ex:**
Professor...Professor Babbagen. 
 
**Ex:**
...Ungh. 
 
**Ex:**
Agravain...Agravain...! 
 
**Ex:**
My Master... Revenge...! 
 
**Ex:**
... 
 
**Ex:**
...It's impossible... 
 
**???:**
Aren't you going to finish him off? Wouldn't that be more elegant? 
 
**Ex:**
...! 
 
**???:**
Encased within his armor, the critical steam will release, cutting off his vision and breathing, and soon after, a world of extreme cold will await him. 
 
**???:**
He's an extremely troublesome enemy. 
 
**???:**
...iii... 
 
**Ex:**
...Are you the one who is here to get me, as the agent said? 
 
**???:**
...Indeed, Lord Pendragon. 
 
**???:**
The final knight of the fallen Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. ...To think you would be hiding here, right under his nose. 
 
**???:**
...Hmph. The villain may not always be evil, while the “good guy” may not always be working for the weak. 
 
**???:**
A school intended to educate heroic Servants? Laughable. You know that the moment it becomes a public facility, it also becomes a pawn of those in power, don't you? 
 
**???:**
Never mind. Now we need to think of how to deal with you, Lord Pendragon. 
 
**???:**
The reports said you had lost your memories, but by the look of it, you seem to understand what is going on. 
 
**Ex:**
Pendragon... Yes, that is the True Name I was given. 
 
**X Alter:**
My name is Heroine X Alter. The Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon! 
 
**???:**
Hahahahaha! Wonderful. Let us celebrate your new journey! 
 
**???:**
I welcome you as a new member of the Villain Alliance. You shall serve me directly! 
 
**???:**
Admittedly, I am an outsider within the Alliance. But that means you will have absolute freedom in your job! What a wonderful position! 
 
**X Alter:**
...I see. I'm actually more keen on being told what to do. 
 
**X Alter:**
But I do have one wish. 
 
**X Alter:**
I would like to take one Voloid with me. AUX Voloid K6-X4. 
 
**???:**
Hm? What a piece of junk. Fine. Doesn't look like much, though. 
 
**???:**
Board my container-shaped infiltration ship. We will return at once to the mothership, and convene with the other alliance members. 
 
**X Alter:**
Please, give me ninety seconds to prepare. 
 
**???:**
Understood. I will await you in the ship. 
 
**X Alter:**
...Black Knight. I have...something to ask you. 
 
**X Alter:**
I finally figured out what was wrong with you. 
 
**X Alter:**
You have a tiny shard of crystallized Alternium embedded in your head. It was being used to track me. 
 
**X Alter:**
That crystal had been receiving mana waves leaking through the cracks of multidimensional space. 
 
**X Alter:**
It seems, coincidentally, that you were on the same wavelength as someone else's mind. They would appear to be a mage. 
 
**X Alter:**
But we are headed to a battlefield. Information leaks and unknown elements cannot be permitted. 
 
**X Alter:**
I'm going to remove the cause of the problem. 
 
**X Alter:**
Maybe you're still listening to my words through this Black Knight as a vessel. 
 
**X Alter:**
If you are...I would like to say goodbye. 
 
**X Alter:**
Having someone listen to me when I needed it... I think that was nice. 
 
**X Alter:**
When I succeed, and make a name for myself as a Servant...maybe we can talk like this again. 
 
**X Alter:**
When that time comes... 
 
**X Alter:**
No, that's just wishful thinking. She and my deceased Master would both laugh at that thought. 
 
**X Alter:**
See you. Whoever it is, from a Servant Universe far, far away... 
 
**X Alter:**
May the Alternium be with you, always...

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Whoa! Chaldea!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did I fall asleep?

---
 
**X:**
Have you awoken, Master? How was sleeping at the nice warm kotatsu? 
 
**X:**
It was good? I'm glad to hear! But Mash seems to be a little disappointed. 
 
**Mash:**
...! 
 
**X:**
She seems to have kind of made a hobby of watching Master sleep. I don't understand that allure at all! 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, ah! Shhhhh. X, I told you to please keep that a secret...! 
 
**Mash:**
This kotatsu we inherited from Doctor's room is a Noble Phantasm to be feared! 
 
**Mash:**
Um... It's so that Senpai will remain healthy... 
 
**X:**
Let's just keep it that way. This mikan is delicious! This iyokan citrus is sour! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Heroine X... I just saw someone with your face?
 
**X:**
What? Is there something on my face? (Sigh) Fine. Then have a good look at it. 
 
**Mash:**
H-hey! Please! Both of you! Your faces are too close! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This one wears bloomers...)
 
**X:**
Wha...? This is a special spacesuit! It's a wardrobe essential for those who follow the Star of Altria! 
 
**X:**
Well, they were on sale at the school's store, so I bought them all up. 
 
**Mash:**
What are you talking about? 
 

---
 
**Mash:**
(Sigh) ...Master, were you dreaming? Eh? Not a dream!? 
 
**Mash:**
Hm...hm... Those are some hazy details. 
 
**X:**
Eh? Did I ever have a BFF? 
 
**X:**
Oh, come on. I don't remember anything like that. Sounds like space opera nonsense to me! 
 
**X:**
But...yeah. I did have someone I considered a troublesome rival. 
 
**X:**
Oh? You want to hear all about it? Uh... Well, it's not really an interesting story... 
 
**X:**
It's not like I defeated a space dragon, or won first place in a race through the Saint Quartz Run... 
 
**X:**
This story isn't as flashy as all that. It's just a story about ordinary school life. 
 
**X:**
Sheesh. I wonder how she's doing... That Saber who was energized by Japanese sweets... 
 
**X:**
No, no. Forget about that. Let's talk about releasing the long-awaited EPII! 
 
**X:**
I got excited thinking this quest was going to be about that, so I've been waiting patiently next to Master this whole time! 
 
**Mash:**
I-is that so? Anyway, it looks like you are still going to be talking. 
 
**Mash:**
We have run out of both mikan and tea, so I shall go get some more. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Mash. What would you like, X?

---
 
**X:**
Any Japanese sweets. We are sitting at a kotatsu, after all. 
 
**X:**
Sometimes the flavor of corruption isn't so bad! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, understood. I shall go check the kitchen!
