# Trial Quest - Parvati

## A Lady Descends to Fuyuki
 
**Mash:**
All systems green. Rayshift is a success. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Good, good. Now then, Fujimaru. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Let me go over this again: you're in Fuyuki, a rural Japanese city. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're here to investigate the odd reading we got in this area. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
So...see anything? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anything or anyone that seems out of place or that catches your attention in your general vicinity? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's see...

---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There is a woman...dressed in Indian attire...

---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, good work, Fujimaru. Looks like you got it in one! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
She's definitely the source of the odd reading we got. Looks like she's a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
But she is no ordinary Servant. I'm getting a Divine Spirit response from her. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh-ho. I knew this would be a special case since Sheba interpreted it as irregular when we detected it, but I never imagined it would be a Divine Spirit Servant. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
She doesn't seem hostile, but we don't know what's going to happen. Proceed with caution, Fujimaru. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay... Um, excuse me, do you have a moment?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hello. You there. Can I speak to you for a bit...?

---
 
**A：???:**
!? Eh? Uh, yes...? Wh-what is it!? 
 
**A：???:**
Um, I know I've been wandering around the same spot for a while now... 
 
**A：???:**
So of course you think I'm suspicious, but I promise I am absolutely not a shady sort! 
 
**A：???:**
...Oh? 
 
**A：???:**
... 
 
**A：???:**
Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but... 
 
**A：???:**
Are you by chance a Master who has formed a contract with a Servant...? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Indeed I am.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I contract with lots of Servants.

---
 
**A：???:**
Oh, wonderful. Then I don't have to explain all the basics to you. 
 
**A：???:**
I'm not the least bit shady. I am&ndash;get this&ndash;a wayward Servant who has nothing to hide! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, thanks for that polite explanation. But it's not just about being polite. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
(She acts like the passive type, but she's got a heck of a stubborn attitude...) 
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Despite her appearance, she's almost certainly no pushover. Be careful, Fujimaru) 
 
**Mash:**
That's not nice, Da Vinci. She was honest about being a wayward Servant... 
 
**Mash:**
And while I know neither her circumstances, nor her True Name, I am sure she is a wonderful Servant! 
 
**A：???:**
Oh, are they your friends? It's nice to be in such a lively group. 
 
**A：???:**
They are transmitting their voices from somewhere across both space and time...am I correct? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, that's a great interpretation. It's nice to have a Divine Spirit who's quick on the uptake. 
 
**A：???:**
You can tell I'm a Divine Spirit...a goddess Servant? Even with my weakened Spirit Origin? 
 
**Mash:**
Y-yes. It's difficult to explain, but we have encountered our share of goddesses. And every one of them has been pretty...distinctive... 
 
**A：???:**
Oh my. What wonderful encounters. You must have gone through intensive training. 
 
**A：???:**
I don't know which goddesses you encountered, nor do I know what kind of humans were used as vessels... 
 
**A：???:**
But since you already understand the basics, I see no reason to hide my identity. Allow me to formally introduce myself: 
 
**A：???:**
I am Pārvatī. I've manifested here using this girl's body as a vessel... She is someone to whom I am attuned in both body and soul. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pārvatī...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A vessel? So, a Pseudo-Servant!?
 

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Yes. It has been something of a confluence of coincidences. 
 
**Mash:**
Pārvatī is a famous goddess from Indian myth. 
 
**Mash:**
She is the divine wife of Shiva, and is the embodiment of kindness and grace. She doesn't seem to be a dangerous Divine Spirit, which is a relief. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. If that woman is really Pārvatī, you're not in immediate danger. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
After all, there really aren't any myths about Pārvatī doing battle. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Goddesses tend to be pretty fickle. They just love punishing humans at even the slightest hint of provocation or disrespect. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But as long as she is truly Pārvatī, anything dark&ndash;Wait a minute... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
A goddess who's portfolio includes beauty and gentleness... This is bad. Really bad! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Because she's not a goddess of war and beauty, but she's exclusively a goddess of beauty! She's the same! The same as me! 
 
**Mash:**
...Let's just put Da Vinci's antics aside... 
 
**Mash:**
I'm curious about the individual who became her vessel. Um, excuse me, Miss Pārvatī... 
 
**Mash:**
May I ask what has happened to the owner of that body of yours? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You're asking about the state of this body's owner... I didn't think you would ask that question so quickly... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You're bold, though you seem mild-mannered. Or, at least, you're certainly cautious. You have the kouhai thing going on, and we have similar personalities... 
 
**Mash:**
Um, Miss Pārvatī? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Nothing. Were I in your shoes, I would have asked the same question. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
The original owner of this body is not here. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
That is... She isn't asleep, and she hasn't been destroyed or anything... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Being a Divine Spirit, this is embarrassing to admit, but she and I merged together seamlessly♡ 
 
**Mash:**
M-merged!? D-does that mean... 
 
**Mash:**
The human girl's soul...um, embraced the Divine Spirit Pārvatī...or rather, didn't lose to you...? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, I know... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I may not be a god of war, but even so, to be able to retake control from a Divine Heroic Spirit...I'm speechless myself. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
This body is...well, it's basically me now. You know, I'm told that I am gloomy, scary, strong-willed... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
My memories and behavior are all Pārvatī, but expressed through her personality. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
We combined our good aspects and cut away the bad parts in a sort of mutual consensus, creating a new Pseudo-Servant. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
The girl's past and memories were sealed when we merged. After all, no human can bear the full weight of a god's mind and memories. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But in exchange, my preferences and decision-making were all entrusted to her human nature. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
This may be hard to understand, but...let's see... Are you familiar with the concept of magical girls? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I'm not too far off from that concept. It's a temporary state I can't change back from, but were I to do so, I would forget everything as soon as I did. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Magical girl...I get it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know much about magical girls,but I think I get the idea.
 

---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm. I figured we'd find a vessel once I knew we were dealing with a Divine Spirit, but this is a pretty far cry from what we saw in Uruk. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
In that case, it was a goddess using a human as her core, but this seems to be a human using a goddess as her own core. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Either way, that girl must have some sort of connection with the Holy Grail and Servants. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Typically, the human the god's compatible with is just used as a vessel. The god puts a small part of their power into the vessel and kind of forces their way into that person to manifest as a Servant. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
At least, that's how it usually works for a Pseudo-Servant. You seem to be something of a special case, though. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But ultimately, you're not really much different from the other Divine Spirits in Chaldea. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, so there are others like me. That's good to know. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I'm not particularly comfortable with excessive fear or worship from those around me. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I would very much like for you to interact with me naturally, just like how you treat anyone else. 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you for your concern, Pārvatī. By the way&ndash; 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, you can call me Par. My name is kind of long and a bit hard to say, don't you think? 
 
**Mash:**
O-okay... I'm a little apprehensive about that, but... Very well, Par... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Okay! Hee hee. This is my first time going by a nickname. I'm really being quite sociable, aren't I? That makes me happy. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
The owner of this body and I are both naturally very shy. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But by combining the best parts of ourselves, I believe we're better able to speak our mind and not be so timid. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
We can assert ourselves and say what we like. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Just that fact makes this manifestation worth it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, Par...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's a goddess like you doing in a place like this?

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh yes, I forgot! There's no time for me to be standing around here being all happy! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Um, well, simply put, I'm looking for something. I know it's around here somewhere. 
 
**Mash:**
You mean in Fuyuki, during this age? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Yes. This city seems to have some sort of connection to my body... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And so I thought that if I wandered this place, I would eventually come across it... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But this Fuyuki seems to be different than the one my body is familiar with... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Embarrassing as it is to admit, I seem to have gotten lost and landed myself in a bit of a bind... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...
 
**Mash:**
Now that we know what's going on, what do you think, Senpai? Should we help out Par? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. If that's her reason for being there, granting her wish will definitely lead us to some answers. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Want us to help?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. We do have some connection with Fuyuki, and we can provide a bit of backup from here. 
 
**Mash:**
We may be able to be of some help. 
 

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Well, if you really want to, then I'd welcome it! But...are you sure you want to help me? We only just met. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nod)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Give a thumbs up)

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, what kindhearted people you are! I must show my appreciation for your generosity! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...Oh, my apologies. I have yet to learn your names. May I ask what they are? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm Fujimaru.

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Fujimaru. So your name is Fujimaru... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Yes, I think that is a wonderful name. Pleased to meet you, Fujimaru! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And...Miss Mash and Miss Genius Da Vinci! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
So the thing you're looking for...do you have any other clues other than that it's in this city? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Um...no... This is more of an instinctual thing, so I think I would know if it were nearby... 
 
**Mash:**
Then we have no choice but to search the area. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's map out the area, and we'll keep track of where you've covered as you do it. 
 
**Mash:**
This could take awhile, but if you just do it bit by bit, I'm sure we'll find what Par is looking for eventually. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Wow...and I thought you were the same sort as me, but you take initiative much more than I do, Mash! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But that is very promising! Running into you is the best thing that could have happened to me here. I'm so lucky! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Now let's get going! I'm counting on everyone! 
 
**Mash:**
By the way, Par, that thing you're carrying... Is that a lance? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh yeah, I was wondering the same. Your Class is Lancer, right? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But I've never heard of Pārvatī carrying a lance... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, you're right. This actually isn't mine. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I borrowed it from my husband, Shiva. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, that's Shiva's trident, Trishula? So that's why you're a Lancer. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Since I'm only borrowing it, I can't do nearly as much with it as Shiva could. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And I customized it a little so I could use it easier. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It's probably far from what a lance should look like... Well, no, it's probably just not as cool because I'm the one who customized it. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I...may be a goddess, but I'm kind of a klutz. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ummm...
 
**Mash:**
No, that's not true! No matter how clumsy you are, I am sure you're a very diligent worker, Par! 
 
**Mash:**
I have absolutely no reason to believe that, but I'm certain of it because...because I feel such a close connection with you! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Mash! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're no klutz! You're beautiful, goddess!
 
**Pārvatī:**
R-really? You think so!? You speak so much more passionately than I could... You make me blush! 
 

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
But hearing you say that about me gives me so much confidence! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I may not have as much firepower as Shiva, but since I've manifested... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
That proves that I am a full-fledged Lancer Servant! Hi-yah! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hi-yah...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um... What was that wobbly move?
 

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
It's...it's a “hi-yah!” It's what all martial artists shout...! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...Ungh. Drat. You're doubting me now, aren't you? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I know I'm a beginner at being a Lancer, but I am still a goddess! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I may not look cool, but I'm definitely really strong when I fight. Probably. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
If an enemy comes, I'll just slap, slap, slap them. Like this! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I may borrow Shiva's power, but I still plan on doing it my way: by being splendid and graceful! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Don't worry. I won't summon any weird shadows or anything! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Eh? (What does she mean by “weird shadows”?) 
 
**Mash:**
(I think she's trying to show that she's strong, in her own way...) 
 
**Mash:**
(It might be rude of me to say this, but she seems more elegant and cute, really...) 
 
**Mash:**
(A goddess will always be a goddess, I suppose...) 
 
**Pārvatī:**
That's why, even if we encounter enemies on our way, there's nothing to worry about, Fujimaru. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You were all kind when I was in a tough spot. Now, I swear on my honor as a goddess...I will protect you all! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm... Normally, you wouldn't expect much from a goddess like Pārvatī in a melee battle... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But it's a different story if you consider the mythology surrounding her. If you trace her roots, you'll find quite the warlike&ndash; 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh? That's... 
 
**Mash:**
Is that...Cursed Arm over there? 
 
**Mash:**
It looks like he's doing something shifty by the road. I wonder... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
... 
 
**Mash:**
Par? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I'm not sure, but...I sense something. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
He is a bad man. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, that might be TECHNICALLY true in terms of alignment... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I feel that...we need to proceed with extreme caution. This feeling is bubbling up within me... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And, what should I call it... It's just a vague association, but there's a smell on him that bothers me... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It's like...this terrible...smell of bugs...? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It's all very instinctual, and I can't express it very well... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But anyway! The fact of the matter is that he is an evil man! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And a goddess like me simply cannot allow that to stand! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Fuuu...haaa (deep breaths)... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Hold it right there, suspicious masked man! 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Oh? Are you perhaps addressing me? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, you're the only masked man around!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well... If those weirdo Island Masks were around...
 

---
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hahaha. Very true. What business do you have with me? 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
I see a young lady who has been glaring at me for the past few minutes... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
As I believe that sincere words will reach even those who are evil, I will ask you this: 
 
**Pārvatī:**
What are you doing here? 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
What am I doing? Hmmm, now that I think of it, that is quite a profound question. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Many factors have led me here. However, to put it simply... 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Perhaps it is best to say that I am disposing of those who are empty, or those who've lost their place... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Wh-what did you say!? 
 
**Mohawk:**
Heh heh heh... Sir! I've found some! There's a ton over by the river! 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Oh, so it seems... Let's head over right away. This is very exciting, hahaha... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
H-he even has some mean-looking minions...! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
They have some nerve. I mean...wait a minute! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I know that the modern world is full of wicked, soulless people who have lost their way! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But even so, as a goddess, they are all my beloved children! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I will not turn a blind eye to the senseless murder of innocents! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Stay right where you are, you murdering assassin. It's probably not hard to tell, but I am mad! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Tremble)

---
 
**Mash:**
That look on Par's face...! She's intimidating even for a goddess! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Bingo. Pārvatī is usually described only as Shiva's wife...a goddess who is very mild-mannered... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But since she is Shiva's wife, Pārvatī is often identified with his OTHER wife, Durga, who is the goddess of battle... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
And on top of that, she is also identified as Kali, who was born from the two gods. Long story short, if you get Pārvatī mad, she's terrifying! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
This is no time for idle chatter. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
If you are truly a disciple of justice, you cannot let these evil men walk free! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Now come, Fujimaru! We must give these nasty, bug-smelling murderers divine punishment! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Ugh! There's no reason to fight to the death here! I'll just be the bigger man and say you got me! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh my... You're a lot more accommodating than I expected. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
So that horrid, filthy scent of insects was just something that rubbed off onto you? You must scrub hard to get the smell off of you, understood? 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Well, not really, but men, put your weapons down. Do as this woman says. 
 
**Mohawk:**
Damn! Why!? 
 
**Mohawk:**
But we just met you, our mentor...and we were on the verge of bettering ourselves... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bettering yourselves?

---
 
**Mash:**
Um...I'm going to ask you again. 
 
**Mash:**
What were you doing here? Can you tell us again? 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
...? I don't remember lying to you, so my answer has not changed. I'm disposing of those that are empty&mdash; 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, can you please clarify? Without the poetic assassin phrasing... 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hm...so it wasn't clear, huh? Well, let me put it in plainer terms... 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
We were picking up all the empty bottles and cans people left here. What of it? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But you're a Hassan!!! 
 
**Mash:**
What does that matter? 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
I had some time on my hands, so I pick up things that can be recycled. I'm the sort who collects all the daggers I throw from the battlefield. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
And this habit has left it somewhat painful for me to see the culture of fast consumption in this age. It can be so terribly wasteful. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
After a while, the young men who had time and shared in my beliefs gathered here and began to assemble and volunteer their time to assist me. 
 
**Mohawk:**
Yeah...our mentor became known for turning our delinquent ways around for the better... 
 
**Mohawk:**
Hawkmo from third street even landed his dream job at an IT company...and I am also going to start work at this company called Gold Mansomething. 
 
**Mohawk:**
You shouldn't judge people by their looks, you know... What matters is leading an honest, hardworking life! 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Hahaha. Indeed. They can save face and regain something of an identity. Heh. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
(Grr... I don't know why, but he gets on my nerves. Maybe we had a connection in our past lives...) 
 
**Mohawk:**
Can I keep talking? Um... 
 
**Mohawk:**
Right. Even if he was judged by his looks, no matter what his past was, our mentor's unwavering spirit to keep going was what attracted us to him. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Heh, you think too much of me, boy. But a little flattery never hurt anyone. Keep going. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But...you're still an assassin, correct? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Aren't you the bad guy of all bad guys who, under the orders of a bug-smelling Master, killed both humans and Servants!? 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
...? I don't quite know what you mean. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Yes, I am an assassin...a nominally evil being. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
But now, I am first and foremost the Servant of Master Fujimaru. 
 
**Cursed Arm:**
Without being ordered to do so, I would certainly never attack at random. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I forgot to mention...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But Hassan is actually a nice guy.

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
...!!! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...A-ah... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Such a thing is possible!? I'm terribly sorry! I am such klutz in every possible way! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh...I can't believe I did that... I feel just awful... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't think too much about it...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No worries! It happens!

---
 
**Mash:**
Master is right, Par. 
 
**Mash:**
Anyone can make mistakes, you know! Even Hassan laughed it off and forgave you! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That said, we were all a bit shocked at how mad you got! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You too, right, Fujimaru? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That incredible&ndash;if dark&ndash;fighting spirit that was practically pouring from you...it sure reinforced that you are definitely a god! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now I know not to make you mad.

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Please don't talk about it! All that anger and it was just a misunderstanding... I'm so embarrassed... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Ahem... Well, there's one tiny bit of silver lining! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Compared to what happens when I'm REALLY angry, that was just the tip of the iceberg. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Fortunately, since I'm a Pseudo-Servant, I am one hundred percent good, wholesome goddess! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I won't let that destructive negativity out so easily! 
 
**Mash:**
Um, are you trying to say that your REAL anger is even more intense than what we saw? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...(Smile) 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That wasn't much of an answer,but let's try not to tick her off.

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
No, you don't have to worry too much. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
What I mean is that you will never see my true fury. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
What I'm looking for isn't around here... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Maybe it is that I'm still unused to this since I just manifested... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh hey, I meant to ask you. Why did you manifest in the first place? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Does it have to do with what you're looking for? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, no. What I'm seeking is more of a bonus. Or, well, it's sort of all in my mind. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
There is a legitimate reason for my manifestation. It's very difficult to put into words though... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But let's see...it feels like there is something that I must do... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm. If you manifested as a Servant, that means you will need a Master to help you accomplish whatever it is you want to do. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
What do you think? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I can very confidently put forward Fujimaru as highly recommended Master. 
 
**Mash:**
I agree wholeheartedly. Senpai truly is a reliable Master. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
R-right. I completely forgot. A Servant needs a Master. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Fujimaru is...of course, a pure and just individual. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You're right. It would be best for me to continue receiving Fujimaru's support... (Stare) 
 
**A：???:**
Wait, wait, wait!!! You're not getting away! Pink aerial stunts are a no-no! 
 
**Mash:**
Ah! That voice...? 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
(Providing minimal explanation) I'm pawtrolling my territory... That's right, it's mew! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A wild animal appears!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yep, pretty much a cat. Sneaking in without being called.

---
 
**Mash:**
Jaguar Warrior? Why are you here? 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Shut up, you purrpetrator! This is Jaguar's territory! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Power over life and death...love and death...fish or beef! Know that everything hinges on the whims of the mistress of this territory...ME! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Teacher...! That is such an absurd role! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Um...I actually don't know why I called that thing a teacher... It just came out! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Of course you did. This Jaguar actually stands above all living creatures to be an example to all! I'm the ultimate creature of eduCATion! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I'm gonna give you a snippet of truth! Eating meat makes you super happy, and naptime is the doorway to your dreams! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh. I tried to make it sound Nirvana-y because there's an Indian goddess in front of me. What do you think? No good? Aww...I see. 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Whatever. I'm being super generous today! Take a look at Student No. EX, who also worships me! 
 
**Illya:**
Actually she just dragged me out here! And why are you calling me Student No. EX!? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Um...actually, that girl is even more of a rare case than we are. Maybe you could leave her out...? 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ah! The gang's back together... I'm feeling invincible! I've clinched this! 
 
**Illya:**
Arrrgh, this is nuts... Although I kind of understand instinctively calling her “teacher.” 
 
**Illya:**
But...there is someone I've never met with Master. Oh, she's so pretty... 
 
**Illya:**
Anyway, I should politely introduce myself to people when I meet them for the first time. Hello, big sister! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...Yes, hello, Illyasviel. My name is Pārvatī. 
 
**Illya:**
Huh? Did I say my name already? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
The world and distant space sometimes align by sheer coincidence, like the light hitting a kaleidoscope to form a distinct and dazzling pattern... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Our encounter must be like that kind of miracle. Either way, I'm glad to see that you are well and happy, Illyasviel. 
 
**Illya:**
O-okay... Thanks...? 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hey! Trying to chat up my student is furbidden! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I've heard enough, meow! This Jaguar is here to object to what you were talking about! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Um...what WERE we talking about? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
About Masters and their Servants...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
About a contract...

---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Right! That's it! I ask of you...! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ahhh, I've always wanted to say that line. It feels nice. I KNEW I was the real heroine! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Anyway! I ask of you! Are you pawsitive you want to come to Chaldea!? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Ah, that was what we were talking about. And yes, if I have the chance... 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Listen, Chaldea is no ordinary place! Get this: Chaldea... 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Has Emiya...and Emiya...and even another Emiya! On top of that, there's even a pawsibility that more Emiyas will pop up one day! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Sukhavati!!! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I dunno, not sure there'll be more...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's not lying...

---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh heh... So whaddaya think? Confused? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...Yes. Very...confused! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I like your honesty! Now, do you really think the psyche of a serious kouhai-type would be able to withstand the ridiculous hell that is Chaldea!? 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Testing that resolve in a furrocious fight is the duty of an educator! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Let's go, Student No. EX! Now is the time to show our senpai pawers, strengthened by having to endure that weird hell for so long! 
 
**Illya:**
What!? So I'm on this side!? I don't want be on your side! I don't want to fight against Master! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
You idiot! If you do a good job here, your dream of appearing in bloomers won't have to remain a dream! 
 
**Illya:**
I don't want that either! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Are you kitten me? Fine, then how about I help you do your homework for a week? 
 
**Illya:**
... 
 
**Mash:**
She stopped moving. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Trying to make an innocent girl do your work by bribing her makes you a terrible teacher! You must be punished! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Gaaah! How could this happen!? We're both Lancers! So this is what happens when you get a fourth star! 
 
**Illya:**
Buh. I guess that means I have to do my homework on my own... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Game, set, and match. 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Urgh, so this is your resolve, huh? You've got true grit. 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But let me ask you again, and this time I want your final answer! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Cute girl who'd be cuter with some sakura petals decorating her: Do you really think you'd be happy if you came to Chaldea? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...Yes, I think so. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
To be happy, to make someone else happy...or even to be happy BY making someone else happy... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I'm sure there are many different methods. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But no matter what, as long as I am myself, I know the people around me will be happy! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Isn't that what being a goddess is about? 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Got it. If you have that much confidence in yourself, I have nothing more to say! 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But...but! It's just too purrfect! It just doesn't feel right. Don't you need SOME kinda dark side to you!? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
(Glare) 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Ah-hem. Rest assured. I may have cut away the shadowy parts of myself, but make no mistake, there is such a thing as shadows in the light. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Fujimaru and the others are well aware that I am not JUST the pure, good parts of myself. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
That's why I am able to somewhat participate in battle. Like smacking people. 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm? Hmmm...well, that's not exactly what I meant... 
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh, crap. I'm almost out of energy. Farewell, everyone! Look forward to the next exciting installment of the Jaguar Warrior show! 
 
**Illya:**
She just does whatever she wants, doesn't she? Hmm... She looks an awful lot like someone I know. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Try not to think too hard and just go home.
 
**Illya:**
Okay! I'll do that! 
 
**Illya:**
If something like this happens again, I'm sending Chloe instead. They both act like cats anyway, so they'll probably get along. Yep! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll check your homework later.
 
**Illya:**
Really, Fujimaru!? 
 
**Illya:**
Yay! I'll wait with tea and snacks at the ready! 
 
**Mash:**
You really are kind, Senpai. If I didn't have work to do, I would have loved to join. 
 
**Mash:**
While I do not have homework, I always feel that studying the books in the library is important. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure I would make great progress in my studies if I asked Senpai lots of questions, and I'm sure it would be fun. 
 

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Whew. Thanks to that mysterious jolly animal, we took an unexpected detour... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But I have a feeling we're getting close to what I'm seeking! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
We just have a little more to go. Please bear with me, Fujimaru! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Pārvatī:**
There it is! I'm sure that's it! 
 
**Mash:**
Someone's standing over there... 
 
**Medusa:**
You've finally come. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She looks familiar...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nobody would ever forget that figure!

---
 
**Medusa:**
M-Master!? Why are you here!? 
 
**Medusa:**
This is...well, this was not part of the plan. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
What are you doing? Those are MY clothes. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, you found it? You were looking for that school uniform? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Yes. It's sort of...an object that acts as an anchor to maintain my existence. That Spiritron Dress should naturally be in my possession. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But for some reason, the moment I manifested, I realized I didn't have it, and that it was somewhere else entirely. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
So I went looking for it by following its scent. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And when you sense that someone else is wearing your precious clothes... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You would never want to give them up, and go on a journey to find them, no matter what. Do you understand that feeling? 
 
**Mash:**
Um...well... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
So...what is your intention? 
 
**Medusa:**
Well...you see... 
 
**Medusa:**
It is difficult to explain my actions...even for me. 
 
**Medusa:**
After all, what I've done here was motivated by a sort of impulse that bubbled up from somewhere within me. But...at least half of my goal is accomplished now. 
 
**Mash:**
...? 
 
**Medusa:**
I used this school uniform as bait to lure you here, Pārvatī. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I see. So it was part of your plan to be found. So what is the other half of your goal? 
 
**Medusa:**
Why, to eliminate you, of course. 
 
**Mash:**
!? 
 
**Medusa:**
While some may argue otherwise, I would say that I am doing what I am because we are both goddesses. I'm not certain myself, but my gut tells me... 
 
**Medusa:**
...there's no need for you to fight if it means you have to use THAT vessel. 
 
**Medusa:**
And since you've just became a Servant, hitting you with a sufficiently powerful Spiritual attack may cleave you apart from your vessel. 
 
**Medusa:**
Doing so may entirely negate your existence as a Pseudo-Servant. 
 
**Medusa:**
So there's no reason for me not to try it. My Spirit Core is compelling me to try... 
 
**Medusa:**
Now, please... 
 
**Medusa:**
Please return to the realm of the gods. I have nothing against you personally, but brace yourself! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It looks like we can't talk this out. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I may not understand your reasoning, but I can see that you are resolved to do this. But... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I also have a purpose for being here, so I cannot allow myself to be sent away so easily. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
So, I will defend myself! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Pārvatī:**
This is the end. Please accept defeat. 
 
**Medusa:**
Ungh... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You don't look like you're willing to give up... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...(Sigh) 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I suppose I have no choice... Please, allow me to speak to you, though I must make some assumptions to do so... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I am an Indian goddess, while you are from the Greek pantheon. Bluntly put, we have nothing in common. 
 
**Medusa:**
That is...true... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Yet that doesn't seem to matter to you, and you are fighting fiercely to stop me. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It is hard to believe you're doing this just because we are both goddesses. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Then, the answer is quite clear. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You are concerned not about the goddess I am, but the girl whose body I inhabit. 
 
**Medusa:**
...Nnngh... 
 
**Medusa:**
That...is a valid point... I simply felt that you should not be fighting... 
 
**Medusa:**
... 
 
**Medusa:**
Yes, you may be right. The girl and I do have some sort of connection. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
The reason why you feel I should not fight is because you are concerned for her becoming a container for a Divine Spirit. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...Hee. Being overprotective can sometimes backfire, Rider. 
 
**Medusa:**
!!! 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, but don't get me wrong. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I'm not quite sure why, but something within me compelled me to refer to you that way, by the name of your Class. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But I have absolutely no memory of you. After all, I am Pārvatī right now. However... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Neither I, nor this body of mine, feel any anger towards you for what you've done here. In truth, we are happy about it. 
 
**Medusa:**
So...you don't intend to stop the manifestation? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
No. This is a part of my duty. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I have been entrusted with a mission. I must deal with my own mess. Well, it's my own fault for making a certain sacrifice... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
No matter the path I take, I'm certain it will lead me to save the world as a goddess. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Even if it means I must sacrifice my life, I will protect the world and the people that I love. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
And the girl shared my wish to be such a being. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It is the wish we share that allowed me to manifest here. At least that's what I believe. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Surely you must know that the girl possesses a strong heart. 
 
**Medusa:**
Yes...you're right. 
 
**Medusa:**
If your existence here is a result of her resolve... 
 
**Medusa:**
All I did was get in her way and overstepped my boundaries in doing so. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You didn't overstep anything. As I said, the thought behind your actions made us happy. Truly. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
But...there are things that even we cannot give up. That is all I wanted to say. 
 
**Medusa:**
...Ah, you are absolutely right. 
 
**Medusa:**
She may look weak and cowardly...but she really was strong-willed. 
 
**Medusa:**
I had forgotten that you were that kind of person. 
 
**Medusa:**
Please, allow me to apologize for my actions. And these clothes... Here, I will return them to their rightful owner. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Thank you very much. This is a relief. 
 
**Mash:**
Looks like everything has been settled peacefully, Senpai. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep, yep... Whoa, Par!?

---
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, my... I'm a bit drained now that everything is over. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Now that I've recovered what I sought, this seems like a good place to take a rest. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Please rest assured. Now that we have met once and forged a bond... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
...so long as we retain that connection, we are sure to meet again, Fujimaru. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Yes. In due time, I am sure I will become your Servant. When that happens, I will work my hardest, so please take good care of me. 
 
**Medusa:**
... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It's okay, Rider. My shyness will never completely go away, but I've gotten tougher. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Even if the relationships between those in Chaldea are as complicated as that odd animal said... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
I'll be...well...I'm sure I'll be...fine. 
 
**Medusa:**
... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Is something else bothering you? Oh, I get it. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
You've come to like this school uniform too, haven't you, Rider? 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, all right. Even though this was originally mine... 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Those who have only seen you wearing this uniform might think a goddess assaulted you and stole your clothes. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
It might be best to consider making a duplicate of the uniform just for you. 
 
**Pārvatī:**
Oh, it would be so wonderful for the two of us to wear matching uniforms and become Servants together! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...

---
 
**Medusa:**
I'm sorry, Master. This has turned into something of an anticlimactic farewell. 
 
**Medusa:**
But that is another side of the girl...or so I feel. She can be a little ditzy... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No worries. I have a feeling we'll meet again.

---
 
**Medusa:**
... 
 
**Medusa:**
Master. I know that, with you, there's no need to bring this up, but I will say it just the same. 
 
**Mash:**
(Senpai, Senpai... Medusa's giving you a really terrifying glare, and she's not even using her Mystic Eyes!) 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-yes?

---
 
**Medusa:**
Even if you do manage to summon her... 
 
**Medusa:**
You must vow to not treat her like a disposable pawn or put her in unnecessarily dangerous situations. 
 
**Medusa:**
I'm not asking for you to give her special treatment. 
 
**Medusa:**
I'm only saying that you should treat her as well as the rest of your Servants, and take good care of her. Understood? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood.

---
 
**Medusa:**
I can't hear you. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
YES, MA'AM!!!

---
 
**Medusa:**
Good {(M) boy/(F) girl}. Now, let us head back. 
 
**Medusa:**
Hm. I wonder why I'm feeling so restless. 
 
**Medusa:**
Perhaps I should prepare by cleaning the room next to mine. 
 
**Mash:**
Par is somewhat special, even unique among Pseudo-Servants... 
 
**Mash:**
And not just to Medusa... 
 
**Mash:**
But perhaps many others in Chaldea would feel the same way when they see her. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's concerning.
 
**Mash:**
It'll be okay. As long as Master's around, any complicated relationships between the Servants are sure to be resolved quickly! 
 
**Mash:**
And of course, I will do my very best to support you! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's something to look forward to.
 
**Mash:**
That's the spirit, Master! I hope to one day have an outlook as positive as yours! 
 

---
 
**Mash:**
Either way, our quest here is done now. Good work!
