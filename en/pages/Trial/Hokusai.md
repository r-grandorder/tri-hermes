# Trial Quest - Katsushika Hokusai

## Introduction of the New Year's Day Dream
 
**???:**
Become a dead soul/I'll head to the summer field/For my own delight. 
 
**???:**
Ah...I wanna be better... 
 
**???:**
...I wanna get better... 
 
**???:**
I wanna paint...something that's right... The real deal... 
 
**???:**
...What's that now? Am I hearin' things? 
 
**???:**
...Somethin' is calling me... 
 
**???:**
A voice from deep below...is calling... 
 
**???:**
What in tarnation...keeps barkin' out my name...? 
 
**???:**
Quiet, you... There's no need to be shoutin' like that. Even a dead child would wake with that kind of ruckus. 
 
**B：???:**
...Wait... 
 
**B：???:**
Stop right there. You mustn't go further into the Abyss... 
 
**???:**
Who the heck are ya? 
 
**???:**
I was just gettin' cozy, sinkin' down into the depths like this... 
 
**???:**
Oh hey, you're the voice I've been hearin'. 
 
**???:**
That is no good...So you're hearing it already... 
 
**???:**
You mustn't heed that voice. 
 
**???:**
That is...the voice of the devil who lives in the Abyss. 
 
**???:**
Oh? Well, that's a hoot. 
 
**???:**
I've always wanted to meet a real devil. 
 
**???:**
No...go...back... 
 
**???:**
Heh. The hell I care. 
 
**???:**
...Ph'nglui...ph'nglui...ph'nglui... 
 
**D：Voice of a Peddler:**
Natto beans! Natto beans! Beans with miso! 
 
**E：Voice of a Peddler:**
Littleneck clams! Freshwater clams! Littlenecks, freshwater...both are clams! 
 
**D：Voice of a Peddler:**
Mo...mo...mo...mochi! Get your mochi! 
 
**E：Voice of a Peddler:**
Get your fans here! Folding fans are a must to celebrate the New Year! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---
 
**D：Voice of a Peddler:**
Amazake! Get your sweet and tasty amazake! Great for ringin' in the New Year! 
 
**C：???:**
Right here! I'll take a cup! 
 
**D：Voice of a Peddler:**
Hey there, thanks for your purchase! And a Happy New Year, missy! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can hear the hustle and bustle of a city...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Amazake...New Year's... Which means...

---
 
**C：???:**
Oh. You're awake? Master...Master!? 
 
**C：???:**
If you sleep in the middle of the street, you'll like, literally get hit by a cart and die, you know? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Suzuka...Gozen...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My first dream of the year's amazing, as usual!

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Sup, Master☆ Like, Happy New Year. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Here you go. A hot cup of amazake. It tastes pretty good, and you know, it'll totes warm you up. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Happy New Year...to you, too.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
HNY! We're gonna slay this year! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Now that the New Year's greeting's done, it's time for the year's first selfie☆ 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um...where are we...?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Don't you get it? We're on, like, a big crowded street. 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
We're at the foot of the Ryougoku Bridge in Tokyo...no, Edo. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
The shore over there is Musashi Province, where Edo Castle stands. This side is Shimousa. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That's why it's called “Ryougoku” Bridge, meaning “Two Provinces.” It connects the two. Even I know that. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Apparently it's, like, January 1 today... So I thought it'd be all calm and peaceful, y'know? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But OMG! It was among the busiest places in the world at the time...a literal million people living there! Known as the city of eight-hundred-and-eight towns! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
There are playhouses, sit-down teahouses, food carts and peddlers, and even freak shows! So Master and I don't stick out. Sick, huh? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But aren't we totally in the Edo period? I can't even. Master, did you like, just time travel? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Edo period!?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Did you think you were dreaming? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This isn't my first dream of the year!?
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hmmm? A first dream? Maybe? I guess that's possible... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But no matter how you look at it, you can't change what's happening IRL. Think about what you're gonna do, not what has already happened. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So, tell me...how much do you remember before you lost consciousness, Master? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, let's see...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If I think back...

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Uh-huh. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So there was a NYE party at Chaldea? Oh yeah, there was. LIT. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And you ate New Year's udon with Musashi? And you got New Year's mochi and pickles from Hijikata? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And you ate sweet red bean soup with Chacha? And you gave a New Year's gift to Baraki and ate sweets? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh, come on! You ate your way through New Year's! Rather than doing traditional stuff like visiting a shrine, you're just in it for the fun? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Hm? You, Okki, and Archerferno played board games together? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What!? Well, thanks for the invite! No fair! Bah...and what else? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Nobbu crashed your game and forced you to drink some super sketch drink from a foreign country...? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That's it! Bingo! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I drank that too! Maybe that's why I'm here with you!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
A golden, honey flavored drink!!! I say that's the cause of this whole mess! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
My senses are totally telling me that! It may have been honey flavored, but it was TOO sparkly! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I was told it would bring good luck for the New Year, so I had a sip...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't remember anything after I took a drink...

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
OMG... I also let my guard down from all the hype... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So let's rewind. Our current galaxy brain for this place is... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
A Reality Marble, virtual reality on a Spiritron level, a parallel world that went off the rails from the timeline...or, to go totally cray cray...a collab dream? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you really think this is reality?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I'm getting that you really want this to be your first dream of the year or something. Guess I can let you have that much. Not like I've got another explanation. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I had a “dream” like this last New Year's.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Are you talking about Musashi? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I heard the deets, and I think it was more like you were in a different world that made you THINK it was a dream. But whatevs. 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Anyway, let's assume that we're in some kind of dream. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Servants don't usually dream, so I'm, like, ninety percent sure that this is totes all you... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hmmm, in which case, that's lit AF! I mean, it's so realistic and stuff! You keeping your genius on the DL? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Even though I only know the basics of the Edo period, I knew right off that we were totally in Edo! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Actually, it feels more realistic than the real thing. Like some god is lurking in the shadows or something! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And if this is all a dream, there's nothing to worry about, and by the time that shady drink wears off, we'll be back in Chaldea, right? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So if that's the case, I wouldn't mind hooking up for a mini-New Year's date with you, Master. Teehee. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A date's not such a bad idea.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Right!? Nothing beats going out! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you really think we can get back to Chaldea?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
We'll be fine! After all, you got me here with you, right? 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Whoa! Watch out, Master! No getting stomped on my watch! 
 
**D：Townsperson:**
Okay, outta my way! 
 
**D：Townsperson:**
Only crazy people would be stupid enough to be standing in the middle of this traffic! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What!? YOU'RE the one who's insane for bolting over the bridge so fast! SUPER dangerous, guy. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And where's the fire? Shouldn't you be taking it easy 'cuz it's New Year's!? 
 
**D：Townsperson:**
I'm in a hurry BECAUSE it's New Year's. It's almost time for the kakizome, the first calligraphy writing of the year, at the Ekou-in! 
 
**D：Townsperson:**
THE Katsushika Hokusai is gonna be doing the honors...and I get to watch it with my own eyes! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Katsushika...Hokusai!? I swear I've heard that name before... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Do you know the name, Master? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Katsushika Hokusai...totes famous.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
For real!? Then we should go check it out too! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Edo's most famous ukiyo-e painter.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ooh, a celebrity! Did you secretly wanna go to art school or something? Not many people wanna dream about someone like that, you know? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So I think the whatsit temple that guy mentioned is near by. Wanna go check it out? 
 

---
 
**:**
 
　　　【Main Street Ryougoku, Ekou-in Grounds】 
 
**???:**
... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A young girl with a giant brush...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's writing something on the ground...

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Wow, what's going on? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Okay, that brush is STUPIDLY big! And that paper she's writing on could cover the whole temple! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That young girl is the painter? Is SHE Hokusai!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Weird...I thought Hokusai was a man...
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Uh, considering the people you got on speed dial, that means literally nothing, you know... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Still, the townspeople seem a little confused too. Maybe it isn't actually Hokusai after all? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Same deal as with Musashi, then?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey Master! I thought we came to see a painting!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If your mood right now is a high school girl who looks killer in a kimono, then, uh, I'm right here. 
 

---
 
**Townspeople A:**
Wow. I hear the calligraphy paper's the size of one hundred and twenty tatami mats. 
 
**Townspeople A:**
The disciples are all hovering around her, ready to blow water over the paper and wipe away ink... 
 
**Townspeople A:**
Still, that's not Master Hokusai, right? Who the heck is she? 
 
**Townspeople B:**
What, you don't know? That's Hokusai's daughter. 
 
**Townspeople B:**
I hear she's quite the artist herself. Can't remember her pseudonym, though... 
 
**Townspeople A:**
Heh. Don't act like a know-it-all. You don't know any more than I do. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not...the real Katsushika Hokusai?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's his daughter...?

---
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Ooooh-kay! Done and done! 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Hang the paper up! Higher! Higher! Up like a kite! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hm? Oh, we can finally get the whole pic and see what's she painting this whole time! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ah... It's Hotei-son! A manifestation of the Maitreya Buddha! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Huh. Not bad. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A picture of Hotei? Oh, I see it now...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I couldn't tell while she was painting it.

---
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Everyone, take a nice, long gander! A picture of Hotei-son, the great monk Qì Cǐ from Karakuni. 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
I had the honor of offering my drawing to the gods using the first water, the first ink, and first brush of the year on this auspicious New Year's Day! 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
As you should all know, I've drawn one of the Seven Lucky Gods! Just one peek at it will grant you good luck in the coming year! 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
With this incredible start-of-the-year painting that requires one to step back ten paces just to see... 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
...I hereby offer a small New Year's greeting from the Katsushika Hokusai school of art. 
 
**F：Publisher:**
Everyone who's come to see this spectacle...take a look at these goods, too! 
 
**F：Publisher:**
Fresh off from the printing press! Master Hokusai's latest ukiyo-e! 
 
**F：Publisher:**
And for the kiddos, a painted board game where they can take a tour around Enoshima! 
 
**F：Publisher:**
We even have Treasure Ship ukiyo-e that you put under your pillow! A necessity for your New Year's dream! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Maybe this really is my New Year's dream...)

---
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Whew...all done for now... 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
...Oh?  Oh? Oh, oh, oh? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
She's totally staring. And she's coming closer. 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
You... 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
You! You're quite the beauty! 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Are you an actor? Or are you one of those traveling courtesans? 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
You don't see a beauty like this every day...even among Yoshiwara's hostesses! A great omen! A sight for sore eyes...right at the beginning of the New Year! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...!? Huh!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Th-that...isn't...completely fake news... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Hm? A hostess? Traveling courtesan? Aren't those... 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Ahh...if I wasn't so swamped, I'd totally ask you to model for me. 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
By the way... 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
That [♂ sodden-looking boy /♀ stylish-looking girl] next to you is in a weird-looking getup. Is that some sort of European outfit? 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Or is [♂ he /♀ she] just pretending to be [♂ an old sage /♀ a pretty fairy] or something? Year's just started! Kinda early for that sort of weirdness, isn't it? 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Oh, pardon me. Don't take my words too personally. Just a bit of festive teasing. 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
There's always a buncha weird guys walkin' around here, it being the freak show neighborhood and all. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you Katsushika Hokusai, the ukiyo-e painter?
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Ahaha! Nope, nope. I'm just a measly assistant. 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
Katsushika Hokusai is my Toto-sama. Ya know, my father. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(What's that creature floating next to her...?)
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
What's wrong? What you starin' at? 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
You lookin' for Hokusai? Sorry, but he's not here. 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If you're not the legit Hokusai, why were you the one painting with the big brush? 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
...Hmmm...well...it's a long story. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
My name is Suzuka. This is Fujimaru. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
We're on like...a cross country pilgrimage kinda thing right now. 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
I...uh... 
 
**A：Hokusai's Daughter:**
I'm...Ei. I'm but a humble painter. 
 
**F：Hokusai's Disciple:**
Master Oei! Come here, quick! 
 
**Oei:**
...The other disciples and townsfolk here call me “Oei.” 
 
**Oei:**
What's going on? Something the matter? 
 
**B：Town Policeman:**
Katsushika Hokusai! Is Katsushika Hokusai the painter around!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They look like they could be the police...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I'll just say that this is all in my imagination...)

---
 
**Townspeople A:**
Oh, crap. It's the town's police from the magistrate's office from the south! It's Hatchoubori! 
 
**Townspeople B:**
What is this? Are we seriously seeing a police raid on New Year's? 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
We received intel that there is a miscreant who's been falsely claiming to be the famous painter, Hokusai, here at the Ekou-in! 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
Katsushika Hokusai! Is Katsushika Hokusai around!? If the real Katsushika Hokusai is not here... 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
...then we're taking the imposter into custody immediately! 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
You're under arrest! 
 
**Officer “Sei”:**
Under...arrest... 
 
**Oei:**
...Ungh... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's finally looking like a dream.

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
This is, like, hella chaotic. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But Oei and the others didn't do anything bad. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hokusai himself coming out and explaining himself would be the real move, but... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Where's Katsushika Hokusai?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I really want to know what that creature is...)

---
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Please wait! I am Nishimuraya, an ukiyo-e publisher. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
I was the one who organized this giant calligraphy event. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Just as you mentioned, that Hotei-son painting was not produced by the great Hokusai himself. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
It was done by a group of Hokusai's disciples. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
But the ukiyo-e that I sell really are the works of the great Hokusai. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Such arrangements were already explained to Ekou-in personnel, and should have been passed on to you! 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Should there be any problems, I will personally take responsibility...! 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
Hm? That's not even close to what our report said. Hey, what's going on? 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
(Whisper) Look, we've already been paid for our services... 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
Let's just arrest them all and make them fess up at the magistrate's office later. 
 
**Officer “Sei”:**
Under...arrest... 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
Hmmm...if we can't get the stories straight here, there's nothing we can do about it, is there? 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
It seems like we'll have to head over to “Hoeidou”... 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Huh? What did you just say? Did you say “Hoeidou”? 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Isn't that the name of the publisher of the Utagawa school? 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
Quit your complaining! You're under arrest! 
 
**Oei:**
Aiya! Wait, Nishimuraya! 
 
**Oei:**
There's no way I'm letting you get arrested, since you've done so much for me. 
 
**Oei:**
Besides, there's no need to bend over backwards so much, just because it's the police! 
 
**Oei:**
Hey, hey! When did Edo's town police get so violent!? 
 
**Oei:**
I came here to entertain all the folks who came for the New Year's festivities! Didn't charge anyone a single coin, you know! 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
What a spirited young lady. Hokusai sure has quite the disciple. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
O-Oei...please calm down. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oei's charging in...!

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Aw, crap... What should we do, Master? This is getting kinda outta hand... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I mean, that Oei girl... She said I was pretty and everything... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I can't just, like, left swipe this whole situation. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I agree. Please resolve this peacefully.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
YEET!!! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Got it! Peaceful, right!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Those police who came to make arrests don't seem to be all bad either, TBH... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go out with a bang, since it's a dream anyway.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
You sure you're good with that? This dream dictates your luck for the rest of the year, you know? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Though really, I like it when things get flashy! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
All right then, Master. Count on me! 
 

---
 
**Oei:**
Um, misters and misses of the police... 
 
**Oei:**
You weren't going to accuse us of some crime we didn't commit to collect hush money, were you!? 
 
**Oei:**
Sorry, but I'm not gonna pay for something like that! 
 
**Oei:**
What's wrong with having a painter paint what they want!? I've got nothing to be ashamed of! 
 
**Oei:**
If you still insist on arresting people, you'll have to start with me! 
 
**Oei:**
...But know I got this giant brush, and like any ukiyo-e painter worth their salt, I'm not afraid to use it! 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
...Hm. I have no issue being a fool and a lazy bum... 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
But if you say it out loud like that in public, you're making our jobs difficult. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
Ah, and the way you're mocking us! I can't just let that slide! 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
You're going to die...and all for our secret money stash! Don't underestimate the accounting department of the magistrate's office! 
 
**Officer “Sei”:**
You're under arrest♪ 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei! We're going to lend you a hand! Master and I are TOTES ready after all that hype! 
 
**Oei:**
Oh? That sword of yours isn't a theater prop? It's real!? 
 
**Oei:**
What a surprise. A female samurai... You're straight out of a novel! I like you even more now! 
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Oei:**
Whew...what a surprise...but I don't know what happened here... 
 
**Oei:**
I charged in without thinking, but what the heck happened? My body feels really light. 
 
**Oei:**
I can run as fast as a bolt of lightning and swing my brush like a tornado. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
Okay, that was impressive. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
You wield a brush so wonderfully. It is a shame that you remain but a painter. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
Hm... Whether you are the real Hokusai or not, you certainly have the skills of a true artist. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
We were at fault here, I admit it. We framed you for a crime you didn't commit, and I apologize for that. 
 
**Oei:**
O-okay... It's fine, as long as you understand. 
 
**Oei:**
I got a little carried away, too. A-are you hurt? 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
Heh. When did you get so soft, Hatchoubori? 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
Whatever their reasons, they interfered with the duties of agents of the shogunate! They are definitely not getting off the hook here! 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
That's not true. Take a good look...we are within the grounds of the Ekou-in. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
And that means that this was all merely a round of sumo held in offering to the gods, though I'll grant you it was a lively round. 
 
**Officer “Bou”:**
Sumo...? You really are a softie. Well, if you want to call this a minor offense, so be it. 
 
**Detective “Hatchoubori”:**
We shall take our leave. My apologies, Nishimuraya. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
Please think nothing of it! 
 
**Oei:**
Oh? A dream? This whole city? 
 
**Oei:**
Ahaha! That's so ridiculous, Fujimaru! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm actually serious...
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Literally! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you have anything to say, Suzuka?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Well, you know...you SAY it's a dream, but battle totes hurts. And...if I do this...it tickles, doesn't it? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Well, if you think about it, this is probably more than your everyday dream, Master. It's probably, like, some kinda vision or something. 
 

---
 
**Oei:**
Haha! No, sorry for laughing. To tell you the truth... 
 
**Oei:**
I've always loved wild stories like that, even if people look at me like I'm crazy when I say so. 
 
**Oei:**
So thinking that this world is actually someone's dream...why not? 
 
**Oei:**
Take “The Butterfly Dream” or “The World Inside a Pillow,” for example. Both stories from Karakuni. 
 
**Oei:**
I'm not sure if you're the one in our dream, or if we're the ones in your dream... 
 
**Oei:**
...But that's probably not really important right now. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Are we dancing...or are we being made to dance...? OMG, Oei, you're sooo funny! 
 
**Oei:**
Hehe! Sorry to drag you into all this trouble. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
I would also like to thank you. 
 
**Oei:**
Nishimuraya, I won't let you get forced out of business like Tsutajuu. 
 
**Oei:**
But...where in the world has my Toto-sama gone wanderin' off to? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is there a problem?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Come on, why don't you tell Master? 
 
**Oei:**
...Yeah... Maybe I can confide in you. 
 
**Publisher “Nishimuraya”:**
So actually...and please keep this confidential... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Missing? Since yesterday? So you have no clue where this Katsushika Hokusai guy is? 
 
**Oei:**
...Yeah, I've got nothin'. 
 
**Oei:**
I've been searchin' for him with help from the other disciples, but he's not at the bars in back of Asakusa Shrine or in Yoshiwara, and we didn't find him on the pleasure boats either. 
 
**Oei:**
Toto-sama is real flighty, but he's never just up and left without telling anyone. 
 
**Oei:**
If he tripped and fell into the Sumida River, it'll be a few more days before he floats up. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh great, now I've got an image of a drowned body stuck in my head! Don't say that kinda stuff! Bad luck and such! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Speaking of floating...what is that creature next to you...?

---
 
**Oei:**
This? Well...this is... 
 
**Oei:**
It's...an octopus, duh. 
 
**Oei:**
It ain't unusual for things to be floatin' during New Year's. I guess it'd usually be a kite though, yeah... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-you think so...?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's getting all hyped up too. Totally ugly-cute. Let me squeeze it! 
 
**Oei:**
Oh, wait! Don't touch it! 
 
**Oei:**
Eek! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It spit ink!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Totally my bad. S-sorry! Let me wipe it off! 
 
**Oei:**
Ungh...don't worry about it... My face is dirty from ink already anyway. Haha... 
 
**Oei:**
This octopus is a little crabby (wipe wipe), and I've just been ignoring it because there's nothing I could do to control it (wipe wipe wipe). 
 
**G：Oei:**
Phew. So...about Toto-sama... 
 
**G：Oei:**
I know I managed to make it through the Hotei-son gig at the Ekou-in... 
 
**G：Oei:**
...but actually, the original plan was to follow up by doing a miniature painting of sparrows on a grain of rice. 
 
**G：Oei:**
Sadly, the best I can manage is maybe one bird to a grain. Toto-sama would have been able to get two or three birds on a single grain. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
One grain of rice...? That's a pretty crazy standard you're setting. 
 
**G：Oei:**
And there's also one more incredibly important job left. 
 
**G：Oei:**
We definitely need Toto-sama for this one. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An important job...?

---
 
**:**
 
　【Somewhere in Edo - Ukiyo-e Painter's Atelier】 
 
**C：???:**
It appears that the cops we sent to Ekou-in have failed. 
 
**C：???:**
Perhaps you should have been a bit more generous with your payoff? 
 
**E：???:**
I don't care if a clown who thinks she's a painter wants to make a fool of herself. 
 
**E：???:**
But since Hokusai himself didn't show his face even after all that, his disciples must not know where he is, either. 
 
**E：???:**
Where the hell did he go? 
 
**E：???:**
Either way, if Hokusai's not around...he won't be able to appear before the court tomorrow. 
 
**C：???:**
The painting performance before the court... Before the shogun, Lord Tokugawa Ienari. 
 
**C：???:**
Do you really think so, Grand Mentor? They may still send a substitute. 
 
**C：???:**
After all, he's a man who had a chicken draw a painting in his place. 
 
**E：???:**
The nerve of him. What does he think art is? Exactly the sort of nonsense I'd expect from that clown. 
 
**E：???:**
A substitute, you say... There's no harm in being cautious. Do you know who was used? 
 
**C：???:**
Out of the hundred disciples in Hokusai's school... 
 
**C：???:**
The one most likely to be chosen as a substitute is his daughter, Katsushika Oui. 
 
**C：???:**
If we're to tarnish his reputation for good, we need to be absolutely sure. 
 
**E：???:**
Indeed. Let's communicate with “Hoeidou” and plan our next steps. 
 
**E：???:**
We're going to run that imposter clown out of Edo, once and for all. You. You're going to be a part of it, too. 
 
**E：???:**
Understood, Hiroshige? 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
Yes, Grand Mentor. I, Utagawa Hiroshige, will see this through. 
 
**E：???:**
...By the way. Are you sure this was the right casting choice? 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
Haha. Probably. There still aren't many artist Servants, so there is nothing for it, really. 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
I think it's fine. Dream or no dream, I'm having fun. 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
A human's life dazzles the brightest when one dreams. 
 
## Ukiyo-e is Dreamlike
 
**:**
 
　　【Ryougoku - Katsushika Hokusai's New Home】 
 
**Oei:**
Make yourself at home. 
 
**Oei:**
I've left the other disciples with Nishimuraya to handle the ukiyo-e sales at the Enkou-in. 
 
**Oei:**
So I'm going to take a rest. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Presenting your painting in front of the shogun? So you're going to paint in front of him? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
The shogun ruling Edo, huh? So, like, the Seii-Taishogun! Is he hot!? 
 
**Oei:**
Are you talking about Lord Ienari? Not one bit. There's no such thing as a good-looking shogun. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey, sure there is! Don't say that! 
 
**Oei:**
Ahaha, sorry 'bout that. I was just kidding. Don't get so mad. 
 
**Oei:**
But it doesn't matter as long as he has work. He's as important a customer to me as the townsfolk are. 
 
**Oei:**
Toto-sama has never cared much about money, but lately he's completely indifferent. 
 
**Oei:**
So money's always tight... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
By the way, what were you going to paint for of the shogun? 
 
**Oei:**
It's supposed to be an auspicious painting fit for New Year's. We were tasked to paint a Treasure Ship for him. 
 
**Oei:**
Toto-sama may not be here, but we have no choice. I'll at least prepare the tools and references. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is so messy...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
“Make yourself at home,” she says, but there's no room...

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
OMG. All those paintings of beautiful women, so gorgeous... But they were drawn in such a gross room! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
There's a half-eaten bowl of rice just SITTING THERE on the floor! Yuck! Clean up a little! 
 
**Oei:**
What!? Cleaning!? 
 
**Oei:**
We haven't cleaned this place since we moved in! 
 
**Oei:**
And I've never cooked in my life, if I may add. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What!? Hm...? O-ouch!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I stepped on something... Oh, it's a little wooden sculpture.

---
 
**Oei:**
Ah, that's a Kukai statue. It's the blessed, great Koubou-Daishi. 
 
**Oei:**
Oh, so THAT'S where that was hiding. It's no painting tool, but thanks for finding it. 
 
**Oei:**
Toto-sama prays to it every morning and night. It represents the Myouken Bosatsu. 
 
**Oei:**
Maybe that's why Toto-sama was in a bad mood... 
 
**Oei:**
...Hm? Wait a minute. 
 
**Oei:**
I don't believe this! There's one place I haven't looked yet! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei, where're you going? 
 
**Oei:**
You guys just sit there and eat some of that bean paste mochi! I got it as a present! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Bean paste mochi? Or...uh, is that matcha&ndash;eek! OH GROSS! It's just MOLDY! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are you going?

---
 
**Oei:**
To Yanagishima's Mt. Myouken! The Hosshou Temple by the Jikken Bridge! 
 
**Oei:**
Toto-sama went up there to pray a lot in his youth. He was really struggling back then, and near to giving up. 
 
**Oei:**
I'm not sure if it's true or not, but Toto-sama said he narrowly escaped death when a lightning bolt struck right next to him. 
 
**Oei:**
And since that happened, the work has been pouring in. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see... I'll help you look for him.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Jikken Bridge is where you can get the best photos of Tokyo Skytree.

---
 
**E：???:**
Oh, there she is. Hold on a sec. 
 
**E：???:**
You... Are you by chance Katsushika Oui, the ukiyo-e painter? 
 
**D：???:**
...(Gulp) 
 
**D：???:**
(An octopus...) 
 
**Oei:**
Eh? Oh, yeah, that's right. Why do you know my name? 
 
**E：???:**
Old Meowster! We found her! 
 
**D：???:**
Come on, Old Meowster! This is no time to get seconds on dumplings! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Old Meowster...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What kind of Mito Jaguar-mon is this?

---
 
**Old Meowster:**
Hm! Good work, Miss Suke and Miss Kaku! 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Sic 'em! 
 
**D：???:**
That's too fast! Don't jump the gun! 
 
**Oei:**
You guys...are dressed real strange. My eyes sting. Are you candy craftsmen or something? 
 
**Oei:**
Maybe it isn't my business, but... It'd be one thing if you were in one of Ryougoku's freak shows... 
 
**Oei:**
Wandering around the streets of Edo in getups like that, you'll be arrested for public indecency. You won't be able to sell ever gain. 
 
**Oei:**
Hmmm... I'm a little worried... Maybe I should just paint over your outfits? 
 
**D：???:**
I'm terribly sorry! This is just our norm! And please don't paint over us... 
 
**E：???:**
Miss Suke can't help it. Her name stands for “Super Ultra Kinky Enchantress,” after all. 
 
**D：???:**
Slander!!! 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
I'm Kakuloe. That's Ilysuke. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
We're taking a leisurely trip through the country with Miss High-and-Mighty here. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
She's a retired chirimen merchant from Echigo. 
 
**Oei:**
Oh, I see. So what do you want? 
 
**Oei:**
I'm in a hurry. Can we take a rain check? 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
U-um! Have you ever seen this ukiyo-e? 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Some suspicious-looking art dealer sold this to us. He tricked us into thinking it was a bona fide Hokusai piece. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Ab-purr-lutely! 
 
**Oei:**
...So that's why you need me. I guess I have no choice. 
 
**Oei:**
...Give it to me. I'll take a look. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a scroll of a beautiful woman...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whether it's a fake or not, there's something off about all this.

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Thicc and sexy bare legs are a no-no? The Edo period sure is the worst. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Do you think I should change my style? Hmmm? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait...is this not...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Are Suzuka and I not the ones dreaming here?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master! Don't ghost me! Hey, I'm gonna strip right here! 
 
**Oei:**
...Yeah. This ukiyo-e is definitely real. 
 
**Oei:**
I know this printer's work, and the brush strokes of the signature are familiar. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
I mew it! 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Nyafufu! My appraisal was correct! 
 
**H：Old Meowster:**
Now behold this hollyhock crested toe bean! 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
Too early...still too early, Old Meowster... 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
...Um, would you please stop silently pressing your toe beans all over my face? 
 
**H：Old Meowster:**
BEHOLD IT!!! 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
Ugh, I asked you to stop! This is not how you show someone someth&ndash; 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
Mngf! Ouch! Stop trying to shove your toe beans into my eyes! Old Meowster!? Miss Old Meowster!? 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Old Meowster's feral instincts are going berserk again... 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Well, I'm going to let Ilysuke handle that thing... Now then, Katsushika Oui... 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
...our Old Meowster is insinuating that this ukiyo-e was actually drawn by you. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
It may be hard to believe, but she's actually got quite a good eye. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
That's why she bought it&ndash;because she took a liking to it. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
But she couldn't believe that the signature said “Hokusai.” 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
To be just like a certain someone...and yet, not acknowledged as a different person from that someone... 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
She says the painting reflects outrage at that contradiction. 
 
**Oei:**
... 
 
**Oei:**
I don't care... 
 
**Oei:**
And what do you care? 
 
**Oei:**
You don't know a thing about ukiyo-e. 
 
**Oei:**
The customers all are happy they're buying Katsushika Hokusai paintings. Nobody's getting hurt. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
You don't think so? 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
I don't know a thing about ukiyo-e... 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
...but I can sniff out lies a mile away. Especially lies that people tell to themselves. 
 
**Oei:**
...Ungh. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Oei? Hey, Oei. What's going on? You triggered? 
 
**Oei:**
What's it matter if it's plain, or a lie? 
 
**Oei:**
No matter what people say, this is my way of living! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
A p-purge!? That's...! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A strong magical energy response! Oei's a Servant!?
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master, you feel it too!? Does that mean Oei's... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
This dream realm is...hers...? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
S-she stripped! Nice tracts of la
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
THAT'S what you're focusing on!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
You know what, I curse you! I hope you get a New Year's dumpling stuck in your throat and sent to THAT nurse's armory&ndash;I mean, infirmary! 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If Oei's an unknown Servant... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...I can't just sit by and tell myself this is a dream. 
 
**G：Suzuka Gozen:**
I'm going to up my INT too! Okay, Master!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you, Suzuka!
 
**G：Suzuka Gozen:**
Got it! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That style is pretty lit too, Suzuka!
 
**G：Suzuka Gozen:**
U-uh, Master... Okay! Now you're speaking my language! 
 

---
 
**G：Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei, I'm going to back you up for now, but you'll have a lot of explaining to do later! 
 
**F：Oei:**
...Suzuka. 
 
**F：Oei:**
You're such a busybody. The only person who can boss me around is Toto-sama! 
 
**E：Miss Kakuloe:**
...Oh. Sorry. Did I hit a nerve? 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
Please don't deliberately antagonize people! Though I don't think that's the only reason why she's mad... 
 
**H：Old Meowster:**
Heh. Miss Suke. Miss Kaku. 
 
**H：Old Meowster:**
It's time for the Black Panther of Edo&ndash;I mean, the Mito Kou-meow Jaguar to show her true stripes! 
 
**E：Miss Kakuloe:**
Yes! 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
Understood! 
 
**E：Miss Kakuloe:**
Do you not see these toe beans!? 
 
**E：Miss Kakuloe:**
Who do you think this person in front of you is? 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
Tremble before the former vice shogun... Um...the vice shogun from about...two hundred years ago! 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
It is Lord Mito Mitsukuni! 
 
**D：Miss Illysuke:**
You stand before a great elder lord! Bow your head! Know your place! 
 
**E：Miss Kakuloe:**
And I'll thank you to keep any clever remarks to yourselves! 
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**F：Oei:**
...I feel sick...I need to sit down... 
 
**Old Meowster:**
That's enough! 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
...! 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Looks like your Mana Burst settled down. We somehow managed to hold her back... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Suzuka Gozen! Tend to Oei!

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
On it! 
 
**F：Oei:**
What...was that...? 
 
**F：Oei:**
That was even more power than back at the Ekou-in... It felt like...I turned into Toto-sama, or something... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Simmer down! Oh, and I need to straighten your clothes... 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
U-um, if I'm not overstepping my boundaries, I would like to help! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
OMG, thanks! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Are you okay, Oei?

---
 
**Oei:**
Yeah. I am now. 
 
**Oei:**
That beautiful piece...was a collaboration between me and Toto-sama. 
 
**Oei:**
I believe it was the first time I was tasked with rendering the main subject. 
 
**Oei:**
I painted the woman, and Toto-sama painted the background flowers, like the crape myrtle. 
 
**Oei:**
Since then, I've painted many works under Toto-sama's name... 
 
**Old Meowster:**
I see. So that's the reason for the disjointed feeling. 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
D-does that mean...some sections of the paintings are fa&ndash;I mean, counterfeit...? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...That's not the right way to think of it. Ukiyo-e paintings are mostly made as collabs by multiple people in the first place. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
First, you have the painter who designs and renders the original image. Then there's the carver who cuts the wooden blocks faithfully to the original design. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Then there's the printer, who precisely transfers multiple layers of color to paper. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And then there's the publisher, who suggests and manages each project, advertises new prints to customers, and handles distribution. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Put them all together, and you've got yourself a team! It's totally different than Western painters! 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Oh, really? So the pen name “Katsushika Hokusai” isn't just a single painter's name... 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
...but something like a brand name, really? 
 
**Oei:**
...You sure do know a lot, Suzuka. You sound and look godly, even. 
 
**Oei:**
But...yeah, you're absolutely right. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
I get it now. It's all purr-fectly clear now. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
If that's the case, I have only one request! Katsushika Oui...will you give me a paw-tograph? 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Write it to “Adrian”! Wait, no, “Alien”? No, that's still not right... 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Um...anyway! Would you mind adding your cool-sounding pen name to the painting? 
 
**Old Meowster:**
I have at least the right to ask for that! 
 
**Oei:**
B-but... MY name...? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The customer always gets what they want, right?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(The octopus has been nodding its head the whole time...)

---
 
**Oei:**
B-but... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Why don't you just write it, Oei? 
 
**Oei:**
Stop... Really... It's...embarrassing... 
 
**Oei:**
Fine. I'm only doing this because I want to make up for my blunder from earlier. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Okay, Miss Kaku! Ink! Get the ink and brush ready! 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Sure, sure. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
By the way, about that suspicious art dealer selling ukiyo-e...?

---
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
Um, there were two of them...and they never introduced themselves. 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
I did some secret snooping, and I found that they were carrying things labeled “Seieidou” and “Kitsurudou.” 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
“Seieidou” and “Kitsurudou”? 
 
**Oei:**
What the...? They're both publishers that handle works from the Utagawa school. 
 
**Oei:**
But that's strange. I don't think we sell our work to either of them... 
 
**Oei:**
And as for this print here, I remember I personally asked the printer to produce a smaller quantity. 
 
**Oei:**
I got so heated up on this piece, and the picture turned out to be so intricate, the printing blocks broke easily. 
 
**Oei:**
It's a failed piece. You could say I got a little carried away. 
 
**Oei:**
So when I was shown that piece, I was surprised...and couldn't control myself. 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
Ah... Maybe that's why it was so expensive. Five whole ryou... 
 
**Oei:**
Five ryou? That can't be. That's ten times&ndash;no, a hundred times the market price. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
...MEOWHAT. 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
See, Old Meowster...I told you so. It WAS a shady transaction! 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
And Edo's already an expensive city as it is! 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
Old Meowster, looks like you'll be stuck with instant noodl&ndash;no, you'll only be able to afford broth! 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Wh-what the... That's a cat-astrophe! I want super spicy ramen with extra pork belly or something! 
 
**Old Meowster:**
M-money...it's all about the money, isn't it? 
 
**Old Meowster:**
M-Miss Suke...Miss Kaku...this entire meeting must have been fate... 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Why don't you two head over to Hokusai's studio and model for them...? 
 
**Old Meowster:**
You know...show a bit of skin...in an ero style...we'll sign for a generous royalty agreement so we can cash it in...heh heh heh... 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
That is way outside our agreement as travel companions. Not going to do it. Not interested. 
 
**Miss Kakuloe:**
Illysuke seems keen, though. Maybe have her entwine seductively with a giant octopus or something. It's totally her! 
 
**Miss Illysuke:**
What the heck!? I'm not doing that!!! No way! 
 
**Oei:**
Ahaha! Yeah, it'll be for your own sake to not pursue that. 
 
**Oei:**
Unlike the olden days, releasing an enpon or even a single shunga print is tough enough. 
 
**Oei:**
Putting something like that out on the black market is one thing, but openly doing business without a registered seal is a recipe for trouble. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Grrr... I don't have a cat's chance in hell. 
 
**Old Meowster:**
Still, I learned a lot about Edo's ukiyo-e situation! Thanks, dashing geisha girl! 
 
**Old Meowster:**
All right, everyone! Promise Professor Jaguar that if you get a chance you'll Ryou-GO to the museum in Ryougoku! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
She acted like a teacher at the very end! 
 
## One Stroke of Springtime (Erotic) Dream
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
There were a few unbelievable encounters, but let's just delete them from our feeds. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei, while we're walking, would you mind telling us something? I'm just curious... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If we never find your Toto-sama, what happens to you? 
 
**Oei:**
If we can't find him? Well, you know... 
 
**Oei:**
Our client here is the shogun; we're doing this for the top man here in Japan. This is a whole other game from just mouthing off to the police. 
 
**Oei:**
If we offend him, we'll be getting off easy if all he demands is seppuku. 
 
**Oei:**
At worst, he could have us executed, our assets seized, and our family line ended. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Seppuku!? That, like, kills you! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's what happens when you crossthe highest authority in the land...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't that the, uh, Old Meowster call herselfa vice shogun or something...?

**Suzuka Gozen:**
I know! Hey, Oei... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Even if we can't find Toto-sama, why can't you go up in front of the lord? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Sick, right? That was, like, the best idea! 
 
**Oei:**
D-don't be ridiculous! The invitation was for Toto-sama... The actual Katsushika Hokusai! 
 
**Oei:**
Unlike you, I can't just do a magic quick change and show up saying I'm Hokusai... 
 
**Oei:**
...! 
 
**Oei:**
... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Eh, what!? I don't want any stink eye. 
 
**Oei:**
I can't believe it... Well, I had a suspicion... 
 
**Oei:**
An eboshi hat, that dance costume ...and your swordsmanship...! 
 
**Oei:**
Suzuka...are you THE Suzuka Gozen!? The beautiful thief of Mt. Suzuka...!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hm? I am. I didn't mention that? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you know about Suzuka Gozen, Oei?

---
 
**Oei:**
Course I do! I'm a painter, after all! 
 
**Oei:**
Legends and lore from all eras and lands are the tools of the trade for painters like us! 
 
**Oei:**
Toto-sama was always so passionate in collecting reference materials like that. 
 
**Oei:**
Not only does he have popular picture books, but also tons of scrolls, illustrations, and art from Karakuni. 
 
**Oei:**
When I was a child, I enjoyed reading them at his side. 
 
**Oei:**
Then I learned that the reason money's always tight no matter how many paintings get sold... 
 
**Oei:**
...is the vast amount Toto-sama spends on all those reference materials and the cost of paint. Anything left over goes to the disciples' wages. 
 
**Oei:**
After I learned about our situation, I felt a bit conflicted. Haha. 
 
**Oei:**
I see, I didn't realize you were actually Suzuka Gozen. I'm impressed. 
 
**Oei:**
If that's the case...Fujimaru? That just means you must be some sort of famous [♂ sage /♀ fairy]. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm just a plain ol' person.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master's not really a [♂ sage /♀ fairy]; [♂ he's /♀ she's] a mage. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm Tamuramaro.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master? You shouldn't use that name so casually around me. 
 

---
 
**Oei:**
Hee hee. [♂ Mr. /♀ Miss] Master, is it? 
 
**Oei:**
Is that Dutch? It means...“mentor” or “lordship,” right? 
 
**Oei:**
I had a feeling that the people playing Mito Koumon were just messing around... 
 
**Oei:**
But the fact that a [♂ sage /♀ fairy] named [♂ Mr. /♀ Miss] Master is traveling with the real Suzuka Gozen... 
 
**Oei:**
...and the fact that my body moved in an unbelievable fashion and my brush danced with surreal movements... 
 
**Oei:**
...definitely proves that this is all a real dream... 
 
**Oei:**
Ha. A “real” dream... Sure sounds odd to say. 
 
**Oei:**
Don't you think so, Suzuka Gozen? Welcome back to the world of the living. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If it turned out this was all a dream, would you still paint, Oei?

---
 
**Oei:**
You're actually stupid, aren't you, Fujimaru? 
 
**Oei:**
Are you seriously asking a question like that to a painter? 
 
**Oei:**
If you saw a plate of delicious food, even if you were dreaming or the world was ending, you'd still want to eat it, wouldn't you? 
 
**Oei:**
If a [♂ real beauty /♀ handsome fellow] appeared in front of you, you'd fall in love and want to do things with them, right? 
 
**Oei:**
Nothing changes. Birds will fly, butterflies will flutter, fish will swim. And a painter will always want to paint, no matter where they are. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei...you're... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
(Master, I need to talk to you.) 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Suzuka Gozen...?)

---
 
**Oei:**
Come on, we're almost there. Hosshou Temple's right over that hill! 
 
**Oei:**
...What's wrong? Out of breath already? 
 
**Oei:**
If you're going to dawdle, I'm going ahead of you. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oei went in the temple...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, Suzuka Gozen. What did you want to talk about?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master. Don't you think this is all weird AF? Like, something might happen... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...It's faint, but I sense a divine presence from Oei. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And it's getting stronger. When she went into that half-naked courtesan mode... That was just the beginning. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A divine presence? Are you saying she's starting to gain Divinity?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I'm not talking about logic here. My Divine Power is telling me so. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So we're in Oei's dream?
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I can't say for sure, but that's probs the correct assessment. 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
People talk about “false dreams,” or how if you dream something the opposite will happen, right? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What that means is that not everything will necessarily go in your favor in a dream. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Sometimes dreams attract things that a person is subconsciously afraid of...things they never want to happen. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master, you get affected by dreams a lot, right? You should be aware of that by now. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I have a sense that whatever is happening in this dream is ultimately not good for you. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If this super realistic and super detailed dream turns into a nightmare... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...we may end up in over our heads here. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Not only would there be mental corruption, but any spiritual injuries we suffer here in the dream could also affect our physical bodies in Chaldea. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Or, even worse...we may not be able to return at all... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Yeah...I have nothing but bad vibes about this... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really? Do you really think so?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I do see that Hokusai was a godly painter, but...

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey, I don't want to flame Oei either... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...but my job is to warn you, right? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Thanks, Suzuka Gozen.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That's how I roll! And getting advice from a high school girl's gonna cost you! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Why do you look so surprised? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
When we get back to Chaldea, I'm gonna make a special New Year's request that'll be big enough to cover whatever work I do here! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's the sort of advice I'd expect from someone wieldinga sword forged by the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Riiight!? This is totally helpful and literal Clairvoyance on my part! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Oh, one request though: solve this whole mess quick, 'kay? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Don't make me...draw my sword on one of my own... 
 

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Okay! We need to catch up to Oei! Hm? Something on your mind, Master? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you think we're in Katsushika Hokusai's dream?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Not Oei's, but Hokusai's dream? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...That's a good point. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That would make total sense, as Hokusai himself hasn't made an appearance. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So what do you think Hokusai wants to do? Is he afraid that something's gonna break if he does turn up? 
 
**:**
 
【Honjo - Yanagishima, Mt. Myouken, Hosshou Temple】 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So, here we are at Hosshou Temple. Where did Oei go? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you think she found Toto-sama?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master? Over there! Oei's getting flamed by a real boomer. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Wait, whaaa!? Isn't that...!? 
 
**C：???:**
Oh my. I thought I smelled a fake high school girl lurking around. Should've expected you, Suzuka Gozen. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Why're you here!? You're totally ruining the vibes around here! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
A-and my high school girl energy is just low because the sitch is so realtalk! I'm in an adaptive mode! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A kouhai-like character who's sorta like the final boss!?
 
**C：???:**
Awww, what's up with that vague explanation!? That's mean! 
 
**C：???:**
BB is definitely and always will be the final boss, and I have the aura of a superstrong character... 
 
**C：???:**
If Senpai's memory is all mushy like that, then I'm just going to change your thought channels into mashed potatoes☆ 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...BB... 
 
**BB:**
It's BB-chan☆ Don't forget the “-chan” at the end. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...BB-chan!?
 
**BB:**
Yes! Your omnipotent kouhai, the Great Devil BB-chan☆ That's me! 
 

---
 
**BB:**
They tried to make me play a courtesan who works in Yoshiwara under the name of “Sumizome”... 
 
**BB:**
...but never underestimate my special processing power. The moment the calculation spits out void numbers will be the moment I wield my true power! 
 
**BB:**
Know that I have resistance against things like character corruption! 
 
**BB:**
But...I see... Suzuka Gozen on Master's side... 
 
**BB:**
This is getting interesting... Tee hee... 
 
**Oei:**
Hey, Fujimaru... Is this thing a friend of yours? 
 
**BB:**
Thing...!? 
 
**Oei:**
I have no idea what these guys are talking about, especially this “bee-bee” one. 
 
**Oei:**
When I mentioned that I was looking for Toto-sama, they suddenly got really angry and started saying that they won't let me get away with this. Whatever “this” is. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you getting in our way?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who's BB with...?

---
 
**BB:**
Huh? Oh, right! Let me introduce you to this guy... 
 
**BB:**
So, according to our scenario here, this guy is a playboy who is one of my most loyal patrons. And then there's his “bodyguard”... 
 
**D：Playboy:**
Sumizome...come back here! Don't just blunder over into that woman! 
 
**BB:**
It's BB-chan! And don't boss me around! 
 
**D：Playboy:**
I have business with that individual. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gilgamesh!?

---
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Fool! Call me Mr. Gold!!! It's New Year's, for crying out loud! Where's your sense of whimsy? 
 
**Oei:**
Mr. Gold, the playboy, you say? 
 
**Oei:**
You've been awfully loud...laughing and shouting like that! 
 
**Oei:**
You need to be quiet on temple grounds! 
 
**Oei:**
You and that bee-bee... Why're you all so high-and-mighty? 
 
**Oei:**
Ain't there someone in Edo city who I can talk to like a normal person? 
 
**E：Bodyguard:**
I-I'm terribly sorry... 
 
**Oei:**
Oh. You're awfully quiet...even though you look really valiant... 
 
**Oei:**
That dignified stance, that melancholy expression... I don't know why, but I have a feeling I know you from somewhere too... 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
That's my retainer and bodyguard, Omoe. At least in this fleeting dream nonsense, that's how it is. 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
S-so there you have it... I am Omoe... 
 
**Oei:**
Fujimaru. Sorry, but this place turned out to be a dud too. 
 
**Oei:**
It looks like Toto-sama isn't here in this temple either. 
 
**Oei:**
And so we've no business here anymore. Let's just get going. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
No. I will not allow that individual to return. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Or at the least, you will stay here, with me, until tomorrow. 
 
**Oei:**
...!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gil...I mean, Mr. Gold? What do you mean?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Don't tell me Gil&ndash;I mean, Mr. Gold is a part of the Utagawa school scheme, too!? Ugh, I always knew you were a piece of shit. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Nonsense! How dare you throw such plebian insults!!! 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
I've already sent the Utagawa school's publisher, Hoeidou, to the magistrate's office! 
 
**Oei:**
Is that true!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
For real!? That was fast! 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
It is indeed the truth. 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
Some under-the-table transactions were found to have happened, and it turns out that Hoeidou and other Utagawa-related publishers were involved. 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
And as they have been charged with disrupting the peace and morals of the city, they are currently under investigation by officials. 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
Their intent and purpose was likely to undermine the currently missing painter, Katsushika Hokusai. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That's not surprising. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is Mr. Gold here because he's searching for Hokusai too?

---
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Correct. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
However, we instead find none other than Hokusai's daughter, Katsushika Oui. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
I do not consider this a coincidence. 
 
**Oei:**
...Hm? 
 
**Oei:**
I'm grateful that you took care of some of the issues for us. 
 
**Oei:**
I'm not sure if you're some kind of chivalrous figure or something, but this isn't good, Mr. Gold. 
 
**Oei:**
In fact, it's really bad. 
 
**Oei:**
During tomorrow's viewing with the shogun, the painters from the Utagawa school were supposed to demonstrate with Toto-sama. 
 
**Oei:**
But you've turned them in to the authorities... 
 
**BB:**
Oh, I know, me, me! It was supposed to be with the up-and-coming painter named Utagawa Hiroshige, right? 
 
**BB:**
He's very famous even in Yoshiwara! 
 
**BB:**
He's the one who's released a series of ukiyo-e titled “The Fifty-three Stations of the Toukaidou!” He's become indispensable to the Utagawa school! 
 
**BB:**
Don't worry. He's going to make his appearance in front of the shogun tomorrow. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What do you mean? Now the entire Utagawa clique sounds sketch to me! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Sending some creeper out in front of the great lord would be such a disgrace! 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
I agree. But hold your tongue, daughter of the Demon King. If you have sense enough to understand this situation, surely you know what happens next. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Listen, mongrel. Go back to Chaldea. And take that fox-maiden-schoolgirl thing with you too. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
How dare you rate me so low! 
 
**BB:**
Because everything about your appearance and behavior is an imitation. 
 
**BB:**
On the other hand, BB-chan is one hundred percent pure kouhai, inside and out...from the tips of my toes to the end of my pointer! 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
What are you talking about? You are a pretender to the position of kouhai! You are the most bizarre imitation present today! 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
No, enough bickering. Fujimaru. Leave the rest to me. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!?

---
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
I also, wholeheartedly, ask that you leave. This is for your own good. For your own sake. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
B-but...you can't just drop that on us like a surprise album... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Even Oei... 
 
**Oei:**
... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Go back to...Chaldea...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mr. Gold, just how much do you know...?

---
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
All you need to do is to say the words “I'm leaving everything in your hands.” By doing so, you should be able to wake up from this dream. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Listen well, Fujimaru. This situation we face is a true and dire threat to humanity. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
The heretical Demon God Pillar that was separated from the inhuman beast... 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
...has bored a hole into the natural laws of this world with its obsession and distress. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
And from that Abyss, a dread, eldritch creature peered into the real world, and found the perfect madman. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Namely the extraordinary painter...Hokusai. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Just as Divinity fills the body of a saint for an instant to manifest a miracle.... 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
...crystalized evil has sought an appropriate vessel to inhabit. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
This...entity could be described as an evil god, crawling out of the Abyss. A stain upon the world almost as terrible as BB here. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An evil god from the Abyss...!?

---
 
**Oei:**
Ah-ha. I think I'm getting the big picture now. 
 
**Oei:**
So you're telling me that Toto-sama's been possessed by some kind of evil, hellish demon-thing? 
 
**Oei:**
Is that why he suddenly disappeared!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Impossible! That doesn't even make sense! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
A god possessing a human? That's like the sun inhabiting a tree branch or something! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
There's no way a human could stay sane through that! Their mind would burn out in an instant! Like, poof! 
 
**Oei:**
A fire? No, thanks. They're fun to watch, but not when I'm the one burning. 
 
**BB:**
Burn out in an instant, huh? 
 
**BB:**
Do you really think so? I don't think so. 
 
**BB:**
A candle's wick, for instance, is within the flames, but it continues to glow and doesn't burn up. 
 
**BB:**
Isn't it human nature to try to push oneself beyond logic? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Human...?)

---
 
**BB:**
Hmmm, for example... 
 
**BB:**
A Foreigner...an individual who has descended from superstition...is perhaps something to consider? 
 
**BB:**
One who keeps their purity even in the heart of madness. Or perhaps... 
 
**BB:**
...one who is swallowed up by madness, but then turns around and consumes the madness in turn. Such an individual, I believe, could manage it... 
 
**Oei:**
That's so cryptic. 
 
**Oei:**
Even if that were true, what are you planning to do, Mr. Gold? 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
It's obvious! I will break the arm of this dream's owner...I will render Katsushika Hokusai useless! 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
So that he will never paint again! 
 
**Oei:**
!? 
 
**Oei:**
The hell you will!!! Toto-sama would still paint, even if it meant he had to hold the brush with his teeth! 
 
**Oei:**
And if he loses his teeth, he'll paint with his feet! If he lost his legs, he'd paint with his belly button! 
 
**Oei:**
Even if Edo burned to the ground, or if the world ended, it wouldn't matter! 
 
**Oei:**
What hogwash. You sure say some terrible things. 
 
**Oei:**
If you dare try to take Toto-sama's brush, I'll never forgive you...and I'll never let you! 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Do you fail to see that that unworldly frame of mind itself, was what invited the evil god here!? 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
I will not allow anything that came from the Abyss walk this land. Just leave everything to me. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Any dude bro Gil who says things like that is definitely not a Servant of Master's! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
HE'S the evil god's underling! Definitely! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's true...Mr. Gold may not be right.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Exactly! I don't wanna hear any sob stories! And even your theory's true... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
As a Heroic Spirit representing this nation, I will not allow the threat of breaking Hokusai's arm to stand! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I want to see what happens after this dream.
 
**Oei:**
...!!! After...Toto-sama's...dream... 
 

---
 
**Oei:**
Fujimaru... Thank you. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
I suppose fools will always be fools until they die. 
 
**Mister Gold, the Playboy:**
Fine. Very well then. I shall take matters into my own hands! 
 
**Mister Gold of the Touyama:**
Hey! Mongrels! Open those puny eyes and behold! 
 
**Mister Gold of the Touyama:**
You won't scatter my Spirit Origin like golden cherry blossoms! 
 
**Mister Gold of the Touyama:**
There you have it. It is officially your turn to work, BB! Just do some of those special effects of yours! 
 
**BB:**
Whaaa!? 
 
**BB:**
Wh-what the heck is this!? Whaaa!? Nobody told me anything about special effects! 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
That's right... Cherry blossoms are raining down, thick as snow! This is a Blossom Blizzard! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So “BB” stands for “Blossom Blizzard”! Finally, a solution to our longstanding mystery! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Actually, isn't that just a rip-off of my Tower Storm? 
 
**BB:**
N-no it's not! And please stop this!!! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Fu... 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Fuhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!?

---
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I see...so that's what's going on!!! 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I can't believe I didn't realize! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Five seconds ago we were seriously going at it, but he just stopped... Some eureka moment? 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I get it, Oei&ndash;or rather, Katsushika Oui. I have witnessed both the doubts and the hidden ambition of your giant brush. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I cannot clearly see the fate of this father and daughter... As such, I have no right to make a decision. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Honestly, I am keenly interested in this Foreigner situation as well. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
A nation that treats all visitors and outsiders as evil surely has no future. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
So show me. Which will come first? Will humanity crumble away, or will your singular resolve create a new fate? 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I watch in anticipation! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are we really in THAT dire of a situation!?

---
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Of course you are. Enjoy it, mongrel. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
After all, what are humanity and cultural advances worth if one can't keep a sense of humor? 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
A man unparalleled in human history. A man who perfected a pathless road, reaching for the place where truth and fiction meet... 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
...is saying, “Wait.” 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
That wish must be answered. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Huh!? 
 
**Oei:**
... 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Listen. About that exhibition tomorrow... 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I will personally tell the shogun that a painter with great skill will come in place of Hokusai. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
After all, my reputation hangs in the balance as well. 
 
**Oei:**
Wha... To the shogun!? A painter... You're not talking about me, are you!? 
 
**Oei:**
There's no way the shogun would entertain such an absurd request! It would take a magistrate of Edo or something to get him to listen...! 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
It will be all right. Leave the rest of the arrangements to us. 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
And that's why we would like you to continue protecting Oei, [♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Understood.
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
What a dignified response. I like it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about finding Master Hokusai?
 
**BB:**
If that self-proclaimed (?) Wise King has given up on it, then I suggest you follow suit. 
 

---
 
**BB:**
(Sigh) I had a feeling I wasn't going to make much of an appearance... 
 
**BB:**
...but I guess I shouldn't be surprised, because if BB-chan went all out, this whole thing would be over in a snap, and that would ruin everything. 
 
**BB:**
It's best that Fujimaru take care of it, right? If you want something to flail about, that is. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I bet you were going to run away when things got hairy! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Why can't you drop more hints about this Foreigner thing! Come on, if you're really the almighty kouhai! 
 
**BB:**
Ehhh? But that's such a pain. This isn't even a story route where I'm the heroine. 
 
**BB:**
Why don't YOU go all out? Huh!? Suzuka Gozen of the True Clairvoyant Eyes!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Gungh...I didn't want you to go there... 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Be prepared, mongrel. If you really want to understand Katsushika Hokusai's abyss... 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
...know that both great madness and slumbering destruction dwell under the same roof. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Always be mindful of where the stars align. Know that, should you make a mistake, Edo will not be all that sinks. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you for your warning, Wise King of New Year's.
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Heh. I told you, I'm Mr. Gold. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
I only did what a protector of a city is supposed to do. But you know what...Edo has some interesting architecture... What's this&ndash;a wooden house...? 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Is it made of wood because of the weather? Or is it built with the belief that it is going to be rebuilt soon? Well, I suppose its only weakness would be against fire... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think Chaldea'll be fine.
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But if your INT's high, that's totally bad! 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Then do as you please. 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Being wise and intelligent are two separate things. There are foolish wise men out there somewhere. 
 

---
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
Well then...um, my lord. Case closed! ...Right? 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
Since we're done with work, should we go out shopping? I saw this board game that seemed pretty new and excit&ndash; 
 
**Mr. Gold, the Playboy:**
Nonsense, nothing has been concluded yet, fool! You're so earnest, yet why do you seek pleasure so much!? 
 
**Bodyguard Omoe:**
Ouch☆ I-I'm sorry... 
 
**Oei:**
...Whew. They're finally gone. 
 
**Oei:**
They were an eccentric bunch, just like how ink can behave unpredictably on paper... 
 
**Oei:**
Oops, how embarrassing. My clothes got messed up when I went berserk again. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei... 
 
**Oei:**
Ahaha...what a strange dream. Don't make that face, Suzuka. 
 
**Oei:**
Guess I have no choice. You all hungry? Let's go home and order some mochi soup, fit for New Year's! 
 
**Oei:**
Tomorrow is another day. You know the saying... The seeds of thoughts grow overnight and all that! 
 
## First Dream of Edo: True Dream of Chaldea
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Yaawwwn... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...D-don't get the wrong idea. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master's yawn was contagious. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't think I'd be sleepy in a dream...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I ate too much mochi soup...

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey, Oei. Aren't first dreams of the year supposed to only be dreams you see on the night of January 1? 
 
**Oei:**
Yeah. You're not wrong. 
 
**Oei:**
But, in certain regions of the country, I hear it's the January 2 ones. 
 
**Oei:**
After all, Edo has tons of people from so many parts of the nation. 
 
**Oei:**
It doesn't matter when the first dream is, as long as there's more opportunity to sell our paintings. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
She's a bona fide businesswoman. But now that I know the practical side of these paintings, I feel like I can't appreciate them as much anymore... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Hm? Sounds like something is rummaging around through my room... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The octopus seems to be fishing for something...

---
 
**Oei:**
Oh. 
 
**Oei:**
Hey, little Octy is trying to paint. 
 
**Oei:**
Octopuses are pretty smart, you know. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Really? Hey, you're right. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's wrapped its tentacles around a brush and now it's trying to paint on one of Toto-sama's IOUs. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
(But...it's a really bad drawing...) 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Yeah, it's pretty bad...)

---
 
**Oei:**
You're pretty bad, Octy... I think you should give up. 
 
**Oei:**
Ack! 
 
**Oei:**
What's the big idea, you dumb octopus!? I'll throw you into a boiling pot and eat you up! 
 
**Oei:**
...Sheesh...but...(wipe, wipe)...I think this little Octy has some potential. 
 
**Oei:**
Is that a picture of Mt. Fuji? 
 
**F：Oei:**
Ah, no... I'd say it's more like a twisted-up castle. 
 
**F：Oei:**
Your depth perception is all over the place... It's strange... What an odd perspective... 
 
**F：Oei:**
...Ph'nglui...Ph'nglui... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...? Oei? What's that? Ph'n...glui...? 
 
**Oei:**
...Oh. Yeah, it doesn't mean anything in particular. 
 
**Oei:**
It's an incantation that Toto-sama began chanting recently. I don't know, it popped into my head just now. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Incantation...

---
 
**Oei:**
He kept saying that it was useful because pushy salespeople wouldn't get near us...hahaha! 
 
**Oei:**
...Another day, and he still isn't home... 
 
**Oei:**
Dammit, Toto-sama... 
 
**Oei:**
Now, tomorrow is the performance at Sensou-ji. But, I'm ready. I've resolved myself. 
 
**Oei:**
I need to put on makeup, which is something I don't usually do, so tomorrow's gonna be an early day. Best to go to bed. 
 
**Oei:**
Here! Take this! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What is this? It's just a blank piece of paper! 
 
**Oei:**
You wouldn't want to have a dream within a dream, right? So instead of having a picture under your pillow... 
 
**Oei:**
...you put a blank piece of paper there so your dreams don't go wanderin' somewhere bad. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Eh!? That's boring! I want you to draw me a picture of a hot spring or a Ferris wheel! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That makes sense.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Little Octy is really persistent in pushing his picture on to me...)

　　　　　　　 【Main Street Ryougoku】 　　【Showdown between Hokusai and Hiroshige】 
 
**“Shogun”:**
... 
 
**Warrior:**
Bow! Bow! You are in the presence of the great shogun himself! 
 
**Oei:**
(I didn't think...the shogun would be here... What a surprise...) 
 
**Oei:**
(I thought the exhibition was supposed to be in the great hall. What made him change his mind...?) 
 
**Oei:**
(Besides...) 
 
**Oei:**
(So he has finally shown his face... That...Utagawa...Hiroshige...!) 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
... 
 
**Warrior:**
The town painter, Katsushika Hokusai's daughter: Katsushika Oui! Similarly, we have the Utagawa school's rising hope: Utagawa Hiroshige! 
 
**Warrior:**
Both parties, show yourselves! 
 
**Oei:**
Yes! 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
Sir! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Suzuka Gozen...isn't that...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Take a look behind Hiroshige.

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
(Eh? Is that...Da Vinci!?) 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hmm...that's probably Toyokuni. He was the most important person within the Utagawa school during the time that Hokusai was at his most active. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Both Hokusai and Oei totally hate that creep! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like all the actors have assembled.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Shouldn't Da Vinci be the one to perform in the exhibition?

---
 
**???:**
...Heh. 
 
**Warrior:**
Oui... A special nomination from the magistrate in the northern town has allowed you to be here today. 
 
**Warrior:**
I have a message from him: “Show off your extraordinary talent. It's your glorious day to shine.” 
 
**Oei:**
...A personal message from the magistrate himself!? 
 
**Oei:**
I am deeply in his debt. 
 
**Oei:**
I shall express my deep and unwavering gratitude for all that has he done for me in my painting&ndash;which I paint with my all my energy and skill! 
 
**Warrior:**
Hm. Make sure that sentiment is not lost within your heart. 
 
**Warrior:**
Now, let us begin. Both parties, take your brushes and line up. 
 
**Warrior:**
Today we have a most suitable theme for our New Year's celebration. It will be a contest... 
 
**Warrior:**
...of whose Treasure Ship painting is able to fully satisfy our great Shogun's taste! So give it all you got! 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige & Oei:**
Yes! We will humbly submit to your viewing pleasure! 
 
**“Shogun”:**
... 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Warrior:**
Halt! Both parties, put down your brushes and rest. 
 
**Oei:**
...Pant...pant... 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
...This is fine. 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
It was my first time doing a Treasure Ship painting, but I think it turned out pretty good. 
 
**“Shogun”:**
... 
 
**Warrior:**
...Understood. 
 
**Warrior:**
The shogun had this to say: 
 
**Warrior:**
Hiroshige, Oui...you both have performed extremely well. Your skills are exceptional, and it's a shame you two are mere town painters! 
 
**Warrior:**
Our lord has also graciously decided to elevate you both to new positions... 
 
**Warrior:**
...with as much prestige as the Kanou school of painters, who continuously served the household of the great Oda Nobunaga himself. 
 
**Oei:**
!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Y-yay! Way to go, Oei! That's amazing! 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
Oh? Is this like suddenly getting invited to become a court musician or something? 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
This promotion seems wonderful, but it also feels too good to be true. 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
On that note, what about you, Oui? Are you one to snap up the bait? 
 
**Oei:**
...I actually agree. Such a promotion sounds impossible, even if the world were ending tomorrow. 
 
**Warrior:**
However...there is one more thing I must add. 
 
**Warrior:**
For the next painting competition, the shogun is requesting the contest be done in all earnest...with your lives truly at stake. 
 
**Warrior:**
You shall take your brush and paint with your lives hanging in the balance. And those whose paintings do not meet with his approval... 
 
**Warrior:**
...are to commit seppuku! This is why the Sumida River was chosen as the site for the contest! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Wha...!? This isn't supposed to be a duel between swordmasters! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An all-out duel...in ukiyo-e painting!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Isn't this...supposed to be a dream...?

---
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
If I may interject... I am Utagawa Toyokuni, and I am in charge of the entire Utagawa school. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
While this contest has been the utmost honor for us, Hiroshige is a painter who our school has high expectations for. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
There is no way we can risk losing him now. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Therefore, I ask that you allow him to receive assistance... 
 
**Warrior:**
Assistance...? 
 
**Oei:**
...The hell. What's the big idea? 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Oui...you of all people shouldn't require an explanation here. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Paintings by a town painter are made possible through the collaborative efforts of multiple artisans. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Therefore, support is even more necessary when there is so very much riding on the work itself. 
 
**Utagawa Hiroshige:**
Yes, yes. I like that. I'm more versed in writing music than handling paints and brushes, anyway. 
 
**“Shogun”:**
... 
 
**Warrior:**
The shogun has agreed. Do whatever it takes, as long as fine paintings are created. 
 
**Warrior:**
Katsushika Oui. What will you do? 
 
**Oei:**
... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
This isn't fair! This is like comparing the reach of someone with a thousand followers versus one with ten! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
D-Da Vinci!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's going on!?

---
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Heh...what's wrong? Can't decide, Fujimaru? 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
You do have the option to help out Oei, you know. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
But if you're going to participate in this match, your life will be riding on it, too. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you...really Da Vinci...?

---
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Sure. I'm the Da Vinci that you know SO very well. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Because the role of “Toyokuni” is played by the one that you yourself think is most skilled in painting. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
My head hurts...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, WHOSE dream are we in!?

---
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Ah, you already know the answer to that question. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
This is your dream. Without a doubt, this is your dream. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Didn't you see a bunch of familiar faces playing the parts of the townspeople of Edo? They're all near and dear to you. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And even...Suzuka?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
H-hey! Don't look at me like that! I'm different! I would never betray Master! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oei... What about her?

---
 
**Oei:**
... 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Oei's just a girl who hasn't made anything of herself yet. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
She's been behaving like a Servant because that's what you wanted, and you've been projecting that on to her. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
But the one the evil god of the Abyss had set its sight on was always Katsushika Hokusai. 
 
**“Shogun”:**
... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who brought Oei into this dream?

---
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Ah...that's the big question. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Let's review that golden playboy's words. It was Hokusai himself...Hokusai's soul. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Hokusai desired growth. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Even after death, his soul desired to walk the path of the artist, and he rejected being added to the Throne of Heroes. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
That kind of stubbornness likely opened up an opportunity for someone to take advantage of him. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Many of his sketches still remain in the modern world. Mermaids, kappa, water tigers...and the sea devil. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
It's quite detailed and realistic... It's painted as if he actually saw the superstitious creature in person. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Yes... 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
He pored over numerous romantic and fabled tales from around the world. He possessed a vast collection of resources. And within that collection... 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
...it wouldn't be a surprise if one of the books from overseas was a grimoire of spells on the topic of the Sunken Spiral Castle... 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
The monsters of Edo that Hokusai drew seemed dry, and almost fake. They seemed to pale in comparison to other painters' expansive imaginations. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Why? Because he knew. He knew of true evil and horror. 
 
**C：Utagawa Toyokuni:**
The evil god of the Abyss desires... 
 
**C：Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Using your dream as the door, the god desires to descend upon Chaldea...into the real world... 
 
**C：Utagawa Toyokuni:**
...and this is only the beginning of what's to come. 
 
**Oei:**
...Toto-sama... The evil god set his sights on Toto-sama? 
 
**Oei:**
So Hokusai...died... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Oei...

---
 
**Oei:**
...If he's dead, he should stay that way! He shouldn't be so bullheaded, trying to dig his way out of his grave! 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
That's a lie. You're wavering between your struggle to act all strong and your true feelings from within. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Listen, Oui. I'll be blunt with you. You're in the way. You're a burden. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
It's become quite clear that the biggest obstacle to the evil god's plan to use Katsushika Hokusai as a vessel to enter this world... 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
...is you, Oui. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Bad girl. You're a bad, bad, bad girl. 
 
**H：Oei:**
...Ungh... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Da Vinci and the others are getting consumed by the evil god... This is... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master, we're in big trouble! You're going to get swallowed up by the nightmare's corroding effects, too! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Suzuka Gozen! Oei's...!

---
 
**H：Oei:**
I get it... 
 
**H：Oei:**
Toto-sama...left me again... 
 
**H：Oei:**
If that's the case, I have no more regrets... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei! What are you talking about!? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Master! If this is Master's dream, don't get weak-spirited...or else you'll lose! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And Oei, you're nobody's burden! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
You're the one who's been preventing the evil god from descending! You...! Katsushika Oui! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Besides, the evil god from the Abyss doesn't even exist in the first place! It's just superstition! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's just a super realistic fantasy that Hokusai thought up! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Even that Da Vinci over there isn't really its pawn! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's just the temporary materialization of Hokusai's greedy pursuit of madness in this dream! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
The evil god of superstition doesn't have ambitions! There's no heart that needs to be fulfilled! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It is nothing more than a fantasy humans cooked up, something to cling to in their obsession. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But Oei...! Your feelings...your emotions are REAL! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That's why...don't give in! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Yeah...that's right!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't disappear! Come back, Oei!

---
 
**H：Oei:**
Aaahhh...I...am... 
 
**D：???:**
...It makes no sense for the master to interfere in a match between their disciples. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oei...? No...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Katsushika Hokusai!?

---
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Yes, that's right...individuals of Chaldea. I am Katsushika Hokusai. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Using Oei's body... He's...? 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Is that the evil god painter? So she finally gave in to it...and they've merged!? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Fools! I don't care if it's the dragon god of the sea, or the celestial octopus god...! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
My one and only god is the great Northern Myouken Bosatsu! I ain't going submitting myself to any others! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...But it's true that I was susceptible. I was tempted...and that's how things ended up like this. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Listen. All of the world's wondrous nature, up to the last wave of the sea...I'm going to paint with the strokes of my brush. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
That's my wish. I don't need no evil god, nor any Holy Grail's help for that. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
After I sunk deep myself, I finally get it. Think about it...if I turned into a vessel for whatever evil god... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...that thing's not going to want to paint the world's nature as it is... It'll all get painted in its twisted perspective! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
That ain't what a true and proper painter is! 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
...So father and daughter mean to keep lying. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
To keep painting is your desire. Isn't that right, Mr. Hokusai? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Hmph. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Hey, Old Man Toyokuni. Or rather...Da Vinci... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
You of all people, who chose the form of that beautiful lady, should understand. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Oei's my best disciple. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
After my wife died, she's always served me as my right hand. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
She's a great daughter that I'm not worthy to have. So of course I would take her anywhere! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Ph'nglui...Ph'nglui...wgah'nagl fhtagn...! That's the phrase. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Right before I died, I saw it. The face of the evil god... I took a good look with my own eyes. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
So I'm gonna paint it! I'll paint a god, and I'll keep my humanity doin' it! 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
How interesting. 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
Then why don't we commence this painting contest. Should I be the victor... 
 
**Utagawa Toyokuni:**
...channeling through Fujimaru's consciousness, I shall reach Chaldea's Da Vinci... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it...using my sense of defeat...!?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That's not happening! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
As long as I'm around, I'm not going to let Master do anything cringeworthy! 
 
**F：Suzuka Gozen:**
This is my time to shine! I'm putting my high school girl powers to the MAX! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's right, Suzuka Gozen!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's stop this nightmare, once and for all!

---
 
**F：Suzuka Gozen:**
Got it! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Ah, what an auspicious sight. She's like the goddess Benten. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
You're free to show more skin, you know? 
 
**F：Suzuka Gozen:**
I don't have time dealing with pervy old guys! Hurry up and beat up the enemy, and give us back Oei! 
 
**F：Suzuka Gozen:**
Shout, Tower Storm!!! New Year's Cherry Blossom Version!!! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**F：Suzuka Gozen:**
The evil god's presence...is gone...! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Whew... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
The fun we've had during this New Year's dream is coming to its end. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Here you go... I'll draw you a path home. Think of it as the staircase of your dream. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Now go home to your Chaldea. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Hokusai...

---
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
You got put through the wringer this New Year's. No thanks to me. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
There's no use wanderin' around too much. No more tryin' to bait you with offers too good to be true. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
I need to go pay my respects to the great Myouken. If I take too many stops, I'll get in trouble. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going to happen to Oei?

---
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Hm. That's obviously going to be up to the great Myouken. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
But didn't I tell you earlier? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Oei's a part of me. As long as I keep painting, she'll be next to me. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Unless Oei gets tired of me and leaves, that is! Ah-hahaha! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Whatever, Hokusai! Just turn back into your little Octy form! Give us back Oei! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Sheesh, you remind me of my late wife, always badgering. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Anyway, the two of you helped us out. See ya. 
 
**Oei:**
... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Sh-she's back... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei? You okay? Do you remember our names? 
 
**Oei:**
Yeah...I know. Suzuka, Fujimaru. 
 
**Oei:**
I have all my memories, even from when I transformed. 
 
**Oei:**
But...Toto-sama... 
 
**Oei:**
You turned into such an ugly octopus...though you were never exactly easy on the eyes from the get-go... 
 
**Oei:**
Oooh, no inking! Haha! 
 
**Oei:**
We weren't in a dream, but an a even more fleeting illusion. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oei... 
 
**Oei:**
Ahaha. Stop it! I hate sad goodbyes. 
 
**Oei:**
Come on, Fujimaru! You're going back to Chaldea, right? Don't make that kind of face! 
 
**Oei:**
If you keep hanging around here, New Year's will end, and this won't count as a first dream. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I don't like downer endings either. But, this is farewell... 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I'm happy we met. And I had fun. 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I can't paint to save my life, so I'm going to take a selfie to put in my story! 
 
**Oei:**
Selfie? What a weird&ndash; 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
That looks good! 
 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
The background makes the picture shine! By the way, I should introduce you to videos from this lady about room clutter&ndash; 
 
**Oei:**
Shut up. That's none of your business. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Goodbye, Oei.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks so much!

---
 
**Oei:**
Yeah. Right back at you, Fujimaru. You [♂ handsome sage /♀ stylish fairy] you. 
 
**Oei:**
And thanks for reuniting me with Toto-sama. It felt nostalgic...and I was happy... 
 
**Oei:**
S-see you... Take care! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
... 
 
**???:**
I'm in your debt, Mr. Hokusai. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Huh? What...you again? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Where the hell've you been? Or were you just a spectator for all this? 
 
**???:**
Hey, I've done my fair share of helping behind the scene. 
 
**???:**
To reach the very depth of the Abyss, I had no choice but to leave my physical body in another place. 
 
**???:**
Indeed...a certain Demon God had sought out superstition. It tried to have the god from the Abyss descend upon this land... 
 
**???:**
This attempt ended in failure, but for an existence that was empty in the first place, the momentary opportunity was enough. 
 
**???:**
Enough, as far as the course of time and space is concerned, by learning of this earth and merging with Mr. Hokusai's soul. 
 
**???:**
The Demon God has not given up, and it is pursuing another attempt. I did not see or understand this until I was submerged within the abyssal void. 
 
**???:**
We must prevent it. But it appears that this is not something that happens in the future, at least not from Chaldea's point of view... 
 
**???:**
Well, anyway... 
 
**???:**
Mr. Hokusai. As unintentional as it may have been, you have spearheaded the Demon God's conspiracy... 
 
**???:**
I'm impressed you managed to prevent it from going out of control and rampaging across reality. 
 
**???:**
You and Oei have my deepest gratitude. Not to mention the mage of the real world. 
 
**???:**
...It's truly a puzzling thing. Someone who is neither a mage nor a fallen saint... 
 
**???:**
...was able to wield the power of the great evil god, even if it was just a part of it, for themselves... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Heh. Demon God, time and space... Your behavior is more far-fetched and nonhuman to me. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Well...I suppose... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Let me guess...you're under the false impression that you're human. Am I right? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
That's beyond superstition. You're more like an artifice of the world, or the law of nature... 
 
**???:**
...Hm? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Well, no matter. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Hey... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Do you think I...along with those guys...could see more of those phantasmal creatures or beat up more monsters? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
I bet it'll give me a boatload of ideas for painting themes, and I'm really interested. What were they called again... Servants? 
 
**???:**
I thought you weren't going to use the power of the Holy Grail? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Heh. Don't get smart with me. If I ever had money problems, I wouldn't hesitate to beg. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
My daughter, the one within me...my little Ago...seems to want the same thing... 
 
**???:**
I hardly think this is a situation that can be embraced with open arms...but... 
 
**???:**
...nobody can tell what the future holds... I suppose miracles like that can happen. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
I see...heh... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Well then, ain't that just the best New Year's gift I've ever received. 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Ph'nglui...Ph'nglui... 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Ah...to melt and merge to be a part of the mythos... Yeah...I say, bring it on! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Falsehood and fiction are all part of my job... I reckon that's the ultimate dream for an ukiyo-e painter! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
Whenever the Hokusai family is called upon, it will gladly work for free! 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Isn't that right, my little Ago? 
 
**Katsushika Hokusai:**
...Fhtagn...fhtagn...
