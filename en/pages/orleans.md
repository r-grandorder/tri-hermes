## Prelude
 
**A：???:**
&mdash;Heed my words. 
 
**A：???:**
My will creates your body, and your sword creates my destiny. If you heed the Grail's call, and obey my will and reason, then answer me. 
 
**A：???:**
I hereby swear. That I shall defeat all evil in the world. 
 
**A：???:**
But let thine eyes be clouded with the fog of turmoil and chaos. Thou art trapped in a cage of madness, and I the summoner who holds thy chains&ndash;
 
**A：???:**
Seventh Heaven clad in the great words of power! Come forth from the circle of binding, Guardian of the Scales&mdash;! 
 
**B：???:**
Ah! 
 
**A：???:**
&ndash;Thank you for coming, my fellow Servants. I am your Master. 
 
**A：???:**
You know why you were summoned, yes? Destruction and slaughter, those are your orders. 
 
**A：???:**
If a city is reveling in spring, destroy it. If a town is celebrating spring, devastate it. 
 
**A：???:**
No matter how evil or cruel, God will forgive your every transgression. 
 
**A：???:**
Should He mete out punishment,that is fine in its own way. 
 
**A：???:**
For this is no more than a means of proving God's existence and His love. 
 
**A：???:**
&ndash;Now, then, Gilles. Please bring him here. 
 
**Gilles:**
As you wish. 
 
**A：???:**
I trust you have not harmed him, Gilles? 
 
**Gilles:**
No, of course not. Have you considered what you wish done with him? 
 
**A：???:**
&mdash;
 
**Gilles:**
Oh, my. Do you require suggestions from me? 
 
**A：???:**
Oh, you have noticed my distress in your infinite concern for me? 
 
**A：???:**
&mdash;Don't be absurd. If you continue this foolishness, I'll kill you, Gilles. 
 
**A：???:**
When you are eating a meal, do you think about how you use your fork? 
 
**A：???:**
This is the same. What I do with him is a matter so trivial it does not merit any thought. 
 
**H：???:**
...Wh-What's going on? Where am I, and who are you people? 
 
**H：???:**
Answer me! Are you deaf? You there&mdash;Eep! 
 
**A：???:**
Oh, Pierre! Bishop Pierre Cauchon! How I have missed you! 
 
**A：???:**
A day has not gone by when your face has not crossed the mind of Jeanne d'Arc! 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
It can't be. It can't be, it can't be, it can't be, it can't be! 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
Y-Y-Y-You're&ndash;Jeanne d'Arc?! Impossible! This can't be possible! 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
I thought you died three days ago! I thought I killed you! I thought&ndash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
"That you should be in Hell? "Perhaps I am, Your Grace. 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
This is a dream. A nightmare. What else could it be but a nightmare! 
 
**Gilles:**
Oh dear, he's started to flee from reality. This won't do at all. We must snap him out of this. 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
Aiiee! E-E-Eeeee! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What will you do, Your Grace? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Jeanne d'Arc, whom you accused of heresy, stands here before you. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Should you not grip your crucifix and offer up a prayer to God? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Should you not mock me? Scorn me? Abuse me? Trample me? And tell everyone the wicked Jeanne d'Arc is here! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Should you not roar like the brave lion you are?! Go on, do it! Do it! Do it! 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
Spa&ndash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Spa? 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
S-Spare me. Please spare me. 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
I'll do anything. Spare me, I beg of you! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;Ha ha ha ha ha! Did you hear that, Gilles? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
"Spare me, spare me," he says! This bishop who tied me up, mocked me, and burned me alive! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
As if that were nothing! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The bishop who told me with kind eyes, that I was going to be killed. Is now begging for his life! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh&mdash;The sadness is making me want to cry. After all, that won't save anything. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Your paper-thin faith won't reach the Heavenly Father. Belief that is light as a feather won't blossom anywhere. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Someone who has forsaken God, and clings to his life by begging a witch, is unfit to be called a believer. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Do you understand, Your Grace? You just gave testimony that you are now one of the heretics. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That is why I'm so sad. I think I might laugh until madness consumes me. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Now, think back, Your Grace. You know what sentence awaits heretics, don't you? 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
...
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
N-No, no, no! Spare me...Please, spare me! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm so sorry, I'm afraid I ran out of salvation today. Indulgences are not for sale in this era. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Now&mdash;Shall we start at your feet? If I was burned alive by holy flames...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Then your body shall be scorched by the flames of Hell. 
 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
Aaaaaiiiiieeeee&ndash;!! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Not even the ashes remain, I see. I apologize for taking up your time, Gilles. 
 
**Gilles:**
What do you mean? That was a meaningful punishment. Now what should we do with the other clergy. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Good question, it's too much to question them all. Just feed the clergy to them. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Rejoice, my ignoble Servants! The surviving clergy are yours. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I, your Master, Jeanne d'Arc shall forgive you all. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Devour their souls. Feast on their flesh. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Savor their blood. After all, our manifestation is no different than that devil, Dracul. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I have but one order. Wipe out this country, this mistake that is France. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Overrun it, trample it, reap it. Let us begin with our dear Orleans. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
We shall return its fruitful land to a bare wasteland. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Age, gender, and religious beliefs are of no importance. Make sure you kill them equally. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That is the only order I give you as your Master. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
To that end, I have given you all the attributes of a Berserker. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You may be a saint, or a hero, but now you shall dance with your broken soul. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Saber. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Archer. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Lancer. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Rider. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Caster. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Assassin. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And him, whom I summoned instead of Berserker, and myself. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I shall pass down judgement as this world's Ruler. Humanity has no value, for it failed to prove its love for our Lord. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;They are guilty to a horrifying extent. Humanity is equally guilty, sinner and saint alike. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So we shall kill them all. I will not tolerate a single one escaping. 
 
**Gilles:**
Oh...Oh! Such resolve! Such truth without a slightest doubt! 
 
**Gilles:**
Such is the saint of salvation! The saint who believes in our Lord, and saves our people! 
 
**Gilles:**
You have returned...My light has returned...You have truly been reborn, Jeanne! 
 
**Gilles:**
Then I too, shall rise again as your general! First, we need a symbol...Our army must have a flag! 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne, what shall we use as our emblem? A demon, perhaps? Or what about&mdash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
In that case, let's make it a dragon. Be it coincidence or providence, this summoning has brought many with close ties to dragons. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
In the name of dragons, the symbol of catastrophe,we will burn this world to the ground. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh, I have one more order. Laugh. As if you are enjoying yourselves from "the bottom of your heart. "
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Heh heh heh. Ah ha ha&ndash;Hahahahaha! Ahahahahahaha!! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Wonderful! This is wonderful, Gilles! I've never enjoyed myself this much in my entire life! 
 
**Gilles:**
YesYes, I suppose it is. That is the way it should be. 
 
**Gilles:**
You were put on a pedestal, made a symbol,exploited, and cast aside by the people&mdash;
 
**Gilles:**
That is why you are righteous. There is no one who could pass judgment over your heart of hearts! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou? Kyu, fou? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good morning, Fou. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think I just had a bad dream...
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Mew, fou! Kyau, kyau! 
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. It's finally time for the briefi&mdash;Eek! 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuuuuu...
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, Fou, I couldn't get out of the way. Still, I'm glad to see you so full of energy in the morning. 
 
**Mash:**
You too, Senpai. Did you sleep well last night? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Like a log. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm glad to hear it. They say it takes talent to get a good night's sleep. 
 
**Mash:**
I know you just woke up, but it's briefing time. We should hurry. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't get much sleep...
 
**Mash:**
...Oh, I forgot you sleep better on the floor or a tatami mat instead of a bed. That was my mistake, I'll make arrangements. 
 
**Mash:**
Still, the Doctor's briefing is about to start. Let's try to power through the sleepiness. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good morning, Fujimaru. Did you sleep well? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's get right to the briefing, then. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For starters...Oh right,let me go over what I want you to do again. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
First, the investigation and correction of the singularities. It is humanity's critical turning point in that era. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If it were not for that, we could never have come as far as we have. It is the pivotal "event" in human history. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You must travel to that era, investigate what it is,figure it out, and then correct it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Otherwise, 2019 will never come. Humanity will be extinct in 2018. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That is your first objective. The basic principle of the upcoming operation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The operation's second objective is Investigate the "Holy Grail. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is just my speculation, but the singularities must be related to the Holy Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The "Holy Grail" is a relic that can grant wishes. A vessel that contains tremendous amounts of magical energy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Lev probably got his hands on the Grail in some form, and misused its power. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rather, it's impossible to travel through time and change the past without the Grail. Seriously. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You will run into intel regarding the Grail during your investigation of the singularity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if you correct history, leaving the Grail will put us back to square one. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You must either secure the Holy Grail, or destroy it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Those are the two objectives of this operation. Is everything clear so far? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Crystal clear. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Glad to hear it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, could you go over it again? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, fine. But pay attention this time, okay? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...And now, there's one other thing I want you to do in addition to the mission. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That said, it's nothing major. It's for after you Rayshift to that era. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I want you to find a leyline and make a summoning circle. Just like you did in Fuyuki. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unlike Fuyuki, we could probably make do as-is if it's just telepathic communication...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But to transport supplies, it won't work without establishing a summoning circle. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just like before, once Mash sets up her Noble Phantasm it will act as a catalyst and trigger the summoning circle. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Once you do that, you can summon Servants at will. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course, what you summon will probably be Servants closely tied to that time and place. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So keep doing that to bolster your forces. Understood? 
 
**Mash:**
...Understood. Before all else, we'll try to establish a base camp first. 
 
**Mash:**
What we'll need is a place to relax, a structure with a roof, a home to come back to. Right, Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, I'll be counting on you. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Right. You have a way with words, Mash. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
H-Hearing you say that, really means a lot to me. 
 
**Mash:**
I know I'm still an inexperienced Servant,but you can count on me. I'll be giving it my all! 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Umhm. To see Mash, who's serious, quiet, and frankly,kind of mysterious, grow up to be such a fine lady...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey, get over yourself. How long are you gonna keep me waiting? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oops, you're right. You didn't show any interest so I forgot you were there. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Allow me to introduce you, Fujimaru. He...no, she...er, it? Um, who? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sheesh. Standing there is Chaldea's pride and joy,the head of our Engineering Department, Leonardo. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As you can tell, they are quite unusual. Of course, not a human...Let's not get into that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The reason being&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...A Servant. Senpai, this is incredible. This person is a Servant! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right you are～♪ I'm Chaldea's honorary tech advisor, I normally go by Leonard here. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But as you can see, I am the proud inventor of the Renaissance! The one-and-only Leonardo da Vinci in the flesh! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can just call me Da Vinci. You don't get to see many pretty ladies like myself around here right? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? Pretty lady? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Da...Vinci? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
This is strange. It's abnormal. It's wrong! I mean, Leonardo da Vinci should be a man&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
You should always question conventional wisdom. But, is it really that important? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Who was the first one that claimed I was a man or a woman? Sheesh, for crying out loud. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I pursue beauty with both my inventions and art. It was I who personified all ideals&mdash;all beauty. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
To me, the ideal beauty is the Mona Lisa. That being the case&mdash;See? Isn't this simply an unavoidable result? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I like to think of myself as a scholar, but this guy's pet theories go way over my head. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's the only pervert twisted enough to turn himself into the Mona Lisa, just because he loves the Mona Lisa. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Heh heh. Are you sure about that, Dr. Roman? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
As cultures mature, anything is possible. The desire to become a beautiful girl might one day be the norm. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That might be true, but which time period's Heroic Spirit are you? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Genius has nothing to do with time period, Doctor. Fujimaru, you'd do well to remember that too. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You will encounter many Heroic Spirits who were artists. Every one of them is as splendid and eccentric! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are you kidding me? Still, I can see that being the case! 
 
**Mash:**
I see. It's true that I didn't want to know too much,but thank you for the advice, Da Vinci. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's my girl, you're always so understanding. Ok, that's enough for my introduction. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
From now, I will be focusing on supporting you with supplies, R&D within Chaldea, and updated Heroic Spirits' contracts. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I am a Servant summoned by Chaldea, you see. Unlike Mash, I cannot jump to any era. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
However, if Fujimaru has a contract with me, then it would be another matter. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I would then be able to aid you as an ordinary Servant. I'm looking forward to such a fate, Master. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Wow, he really did introduce himself and run off. Now, as I was saying before I was interrupted...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sorry but we don't have time to rest. We're going to prep for immediate Rayshift, ok? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. I'm ready to go at any time. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Well, if I have to. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, we have a coffin ready for you this time. You should be able to Rayshift safely and quickly now. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Seven singularities have been detected, but we've selected the time period with the smallest fluctuations. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Once you get there, we'll only be able to communicate with you. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Got it? I know I'm repeating myself, but the first thing is to set up a base camp and finding a leyline. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
After you've settled into the era, do what needs to be done. All right&mdash;Good luck, Fujimaru. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Unsummon Program start. Spiritron Conversion start. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...
 
**Announcement A:**
All procedures cleared. Grand Order commencing operation. 
 
## Section 1: Land of the Hundred Years' War 
 
**Mash:**
...Sigh. We managed to reach here safely, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
We were teleported by accident last time. This time it's a proper teleport via the Coffin with no physical anomalies. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou! Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
Fou? Did you tag along again? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...kyuu, kyao...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can Fou Rayshift too? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did he sneak into Mash's Coffin? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Seems that way. He must have sneaked into mine or Senpai's Coffin. 
 
**Mash:**
Luckily, Fou was unharmed. 
 
**Mash:**
Since he is attached to one of us, when we return he will automatically return as well. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In that case, no problem, right? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I need to get back safely for Fou's sake, too. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. We share the same fate. 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Master. I have confirmed the time axis coordinates. Looks like it's the year 1431. 
 
**Mash:**
It means we're in the middle of the Hundred Years' War. But this should be during the war's respite period. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Respite? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wars get time-offs? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, The Hundred Years' War did not fight for the full 100 years as the name implies. 
 
**Mash:**
The war during this era was pretty carefree, relatively speaking. 
 
**Mash:**
Captured knights were released for monetary payments almost every day...Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Look at the sky. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
What is...Huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, we're connected! Not the best quality, but I've got video feed now too! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, what's wrong you two? Both of you staring at the sky like that. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, I'll send you visuals. What is that? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A ring of light...No, some form of magecraft cast over the satellite orbit? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In any case it's gigantic. At worst, it's as big as North America? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm, no records show such phenomena occurring in 1431. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's surely one of the reasons for the disappearance of our future. We'll have to analyze it on our end...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You guys concentrate on surveying onsite. Start by searching for leylines. 
 
**Mash:**
What the Doctor said. 
 
**Mash:**
Explore the area, make contact with the people of this era, set up the summoning circle, there are many things to do. 
 
**Mash:**
We have to knock them out one at a time. Let's first move towards a city, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, stop. Confirming...Looks like a French scout brigade. 
 
**Mash:**
What do we do? Should we attempt to make contact? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do that. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't it dangerous? 
 
**Mash:**
They look like humanoids. I'm sure we can come to a peaceful resolution. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Hello, excuse me. We are travelers&ndash;
 
**Soldier:**
...
 
**Mash:**
? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Soldier:**
Eek! Enemy attack! Enemy attack! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yoo-hoo, I'm free now so lemme see how you're...Wait, why are you surrounded by an armed group? 
 
**Mash:**
...I apologize. My mistake. I should've greeted them in French. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Was that the problem!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They know what you're saying to begin with? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Of course. But now, I believe that combat is unavoidable. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're starting with a fight? With French elites, even! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-Well, let's calm down first! That world is isolated. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No matter what happens, a time paradox can't occur. So engaging them won't be a problem, but...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, give us an idea. Don't you know any French jokes for times like this? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hell if I know, I'm a loner! But wait, let me think...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I just need to think of a witty joke, right? Like "knock, knock! "
 
**Soldier:**
I'm hearing a silly voice from somewhere...All hands, ready your weapons! They're too suspicious! 
 
**Mash:**
I apologize, Senpai. It was wrong of me to expect something from the Doctor. 
 
**Mash:**
I think it would be bad to harm the locals. We should attack to hold them back! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are YOU talking about now, Mash? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You've stooped as low as Roman! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
D-Did I say something wrong? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In that case, hit them with the back of your blade! Limit the bloodshed to a minimum! Back of the blade! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
With a shield? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How would you...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I-I'll think of something! FIREEE! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, burning is out of the question too! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Sigh. Physical fatigue aside, the mental fatigue is overwhelming. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you all right? 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much, Senpai. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good job using the back of your blade. 
 
**Mash:**
I didn't even know that was possible with a shield. I learned something today. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
But...
 
**Mash:**
It seems like I didn't hit hard enough. They've retreated. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're going back to their fort. Let's quietly chase them and ask what's going on. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Try not to aggravate them next time. Make sure you talk to them in French, okay? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that, bonjour. 
 
**Mash:**
Bonjour, monsieur.... I see, perfect. Leave it to me. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Roger that, danke schoen. 
 
**Mash:**
Danke schoen, Herr. I see, somewhat perfect. I'll leave it to you. 
 

---

 
## Section 2: Chase the French Soldier 
 
**Mash:**
This is...Awful, isn't it? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a complete ruin on the inside...The outer wall is more or less intact, but you can't call this a fort. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Because it's wartime? 
 
**Mash:**
...No, that would still be impossible. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nothing but wounded soldiers here. 
 
**Mash:**
That's right. Even though they're not in an active war&ndash;
 

---

 
**Mash:**
In 1431, Charles VII of France entered a peace treaty with Philip III, an ally of England. 
 
**Mash:**
Of course, I'm sure there were some skirmishes&ndash;
 
**Soldier:**
Argh! Here they come again! 
 
**Mash:**
Bonjour. We are travelers. 
 
**Mash:**
We are not here to harm you. Please put down your weapons, monsieur. 
 
**Soldier:**
You're not...the enemy? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm, that was rather easy. Perhaps they're rational now. Or&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They have no more fight left in them? 
 
**Mash:**
Why didn't Charles VII sign the peace treaty? 
 
**Soldier:**
King Charles? So you don't know? 
 
**Soldier:**
The king is dead. He was burned by a witch's flames. 
 
**Mash:**
...Dead? By witch's flames? 
 
**Soldier:**
It's "Jeanne d'Arc. "She has risen again as the "Dragon Witch. "
 
**Soldier:**
England retreated quite a while ago. But, where have we to run to? 
 
**Soldier:**
This is our home, but there's nothing we can do. 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne d'Arc is a witch? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who is Jeanne d'Arc? 
 
**Mash:**
Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the savior. She is a world-renowned hero. 
 
**Mash:**
A woman who stood up to save France from being conquered in the late stages of Hundred Years' War. 
 
**Mash:**
She saved France at age 17, and managed to reclaim Orleans in just one year...
 
**Mash:**
But she was caught by the English army,and after an inquisition, burned at the stake. 
 
**Mash:**
They say that from the time of her imprisonment till her burning, she endured gruesome torture and humiliation daily. 
 
**Mash:**
England wanted to prove that she was not a saint, but a heretic. 
 
**Mash:**
So they tried to torture her into saying"I did not hear the Lord's voice. "
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;However, her heart remained true. Even while burning, she held onto her prayers. 
 
**Mash:**
Later, her honor was recognized, and after 400 years she was officially made a saint. 
 
**Mash:**
A powerless girl's wishes changed the world&mdash;In that regard, Jeanne d'Arc is definitely a top-rank Heroic Spirit.

**Fujimaru 2:**

**Soldier:**
Here! They are here! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Magical energy signals are heading here! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Familiars created using human bodies...skeleton soldiers. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This time it's different. Both of you can be as wild as you want! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Orders, Master! Let's pulverize them! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Phew. Good work. 
 
**Soldier:**
You guys, I can't believe you took them on. 
 
**Mash:**
...We're used to it. Anyway I'm sorry, but could you please explain this from the start? 
 
**Mash:**
Is it true that Jeanne d'Arc has been resurrected? 
 
**Soldier:**
Yes. I took part in the siege of Orleans and the ceremony, so I remember it well. 
 
**Soldier:**
Her hair and skin color are different, but there's no question that she's the saint from the past. 
 
**Soldier:**
Hearing that she'd been captured by the English and burned at the stake, we trembled in fury. 
 
**Soldier:**
But&ndash;she was resurrected. And through a pact with the devil, no less! 
 
**Mash:**
What do you mean the devil? Like the skeleton soldiers earlier? 
 
**Soldier:**
Not those. At least those we can handle ourselves. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Soldier:**
Dammit, just as I thought! Here they come, engage! 
 
**Soldier:**
Come on, stand up! Dragons are here! If you don't resist, they'll eat you! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Large creatures are shown to be near you! They're moving in fast! 
 
**Mash:**
Visual confirmed! But that...It can't be&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dragons!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wyverns!? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. That is a subspecies of dragons called wyverns. 
 
**Mash:**
That is definitely a creature that should not be in 15th Century France! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's coming! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, respond with full force! This is different from those old bones from earlier! 
 
**E：???:**
Soldiers, douse yourself with water! You can momentarily defend against their flames! 
 
**Soldier:**
Eh? 
 
**E：???:**
You there! Please pick up a weapon and fight! 
 
**E：???:**
Together with me! Follow me&ndash;! 
 
**Mash:**
This is...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, she's a Servant! But her energy is weak, what is she...
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...I believe that was the last. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, fine job everyone! I was watching with sweaty palms and sweets in my hand! 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor. Those were the sweets that I got, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? What? Is that right? I found them in the Command Room next to the tea, so I thought...
 
**Mash:**
...I got them as a token of gratitude, for when we return from this Order. 
 
**Mash:**
Needless to say, they weren't for you, but for Senpai, who no doubt fought bravely on the frontlines. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash...you've become such a thoughtful person...(gobble, gobble)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I must say, these are some really tasty sweets. I'm sure Fujimaru will be thrilled, too! 
 
**Mash:**
...Master. When we return to Chaldea, please reserve enough combat resources for one attack. 
 
**Mash:**
I've registered one more enemy that I'd like to hit with the "back of my blade. "
 
**Soldier:**
Impossible, you're&ndash;No, no way! Run! The witch is here! 
 
**Mash:**
Eh, a witch? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Jeanne:**
Um. Thank you very much. 
 
**Mash:**
No, that was nothing. Before that, your name&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
"Ruler. "My Servant class is Ruler. 
 
**Jeanne:**
My True Name is Jeanne d'Arc. 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne...d'Arc? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The one that became a witch...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought she was dead. 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
We'll talk about that later. It is nothing we should speak of in front them. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Come over here. Please. 
 
**Mash:**
...We've been invited. What should we do, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's follow her. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a clue. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Kyu kyu kyuu! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I agree as well. She looks weakened, but she's a Servant, too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure she's aware of the situation in this era. Let's ask her for details. 
 
## Section 3: Jeanne's Mystery 
 
**Jeanne:**
...They are few in number, but there does seem to be some evil presences. 
 
**Jeanne:**
We are close to the fort. Before they invade, let's take them out. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
The enemy has been wiped out. Good job. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes. I think we can settle down here. 
 
**Jeanne:**
First, please tell me your names. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. My Individual Name is Mash Kyrielight. 
 
**Mash:**
This is Fujimaru. My Master. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Master? So there are Masters even in this Holy Grail War. 
 
**Mash:**
No, it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. I am just a Demi-Servant. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Demi-Servant? 
 
**Mash:**
Not a true Heroic Spirit. Have you heard of us? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Right. We should probably clear that up first. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I am indeed a Servant, my class is Ruler. I understand that. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But...A majority of information about the Holy Grail War that should be provided is missing. 
 
**Jeanne:**
No, not just information. My stats have ranked down as well. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Not only have I lost the anti-Servant Command Spells,I can't even reveal their True Names anymore. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Luckily this is my homeland where I was born and raised. If nothing else I still speak the language...
 
**Mash:**
That soldier earlier was saying that Jeanne d'Arc turned into a "Dragon Witch". 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Having just materialized a few hours ago, I am not sure what's going on. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It seems there is another Jeanne d'Arc in this world. 
 
**Jeanne:**
A Jeanne that murdered King Charles VII of France, and committed the slaughter at Orleans...
 
**Mash:**
So does that mean two of the same Servants have been summoned in the same era? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm...If we could access the Holy Grail War's records, there should be examples of simultaneous summons. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, one thing is for sure. Charles VII is dead, and Orleans has been occupied. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Which symbolizes the collapse of the nation of France. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In history, France was the first nation to declare human liberty and equality. Many countries followed suit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Delaying this by 100 years would stagnate civilization. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Without progress we might still be stuck in the Middle Ages. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I just heard a voice...Is that magecraft? What in the world are you all&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh that's right, we didn't introduce ourselves. Nice to meet you, Saint Jeanne d'Arc. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
My name is Romani Archaman. Everyone calls me Roman. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I do various support tasks. Nice to meet you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I see, Roman. You tend to be a dreamer! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...What is this sense of defeat? She complimented me, but I'm not happy at all...
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, Mademoiselle Jeanne. It's our turn now. 
 
**Mash:**
Our objective is the correction of this twisted history. We belong to an organization by the name of Chaldea. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...I see, I understand now. To think that the world itself has been incinerated. 
 
**Jeanne:**
My worries were so trivial. But now, I&mdash;
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm an incomplete Servant, and even I cannot trust "myself. "
 
**Jeanne:**
The Jeanne 'd'Arc that occupied Orleans...Not only that, but those flying dragons...
 
**Mash:**
You mean the wyverns...There is no way wyverns existed in the 15th century France. 
 
**Mash:**
More importantly, he called you a "Dragon Witch". 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, I don't want to admit it, but the person controlling those dragons must be "myself. "
 
**Jeanne:**
I have no idea how she's controlling them. I never thought about such things during my life. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Summoning dragons is the highest form of magecraft, let alone to have this many&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's an impossible feat for modern mages. It should be difficult even for this era's magecraft. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That means...Fujimaru. If there's anything that could bend rules like this...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...It's likely to be a Holy Grail? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Exactly. It's only speculation, but these are no longer someone else's problems. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Smooth over chunky? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're still bringing that up? You're pretty vindictive, aren't you? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I see, there are still many unclear points, but I have an idea now. 
 
**Mash:**
Mademoiselle Jeanne. What are you going to do from here? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...The objective is clear. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Head to Orleans, and take back the city. To do that, I must exterminate the Jeanne d'Arc who stands in my way. 
 
**Jeanne:**
The Lord didn't show me the path, but I cannot turn my back on this. 
 
**Mash:**
Even alone, you will fight...She's just like history says, Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I thought so, too. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A startling difference from Da Vinci. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master, and Doctor. Our objective and Ms. Jeanne's are the same. 
 
**Mash:**
I was thinking about our next course of action...How about we help her? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course, I thought the same. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd help even without a mission. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right. It's best to work together with Jeanne here. It's a rare honor to fight alongside a Saint and Savior! 
 
**Mash:**
Good. Then once again, Mademoiselle Jeanne. 
 
**Mash:**
We have our own objectives, but we want to be of aid to you. 
 
**Mash:**
Will you allow us to fight under your flag as your companions from now on? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh...The pleasure will be all mine. I cannot possibly thank you enough. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Thank you, Mash, Fujimaru. I thought I would be in this fight all alone. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Now at this place and time, we shall fight as one. So, Fujimaru, please give us your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm so ashamed that I said I'd fight on my own earlier. Thanks to you two, I feel stronger than ever. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Even if I'm up against myself, a witch, I have nothing to be afraid of now the two of you are with me. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Being called a witch...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you all right? 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
I am fine. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Needless to say, it saddens me that they'd mistake me for that other Jeanne. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But it can't be helped. 
 
**Jeanne:**
In fact, it hasn't been more than a few days since I was burned at the stake...
 
**Jeanne:**
If a resurrected me caused a massacre in Orleans, then I can't blame them for being scared of me. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...I was afraid the British might be stirred up, but it would appear things are going smoothly. 
 
**Jeanne:**
We should seek out the Jeanne who they call a witch and defeat her. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But for now, we should scout around first. The goal is simple, but reaching it not so much. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As expected, Jeanne d'Arc is well-versed in the art of the war. Like she said, an assault on Orleans is ill-advised. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's an unfamiliar land and we have yet to set up any bases. For now, take the initiative and gather intel on their defenses. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As for the witch Jeanne&ndash;Or shall we call her Dark Jeanne? I would like to find out what kind of Servant she is. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The rest is up to our forces. It would be good to have more allies. 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne, is there a reading on any other Servants besides ourselves? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm sorry, but as I am now, I am incapable of using my ability as a Ruler to detect other Servants. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Like other ordinary Servants, I cannot detect them unless I am within a certain distance. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait, what about the other Jeanne? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rulers can detect Servants? 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
I was careless. There is that possibility. 
 
**Jeanne:**
The other me...No, Witch Jeanne...Urgh, it's too confusing, I will also refer to her as Dark Jeanne! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Anyway, if that Dark Jeanne is truly a Servant then her Class, like mine, is Ruler. 
 
**Jeanne:**
If that is the case, she will immediately be able to detect our location. We must be prepared for battle at all times. 
 
**Jeanne:**
If possible, I would like to minimize our activities in any nearby towns and villages&mdash;
 
**Jeanne:**
But without any lead on our hands, I doubt that's possible. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let us head out early tomorrow morning. Fujimaru is human and should probably get some sleep...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll do that then. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you all right? 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, I am fine. 
 
**Jeanne:**
My abilities may have gone down in rank, but I still possess the basic abilities of a Servant. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Well, good night. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Did Fujimaru go to sleep? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, surprisingly quick for someone who is unfamiliar with sleeping outdoors. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Is that so...
 
**Mash:**
...I could be imagining things, but is there something you aren't telling us? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Mash:**
I don't mean to pry...
 
**Mash:**
I thought it best to confront you in case it should become an obstacle in battle. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Quite right. As you wish, I shall tell you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It could be because my summoning was incomplete. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Or&ndash;perhaps it's because my original self died just a few days ago. 
 
**Jeanne:**
How can I put it? It feels as if I am a "brand-new Servant. "
 
**Mash:**
A rookie, you mean? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes. There is no future or past in the Throne of Heroes. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But, I don't have the power to access the records there. Therefore, it is difficult for me to act as a Servant. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It feels like going into battle for the first time all over again. And that bubbly-looking mage from before...
 
**Jeanne:**
He called me a saint and savior, but even with that expectation, I have no such power. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...So, the thing is. I fear that I will become a burden to you. 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne, if that's all then it's all right. 
 
**Jeanne:**
What? 
 
**Mash:**
I mean, this also feels like my first battle. We are the same. 
 
**Mash:**
As a Demi-Servant, I cannot fully harness my power as a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Mash:**
However, the Heroic Spirit inside of me said "It's okay. "
 
**Mash:**
And Senpai&mdash;Master, trusts someone like me. 
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know how to say this, but Senpai didn't choose to fight to prove something. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai is simply trying to do what should be done, I think. 
 
**Mash:**
So, it's all right. There's no reason for you to worry. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Thank you. I feel a little better. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I am pretty familiar with this era and this country. Let's give it our best tomorrow! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 
## Section 4: Information Gathering 
 
**Jeanne:**
First, let's cut through this forest and head to Orleans. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Of course, it will be difficult to enter directly. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But we might be able to get some information from the surrounding towns and forts. 
 
**Jeanne:**
We're almost at La Charite. 
 
**Jeanne:**
If we can't get any information here about Orleans, we'll have to get closer&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
I'd rather avoid that as much as possible. 
 
**Jeanne:**
As long as I am still uncertain about the forces we have, we cannot engage. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're really cautious. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're really calm. 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
...No, to be honest, I am panicking. No matter how you look at it, the other "me" cannot be in her right mind. 
 
**Jeanne:**
What that monster will do by controlling the people&ndash;it's easy to imagine. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Overwhelming power and hatred can easily destroy a person, no matter how noble they are. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;Wait a minute. A Servant was detected just ahead of your current path. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Its location is in La Charite, which is your destination. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh, it's getting further away. Oh no, I've lost it! It's too far away! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou!! 
 
**Mash:**
What is it Fou? Suddenly climbing on my head? You want to see the sky over there? 
 
**Mash:**
The town...It's burning? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let's hurry! 
 
**Jeanne:**
It couldn't be! 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, life form detection&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...It's no use! There's nothing alive left in that town. 
 
**Mash:**
It can't be&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
Wait. Just now, a sound! 
 
**Mash:**
Wait a minute, that's&ndash;! 
 
**Jeanne:**
No...It can't, be! 
 
**Mash:**
Looks like they've turned into the living dead. Master, I will scatter them! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne:**
Gasp, gasp, gasp...
 
**Mash:**
Are you all right? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes. I'm fine&ndash;
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
...They're still here. They look like wyverns. 
 
**Mash:**
Are they...Ugh, no way! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are they devouring the corpses? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Stop it! 
 
**Mash:**
I'm going! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;That was the last of the wyverns. No sign of the enemy nearby. The battle is over. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...It was most likely "me" who was behind this. 
 
**Mash:**
We can't be sure of that yet&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
No, I can tell. I am sure of it.... There's just one thing I don't understand. 
 
**Jeanne:**
How much do you have to hate others to wreak such havoc? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I can't understand it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hold up! The Servants that just left have reversed course! This isn't good. They must've realized you're here! 
 
**Mash:**
How many? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You must be kidding. There are five! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're fast...Are those Riders or something? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We don't stand a chance against them! We must run! 
 
**Mash:**
But&ndash;! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We might be able to face them if we had the same numbers. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But there's no way you can fight an opponent that's several times stronger than you, is there? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's retreat, as any sane person would! It says so in the 36 Strategies of War! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne! Servants are closing in&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
...I won't run. I must at least find out what their true intentions are! 
 
**Mash:**
But! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's no use, we won't make it! Mash, just run, got it? 
 
## Section 5: Dark Jeanne 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Ugh! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;What, on earth? Who knew...Who knew such a thing could happen? 
 
**Jeanne:**
&mdash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Could someone please pour some water on me. This is bad. It's awful. I think I'm really going to lose it. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's so funny I might die from laughing! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Take a look Gilles! Look at that pathetic girl! What is she a wimp? A mouse? A worm? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Either way, they're all the same! So puny, I can't even muster any sympathy! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Ah...truly&mdash;a country that could only cling to "me"...comparing them to mice is an insult to mice. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hey, Gilles, don't you think so&mdash;Oh, I see. We didn't bring Gilles along. 
 
**Jeanne:**
You...Who are you? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I could ask the same of you...Right, as a leader, let me answer that. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am Jeanne d'Arc. The saint devoted to France...the other "me. "
 
**Jeanne:**
What? That's nonsense. You are no saint. Just as I am no saint. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But, that is already a thing of the past. More importantly&mdash;Why did you attack this town? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Why, you ask? As the same Jeanne d'Arc,I thought you would understand. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Are you stupid now that your alignment has changed? The reason I attacked this city? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What a foolish question. It's obvious, isn't it? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It is for the sole purpose of destroying France. I am, after all, a Servant. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Politically, economically, these methods take too long. Is it not better to simply physically crush everything? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Such foolishness! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
"Such foolishness? "The foolish ones are us, Jeanne d'Arc. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Why did you want to save this country? Why did you want to bring salvation to these people? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
All the while knowing that they are the ones who spit on and betrayed us! 
 
**Jeanne:**
That is&ndash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I will be fooled no longer. I will be betrayed no longer. I no longer hear the voice of the Lord. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The fact that I cannot hear His voice, means the Lord no longer blesses this country. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So, I will destroy it, in accordance to the Lord's grief. I will cut away all the bad seeds at the roots. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
As long as the human race exists, so will my hatred. I will remake this France into a land of the dead. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's how I will save this country. By the hands of the new Jeanne d'Arc, reborn through death. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I suppose you could never understand. Always playing the saint. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Impossible for a pretty little holy virgin who pretends not to see hatred and joy and is incapable of human growth! 
 
**Jeanne:**
I...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, what is human growth to Servants? If you're going to call it something, you would rank up as a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;There appears to be a noisy fly here. Should I kill it if it's gets too annoying? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, wha-, the console's on fire! That Servant can burn her enemies with just a glare!? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Are you really "me"? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I have played my part for you so clearly, yet you still have doubts? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
This rage is an ugly justice. It's not that you cannot understand it, you do not even have the will to try. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But, I understand. Seeing you, I have realized all there is to the Heroic Spirit that is myself. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You are neither Ruler nor Jeanne d'Arc. You are nothing but some leftover residue that I threw away. 
 
**Jeanne:**
!!! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If you were the same existence and Class as I, then I should have felt something. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But you are worthless. Nothing but a ghost with a misguided effort to recreate history. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Lancer, Berserk Assassin. Finish off that country girl. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You're getting tired of small prey, aren't you? Rejoice, they are strong. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Among all the Servants I summoned, your thirst for blood is the strongest. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You exist to crush the brave. Devour them to your heart's content. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
&mdash;Very well. Now, I will have your blood. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Not so fast "my King. " I would like to partake of her flesh and blood, as well as her insides. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
So greedy. And her soul? Who gets to take her soul? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
There is no gain in taking her soul. Do you think honor or reputation can maintain my beauty? 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Very well. Then I shall take her soul. It's quite ironic though. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
I am able to understand her beauty, only after I have fallen as a blood-sucking devil. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Yes. That is precisely why I cannot hold back my emotions. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
I will not forgive anything more beautiful than me. No, more than that&mdash;
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
The blood of those more beautiful than me, can only elevate my beauty! 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Ah, how fun it is to crush such fresh fruit. I'll throw away the skin and just enjoy the juice&mdash;
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
This is the privilege of being a Noble of the Night. I'll squeeze every last drop out of you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Ugh! 
 
**Mash:**
...Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do this. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We have no other option. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne! Get ready, they're coming! 
 
**Jeanne:**
U-Understood! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
I can't believe you couldn't finish off a young girl...I wonder if you felt sympathy for her. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Kindness doesn't suit you. It's not very monster-like, Dracul. 
 
**Mash:**
Dracul...no way. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Vlad III...Romania's greatest hero. Also known as the Lord Impaler. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Who knew that you'd reveal my True Name in front of others. I'm extremely displeased. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
What's wrong? I would rather be remembered by a bad name than not at all. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Besides...I prefer to be called by my True Name. Dread and despair, faintly spiced with hope. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
The ones with the best cries are the little squirrels who think "I can escape. "
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
But in the end, you were driven to ruin by the hands of those who actually escaped. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Elisabeth Báthory. Otherwise known as Carmilla. How humorous your tragic end was. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
How boring. That's why I don't like your kind. Even as you're damned as a vampire, you still cling to your noble "heart. "
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
&mdash;You mean to say that I cling to my faith even now? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Stop this instant. I told you that you could devour freely,but do not forget who is friend and foe. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Turn your animosity to those little girls now. Save your petty squabbles for later. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Ah, you misunderstand, Master. Secretly, I idolize Count Vlad as a leader. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
That's the first I've heard of it. Comparing idolizing with plotting assassination. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow...They're fighting amongst themselves...It's a bad work environment, over there. 
 
**Mash:**
Do not let your guard down, Master. They still intend to kill us! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
All right, it's my turn. Please don't mistake me for that kind Count Vlad. 
 
**Mash:**
Master...Elisabeth Báthory.... Do you know her? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Blood Countess, was it? 
 
**Mash:**
That's right. Like Vlad III, she was feared as a monster&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
She believed that bathing in the blood of virgins would keep her youthful. She's said to have murdered hundreds of girls. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Never heard of her. 
 
**Mash:**
She was a Hungarian noble, who was said to have abducted and slaughtered young girls. 
 
**Mash:**
She believed bathing in their blood would make her skin youthful again. 
 

---

 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Saints' blood is valuable. No woman would let go of a gem placed before her! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Something doesn't feel right. Was that the reason Count Vlad...
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
You over there, young lady. You&mdash;smell horrible. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
A girl of such tender years, yet so battle-hardened. How contradictory. Who is she? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...A Demi-Servant. An anomaly, a cross between a human and a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...That was my mistake. You two are crueler than the others, but that's why you're so playful. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Let the remaining three deal with this girl. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Wait, Carmilla and I can still fight. The saint's blood belongs to us. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
As if I would allow mere executioners who know nothing of the radiance of blood, the grandeur of blood, take...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Shut up. Know your place, Vlad III. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
No matter how much authority you may have had in life, you're all equals as Servants. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You wanted so badly to suck her blood that you unconsciously held back. You haven't learned a thing. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;I hate people like that. Stay out of it this time, okay? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Mash, run! I'll hold her off! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh no, is she sending those three after us now? What do we do? Any ideas? Any ideas? 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, please calm down. You're starting to make me panic, too! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
B-But this is really bad, right! Okay, where's my email? I need the internet's help! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Off to the internet idol page! Help me Magi☆Mari! Help me Magi☆Mari! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"We're being attacked by three Servants. What should we do? " Okay, sent. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"I guess you'll have to just die and be reborn! ☆"
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow, internet idols are HARSH! She doesn't know how I feel! 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Master, I'm going to try and break through. 
 
**Mash:**
Stay close! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Ugh! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That should be enough. Just in case, I will make sure to remove your head from your body. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Both of you, please go! 
 
**Jeanne:**
What? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;What? 
 
**Mash:**
A glass&ndash;rose? 
 
**F：???:**
&ndash;It's not elegant. 
 
**F：???:**
Neither is this city. Neither is that combat style. I don't like your philosophy or principles either. 
 
**F：???:**
You're so beautiful, yet you shroud yourself in blood and hatred. 
 
**F：???:**
For good or for evil, shouldn't a human try to be more free? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...A Servant? 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**F：???:**
Yes, that's right. I'm so happy. This is what it means to announce oneself as a hero of justice! 
 
**F：???:**
I know who you are. I also know how powerful and terrifying you are. 
 
**F：???:**
To be honest, I have to confess that I've never trembled in fear more before anyone else. 
 
**F：???:**
Yet still&mdash;If you intend to invade this nation, then I shall face you even if I have to tear apart my dress. 
 
**F：???:**
Why? Because...
 
**Berserk Saber:**
You are...
 
**F：???:**
Oh my. So you know my True Name. Have we met before, splendid female knight? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Saber. Who is she? 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;Answer me. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
I can tell who she is, even with this murderous rage burning in my heart. Her beauty is unmistakable. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
The girl they called the Flower of Versailles. She is&mdash;Marie Antoinette. 
 
**Mash:**
Queen Marie Antoinette? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's right! Thank you for saying my name! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And as long as that name exists, I will play my role, no matter how foolish it may be. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You! Dragon Witch who's torching my country. It might be pointless, but I will ask you anyway. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Are you evil enough to perform your wicked deeds in my very presence? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Will you declare yourself a greater fool than I, the queen who failed to stop the revolution? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Silence! You lack the right to participate in this battle. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, and why is that? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You led a life of luxury in a palace, and died without even knowing what happened. Are you saying you can understand our hatred? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hmm...I suppose I can't. But that just makes me want to know more, Dragon Witch. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...What? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
What I don't know, I learn. That's my policy. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's why I can't bear to look at you like this. Oh, Jeanne d'Arc, beloved saint! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
All I know is that you're taking your rage out on the innocent. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And I've not the slightest idea why. Everything's disappearing into a haze, like a girl going for a Sunday walk. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I've no words for you. What I do know is this. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Along with the Jeanne d'Arc over there. I am going to make your heart and body mine! 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Uh...huh? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, my. Oh dear, oh dear. Um, don't misunderstand me. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I just meant that as a Queen, I'm going to bring you to your knees. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...It's falling apart...My image of Marie Antoinette is falling apart...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;Enough of this farce. Very well then, you are my enemy. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Servants, first take care of that annoying princess! Then the others! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne:**
We survived somehow. So did she! 
 
**Mash:**
Gasp...gasp...gasp...
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Damn, so irritating! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, that's right. This is a battlefield, after all. That's enough talk. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You're the enemy of the world, aren't you? So first&ndash;We must appease the souls of all those you murdered. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Thank you for waiting, Amadeus. Crush them like bugs! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Leave it to me! Noble Phantasm, "Requiem for Death. "
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
One more! Oh, but what a glorious, evil sound! 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Ugh, such pressure! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Damn! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Now then, good day everyone. Au revoir! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Hmph. Rider! 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
...What is it? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Go after them. Surely you can catch them on your "horse. "
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
There's no need to fight. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Just tell me where they are, and I'll crush them. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
...Understood. I assure you I'll catch them. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Ahh, that awful noise is gone...What a shame. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
I wonder if I can make that Servant my pet. I'd stick his head on a phonograph and have him scream all night. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
...Ruler. Do you think Rider alone is enough to handle them? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It will be fine. Rider's Noble Phantasm is perfect for destroying them. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...But you're right, I should be careful. I'll return and prepare to summon additional Servants. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Go ahead and cause as much trouble as you like. If you're lucky enough to find them, slay them. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You're not going to be beaten by an queen who never left her castle, are you? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
How harsh. I stayed in a castle too. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
But...Heh. My talents are a match for any of the others. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Saber, Lancer. The next time we fight, will you let me handle the enemy Rider? 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
May I ask why? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
She is the person I wish to slaughter most in this world. It will be that woman Marie who kneels before me. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
...
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Oh, Saber. Is there something you'd like to add? 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
You're right. There's no point in me worrying about your sense of inferiority towards her. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
&ndash;What did you say? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Stop. I don't care. It doesn't matter who beats who, the result doesn't change. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I leave this in your hands. Don't get too out of control. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Even Anti-Heroes have their dignity. Make sure you don't become mere murderers. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
...She flew off, huh? "Dragon Witch" is certainly the right word for her. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
&ndash;The woman we just faced was the real Jeanne d'Arc, wasn't she? 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
What of it? Ours isn't a fake either. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
And we are Servants, in search of blood. &ndash;Though you may not be, even in this state...
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Chevalier d'Eon. The noble dragoon. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
...I will obey my Master. If she wishes to end the world, I will help her. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
And I too, am under Madness Enhancement. Do not anger me. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
&ndash;Heh. My apologies. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
...
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
It's hard not to feel pity. The Queen they respected, who sent them a dress, is now her enemy. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
But that is the fate of a Servant. That is the nature of the Holy Grail War. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Lancer, let's go. We must search the next city. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
We are vampires, who must drink the blood of the living. Finding our next meal is a matter of life and death. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
...Indeed, none of these meals are satisfactory. But I'll take what I can get. 
 
## Section 6: One Thing After Another 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;Phew. All right, are we safe now? 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. I'm not detecting them anymore. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
While we're at it, I'm picking up leyline readings from that nearby forest. 
 
**Mash:**
Very well. Jeanne? And...Marie? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Marie, did you say? 
 
**Mash:**
F-Forgive me. Um&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You weren't being rude! You made me so happy! The way you addressed me was so adorable! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Please, splendid foreigner! Would you mind calling me that from now on? 
 
**Mash:**
Uh, yes...Miss Marie, or Mademoiselle Marie, perhaps? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Nope, that won't work at all. Just Marie! Like the sheep! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm pretty sure that was 'Mary'...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nice to meet you, Marie. 
 

---

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Nice to meet you! I'm Marie! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I love understanding {(M) gentlemen /(F) ladies}. Let me guess. You're very popular with the opposite sex, right? 
 
**Mash:**
...Marie, may I speak? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, my apologies. I got excited for a minute. How rude of me. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So, how may I be of service? 
 
**Mash:**
A strong leyline was detected in a nearby forest. I'd like to head there and make camp...
 
**Mash:**
Is that all right, everyone? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Of course, that's fine. Is that all right with you, Amadeus? 
 
**Amadeus:**
There's no point in asking for my opinion. Do what you want, Maria. 
 
**Jeanne:**
All right. It should be fine, I think. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's go there and rest, and then we can talk about our next move. 
 
**Mash:**
...Looks like some monsters have found the leyline too. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's get rid of them! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Now I will establish a summoning circle. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey guys, are you enjoying your trip through 15th century France? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now then, let's get today's lecture started. Today I'll be talking about Servant categories. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Most of the Servants that can be summoned are divided into seven classes. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, Assassin. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Each class has various compatibilities. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Saber has the advantage over Lancer, for instance. And Lancer over Archer, and Archer over Saber. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Rider over Caster, Caster over Assassin, and Assassin over Rider. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
And Berserker is strong against all classes, but weak when attacked. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's like a game of rock, paper, scissors. Keep this in mind when fighting the enemy. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course, there are some Servants who don't fall into these categories. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll explain them another time. Okay, circle's good to go. Have a nice journey! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Now that things have settled down, I'd like to introduce myself again. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
My True Name is Marie Antoinette. I'm from the Rider Class. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
As for who I am, I'd be happy if you could examine me closely with your eyes and ears. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
As for why I was summoned, unfortunately,I have no idea. After all, I have no Master. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. I'm the same as her. 
 
**Amadeus:**
As for why I was summoned, first of all, it just doesn't feel like I'm a hero. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Yes I'm great, but even so, I'm still just one of many artists...
 
**Amadeus:**
Well, I did apply magecraft in my music, but that was only because I was drawn to the sounds played by demons. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm Mash Kyrielight. I'm a Demi-Servant, and I don't know what my True Name is. 
 
**Mash:**
This is Fujimaru. My Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice to meet you. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Pleasure is mine. As fellow non-fighters, let's get along. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whassup. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh my! What an interesting greeting! Wh...Whassup! My homies! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hmph, it seems different when Fujimaru says it...Perhaps I need to think more like a peasant...
 
**Mash:**
Come on...Don't teach her weird greetings. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, I've got it! I have to be more needy! Come on, Amadeus! Whassup! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Whassup! I like it, Maria. Keep it up! I can feel the love of a century beginning to fade! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Hmmph. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'm sorry Fujimaru. Whassup is a very stimulating greeting, but I must reluctantly refrain from it. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If Amadeus likes it, that means it's not appropriate for a lady to use. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Let's not be slanderous here. You're acting like I'm a pervert gentleman who loves dirty jokes. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Don't blame me. You're a child when it comes to everything but music. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
And this is&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Jeanne. Jeanne d'Arc, yes? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
The saint who saved France. One of the people I wished to meet in my life. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...I'm, not a saint. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, everyone knows that's how you saw yourself. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But the way you lead your life was true, and we all know the results. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's why everyone will always remember and admire the name Jeanne d'Arc, and the miracle of Orleans. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Amadeus:**
Of course, your life ended at the stake and resulted in that witch. It's just like Maria to only look at the good parts. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Am I wrong, Jeanne d'Arc? Your life was a little out of tune. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Jeanne herself is the one who gets hurt when people call her a perfect saint. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Listen, Maria. You always say what you think others want to hear. Sometimes you need to scold or deny others. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I-I don't need to hear that from you, Amadeus! You already tell me that every day! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
T-This is what you want, right? You piano-brain! Piece of human garbage! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You're a pervert who can only get it up for musical scales! If you like music so much, you should turn into a piano! 
 
**Amadeus:**
...I don't know if I should say this, but when you insult me like that, I feel something indescribable. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But see? You can do it if you try! Give the same treatment to Jeanne. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Faster. Stronger. More violent! Tell her all of her flaws as you see them! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Non, that's impossible Amadeus. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Human garbage like you has nothing but flaws. But Jeanne herself has none. 
 
**Amadeus:**
&mdash;Are you serious? I didn't know you had it that bad. You really did love Jeanne d'Arc, didn't you? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I would say "worship" rather than love. And a bit of guilt, as well. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...A tiny "sorry", the size of a teaspoon. The natural guilt we foolish royals feel towards the Saint. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Marie Antoinette. Your words honor me, but that's why I must confess. 
 
**Jeanne:**
In life, I was no saint. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I held the flag high for what I believed in, and as a result, I stained my hands with blood. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Of course, I don't regret that. Nor do I regret the Inquisition&ndash;Or my own death. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But I shed too much blood. I believed in the dreams of a little country girl, but&mdash;
 
**Jeanne:**
At the time, I never imagined how high the price of that dream was. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I never regretted it, but never did I feel fear.... And that is my greatest sin. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Only the outcome of my actions made me a saint. I do not think it's the right word for a country girl like me. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...I see. So you're not a saint, right? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Then, may I call you Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Y-Yes. Of course. It feels like that would bring back old memories. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Wonderful. Call me Marie, then. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If you're simply Jeanne, and not a saint, then I want to be Marie, and not a queen. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Please Jeanne, will you call me Marie? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Y-Yes. All right...Thank you, Marie. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Thank you too. I am happy, Jeanne! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And I'm sorry. I keep pushing my own views on you. You've lost your own answers about yourself, haven't you? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Just like the day I died, not knowing a thing about what was going on. You'll have to find your own answers. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I certainly want to treat you as a saint, but I'll stop myself! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I won't just believe in you, I'll support you! Isn't that what female friends are supposed to do, Amadeus? 
 
**Amadeus:**
I suppose so, yeah? You guys can go eat sweets or something. 
 
**Mash:**
We believe in you too. Right, Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Heh, heh, thank you. That makes me feel better. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fake monsters are a common thing. 
 
**Jeanne:**
F-Fake monsters? 
 
**Mash:**
Master...Don't say things that are going to confuse her. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I don't know about fake monsters, but I do know about monsters! 
 

---

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Look, it seems like we have invited some unwanted guests. 
 
**Amadeus:**
No, I don't think you invited them. Well, whatever. Let's get rid of them and resume our conversation! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;Now I understand. The whole world, never mind France, is in danger. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Although it's in a different form, this too, is a Holy Grail War? 
 
**Amadeus:**
I knew it was dangerous when I learned it was a Master-less summoning, but I didn't expect this. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Now there were five Servants in opposition. Nine total including Mash, but isn't that too much? 
 
**Mash:**
The rule of seven Servants is no more.... Although that doesn't mean infinite. 
 
**Mash:**
It's not surprising at all if there are more than seven Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
...According to the records, one time a total of fifteen Servants fought. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, I get it! I've figured it out, everyone! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
We were summoned so that&ndash;We could defeat them, like heroes! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It might be to destroy the world. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Non, non, non! That's not right, Fujimaru. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I love everybody. Just as I did when I was alive. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I wouldn't need these feelings to destroy the world, and they wouldn't summon me anyway! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think you're right. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, yes! I finally feel like I've found my job in life! 
 

---

 
**Amadeus:**
It's perfectly fine to be confident, Maria. But we're up against powerful foes. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Jeanne and Mash, as well as Fujimaru, are used to combat. But you and I aren't the fighting type. 
 
**Amadeus:**
The numbers matter less than the fact that they're far stronger. 
 
**Mash:**
...Indeed. Vlad III, and Elisabeth Báthory. 
 
**Mash:**
One carved their name into history as a hero, and the other, a murderess...
 
**Mash:**
The other that looked like a Saber seemed to know Marie...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...That's right. If she knows who I am, then...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Perhaps she's Chevalier d'Eon? I've no proof, though. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chevalier d'Eon...A spy with Louis XV's intelligence agency, the Secret du Roi. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She was also a Dragoon, and a plenipotentiary minister...She, no, maybe he? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It matters little, mage from a distant world. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
She was summoned from a different time than me, but her splendid face hasn't changed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see...It would be wonderful if she would join us...
 
**Jeanne:**
That might be difficult, I think. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I've lost my Ruler's ability to see True Names, but there is one thing I could see. 
 
**Jeanne:**
All of them have been given "Madness Enhancement," regardless of their alignment or background. 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's probably the power of the Grail. Even without an episode of madness, it can give them Berserker traits...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hmph. The goal of a Holy Grail War is to get the Grail, but they already have it. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's not fair! 
 
**Jeanne:**
But that leaves one mystery. Why were you summoned? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...This is just a theory. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Despite the fact that the Holy Grail War hasn't begun, someone already has the Grail. 
 
**Jeanne:**
This is a reversal of causality. A bug, if you will,and perhaps the Grail is resisting it. 
 
**Jeanne:**
The greater the opponent, the more powerful the Grail's reaction. 
 
**Mash:**
...I see. In other words, somewhere else in France&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
Indeed. There may be other Servants summoned here like Marie. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh my! That means I can meet even more people, right? 
 
**Amadeus:**
That's not necessarily a good thing. It may just mean more enemies. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But whichever it is, we should start searching for them as soon as we can. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Before the other Jeanne finds them. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Indeed. I've lost my ability to detect Servants. 
 
**Jeanne:**
So we'll have to depend on Mr. Roman. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sure thing. I can't match a full-powered Ruler,but I can search farther than a Servant. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Let's take a little break first! You're all tired, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes Master, rest for a bit. We'll stand watch. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
I'm going to patrol the area. Jeanne, please wait here. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Is something wrong, Jeanne? You seem defeated...Are you tired? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Marie...No, I'm not tired. I am a Servant, after all. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Perhaps you're saddened by the state France is in...I mean, are you disappointed? 
 
**Jeanne:**
No, I'm not disappointed. Thank you for your concern, Marie. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But...Seeing those familiar towns in flames is a bit hard to bear. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes...For you, especially, this era is exactly like it was when you were alive. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's different than what I feel inside...Memories that are still going on. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes! Why don't we take this time to talk? Girls' night out! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Excuse me? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, is that strange? But both you and I were summoned in the bloom of our youth. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You see? I'm in the middle of puberty, right? So I love talking about love and romance! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Ahaha...I appreciate the offer, but that's hard for me. I know of compassion, but not romance. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But...You're missing out on life! It's not too late to start! Fall in love with someone, Jeanne! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Of course, if I get the chance. Have you fallen in love, Marie? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Heheh, of course. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I fell in love with a boy who proposed to me at age 7. I think it was my first love. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And when I was 14, I fell in love with the king I married. 
 
**Jeanne:**
14! That's kind of amazing. 
 
**Jeanne:**
When I was that age...I was working and playing in the fields with the other children. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That sounds fun, too! I'm jealous. It must be such fun to be able to go wherever you want! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, it was fun. What I lacked in romance, I made up for in friendship. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Did all the boys like you? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Hmm, my hair was short then, so they treated me like one of the guys&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, I'm so glad I became a Servant! I can't believe I'm having girl talk with Jeanne d'Arc. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's good to be a queen! 
 
**Jeanne:**
The honor is mine. Who would've thought that I get to talk to the famous Marie Antoinette. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It's good to be a Servant. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'm just glad that this isn't a real Holy Grail War. Otherwise, we couldn't chat like this&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
...Marie. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, both of you. It appears to be an enemy attack! 
 
**Jeanne:**
I knew it. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh my. 
 
**Mash:**
I'll go wake up Master! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Come Jeanne, let us fight like proper Servants. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Bravely, gallantly, whole-heartedly, and yet beautifully, like a maiden in love. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's what you and I are at our core. Neither saints, nor queens. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...The way I fight has little to do with beauty and elegance, I'm afraid. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, your orders! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Come, Fujimaru. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'll show you the power that I couldn't show you before! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&mdash;Tomboy princess, coming through! I'll dance brilliantly, like glasswork! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servants detected! Also, multiple life-forms detected! 
 
**Mash:**
...Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for battle! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 
**Amadeus:**
What a drag. I've detected it, too. Having good hearing isn't always a good thing. 
 
**Amadeus:**
In fact, I hate this sound so much it makes me want to scream. 
 
**Amadeus:**
The sound of an enemy's footstep, is worse than a high-pitched trumpet. 
 
**Mash:**
You can hear them at this distance? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Of course. I became a Servant because of my music. I can detect any sound wave in the air. 
 
**Amadeus:**
For instance, the sound of you and Maria's sleeping when we were camping. I enjoyed listening to them both. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But, not just the sound of you sleeping. I've recorded all the tiny sounds your body makes in my Wolfgang Recorder! 
 
**Mash:**
!!! A-A sexually harassing Servant! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'm sorry, Mash. As his keeper, I apologize. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But bear with him a little. Without his ears, he's nothing more than a pervert! 
 
**Amadeus:**
What are you saying? Human beings create filth just by living! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Only by realizing that can you create true music. Life is filth, and music cleanses it. 
 
**Amadeus:**
&mdash;Now then, I hear footsteps, and drawn swords. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Naught but boorish noise. I don't write my music for fools, but&ndash;
 
**Amadeus:**
You've come all this way. I shall play my Requiem of Death for you! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
All that's left are the Servants! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Is everybody all right? Does anyone need healing? 
 
**Jeanne:**
We're good here. What about you, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
I'm fine. Doctor, are they here yet? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;They're coming. Are you ready? 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
...Hello, everybody. What a lonely night. 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Who are you? 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
Who? Let's see, I wonder who I am. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
I forced myself to be a righteous saint, but in this world I'm a slave to a broken one. 
 
**Jeanne:**
A broken saint...
 
**Berserk Rider:**
Yes, thanks to her, my reason has left and I've gone mad. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
I am doing everything I can to hold myself back. What a mess this is. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
So while I appreciate your hopes, I cannot join you. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
You don't want a Servant who'll stab you from behind at every single opportunity, do you? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Then why did you come here? 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
...My task was to observe you, but my waning reason whispers that I should test you. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
You face the Dragon Witch. Disaster incarnate, riding on the "ultimate dragon. "
 
**Berserk Rider:**
If you cannot surpass me, you will never defeat her. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
Defeat me. Plunge your blade into my heart without hesitation. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
My True Name is Martha. Now come to me, Iron Dragon Tarasque! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Martha...Saint Martha? Watch out, everyone! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She once defeated a dragon with nothing but prayers! If she's a Servant, that means&ndash;
 
**Berserk Rider:**
Let us see if you are capable of slaying me&ndash;! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's a dragon rider! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Berserk Rider:**
...I see. That's enough. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Martha. Did you&ndash;
 
**Berserk Rider:**
Hold back? Of course not. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
This is fine, it's fine this way. Seriously, don't make a saint massacre you! 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
...Listen, let me tell you one last thing. You'll never beat the dragon controlled by the Dragon Witch. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
There's only one way to surpass that type of dragon. Go to Lyon...the city once known as Lyon. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
It won't be a saint who defeats the dragon, nor a princess. Ever since ancient times, only a "Dragon Slayer" is capable of killing a dragon. 
 
**Berserk Rider:**
Tarasque, I'm sorry.... Next time, I hope I'll be summoned properly. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Even Saint Martha can't resist her. 
 
**Mash:**
She'd undergone Madness Enhancement, in addition to being summoned. Perhaps it can't be helped. 
 
**Mash:**
Normally it would be impossible to even talk to her. 
 
**Mash:**
The only reason we were able to communicate was because of her incredible self-control. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. She was a peaceful, yet fierce as a person. I could tell. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
She is the Iron Saint. She is a woman like adamantite,who solves things with her fists in the end. 
 
**Amadeus:**
They say she defeated the Tarasque with a sermon, but I bet she just beat it up. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Anyway, thanks to her, we know where we're going. 
 
**Amadeus:**
We should hurry, right? Let's get going to Lyon. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm surprised. Amadeus seemed like, um, the type of person who'd hate to travel on foot...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh no, Amadeus loves traveling. He's traveled to many places ever since he was a child. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Well, I suppose it's true that I'm used to traveling. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hehe, I'm getting excited. I wonder what, and who, waits for us in Lyon! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Come on, Jeanne. Let's get going. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Right! 
 
## Section 7: Search for the Dragon Slayer 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Did Rider commit suicide? It's troublesome that she retained her sanity even with Madness Enhancement. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Still, she likely fought with all of her might. If that's the case, we can't let our guard down. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Next time, "he" and I will mobilize. I'm also taking the Servants summoned today. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Please contact the Berserk Assassin. 
 
**Gilles:**
Understood. If I were who I was before, I would've stopped you. 
 
**Gilles:**
But now, you're perfect Jeanne! You don't even need luck! 
 
**Gilles:**
Please trample over them as much as you wish. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Gilles. Which do you think is the real one? Me, or her? 
 
**Gilles:**
Of course it's you. Are you listening, Jeanne? 
 
**Gilles:**
You were burned at the stake. Betrayed, by everyone! 
 
**Gilles:**
Charles VII left you to die, because he didn't want to pay the ransom! 
 
**Gilles:**
Not a single person rose to bravely fight for your return! 
 
**Gilles:**
And what was the cause of all this? It was God! It was our God, mocking us! 
 
**Gilles:**
Thus, we deny God. Don't we, Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Yes. Yes you're right, Gilles. I have nothing left. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
My soldiers are gone, and my admirers fled. The king betrayed me and the bishop burnt me in the name of God. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;I was wrong. No, everything was wrong. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Not just what I believed in. The very country that allowed me to exist was wrong. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
This mistake must be righted. Jeanne d'Arc was a mistake. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So let us do as they decided, and make it all so it never happened. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
My salvation of the country was itself a fatal mistake. 
 
**Gilles:**
...Jeanne. Please, don't put yourself under such stress. 
 
**Gilles:**
This is a divine punishment. Nothing more. Your revenge is righteous. What you saved, you may destroy. 
 
**Gilles:**
Isn't that all there is to it? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...You're right, Gilles. What you say is extreme, but it brings me strength. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Let's go, Berserker, Assassin...This is getting complicated. May I use your True Names? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Lancelot, Knight of the Lake; and the Executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Mount your wyverns. I shall lead you. 
 
**Lancelot:**
&mdash;Urrrrrr. 
 
**Sanson:**
...Of course, Master. Only I am fit to take the head of the Queen. 
 
**Citizen:**
...And that's what happened...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I see, I see! Understood. How interesting. How very interesting! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Thank you, kind sir. Farewell, until we meet again! 
 
**Citizen:**
Y-Yes ma'am! Um, by the way, you seem to be of noble birth. What is your name&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
My name is Marie Antoinette! Hehe, it might be worth remembering. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Keep passing it down for 360 years or so, and someone might be in for a surprise, hehe. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Guys! I got the information! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Sorry, Marie. I will cause a panic if I go into town...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Don't worry, Jeanne. We're both Servants, you know. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Now, I've got some great information. The city St. Martha told us of, Lyon. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
To put it simply, Lyon was destroyed a little while ago. Its refugees have settled here. 
 
**Jeanne:**
The "used to be" nuance interests me.... So it's just as I thought? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. The town is filled with monsters that seem to have risen from the depths of Hell. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But I think what came before that is the important part. They said Lyon had a protector. 
 
**Mash:**
A protector? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
A knight with a large sword, who defeated wyverns and skeletons. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I see. Perhaps that's the Servant Martha spoke of before. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. But a little while ago, some scary people came. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Servants, probably. He was overwhelmed by their numbers and is now missing. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And so Lyon was destroyed...
 
**Mash:**
I hope he's alive...No, let's believe in the words of St. Martha. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, right. Charles VII visited the village and General Gilles de Rais marshalled the routed soldiers, they said. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
He's attempting to attack Lyon and take back the city. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure it would be...difficult to meet with him. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Why is that? Gilles de Rais is an admirer of Jeanne, right? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If Jeanne asks, he's sure to lend a helping hand? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...That's precisely the reason. He knows that I've become the Dragon Witch. 
 
**Jeanne:**
He wouldn't accept me like that. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...I see. I'm not sure if that's quite right. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But I understand that you might not want to see him! You're a girl, after all. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, I agree we don't need to see him! We're in a hurry, after all. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I don't think normal soldiers can handle all those monsters in Lyon, anyway...
 
**Jeanne:**
...You're quite right. Let's defeat them on our own. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We can do it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No problem. 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Fujimaru...You're right. This is nothing. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, that's what it means to be a {(M) boy /(F) commander}! Here's your reward! 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Well? Was it good? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai...You have a goofy grin on your face. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Master, hang in there.... Jeez! 
 

---

 
**Amadeus:**
She finally went and did it, huh? Sorry, just ignore that. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Maria has a bad habit of kissing everything. It caused chaos in the palace. 
 
**Amadeus:**
There were actually factions formed of people she'd kissed and people she hadn't. 
 
**Amadeus:**
No playwright would touch a story about a court that almost destroyed itself before the revolution. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, come on. Snap out of it. Snap out of it! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Huh? You guys don't do kisses? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Maybe like when your heart feels like someone's squeezing it...You do it too, right Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I-I do not! I do not! Only with someone I was going to marry&mdash;
 
**Amadeus:**
...Huh? Hey, hold on a second. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Those soldiers over there seem ready to kill. I don't think they're back from the front. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Seems like they've become bandits. This tragedy is enough to shatter anyone's mind. 
 
**Jeanne:**
We cannot let the townspeople suffer. Let us capture them. 
 
**Mash:**
Got it. Back of the blade it is! 
 
**Amadeus:**
...But that's a shield right? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We've tied up the bandits, let's hand them to the town's people. I think we can leave the rest to them. 
 
**Mash:**
All right, let's head out everybody! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
We're almost there, don't you think? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, we should be. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...The thought of having to see a ruined town again, is heartbreaking. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...There's no one here. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, any signs of life&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor? 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry. Reception's not very good here. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's split up and search for that "Dragon Slayer" Martha mentioned. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Right. Let's see which of us finds that person first. Amadeus and I will take the west side. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Then Mash and I will take the east. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. Let's go, Master! 
 
**Jeanne:**
This was once a beautiful town. Why would that Dragon Witch do this&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's a fake. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not you. 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
That'd be nice, but...Huh? Did I just hear a voice? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, faintly. It may be a survivor. Let's go check it out. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Ugh! 
 
**Mash:**
Living Dead! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Turning the townsfolk into monsters...This is beyond heresy! 
 
**Mash:**
We can't save them anymore...Ready for battle, Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rest in peace. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be at peace. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Even more enemies! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, just as I thought! I hurried back, but they're swarming over here too! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You may not need any help, but I can't just sit around! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I will help you, Fujimaru! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne:**
Wyvern! 
 
**Amadeus:**
What? I am tired of seeing them. They are no more than third-rate instruments, time to get rid of them! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne:**
Phew! Enemies eliminated. May their souls rest in peace&ndash;
 
**G：???:**
Peace...Do they desire peace? That is such a foolish thing to say. 
 
**G：???:**
They have no peace in their souls. There is certainly none residing in us Servants&ndash;
 
**G：???:**
This world has been frozen for years...
 
**Mash:**
...Servant! 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Who are you? 
 
**Phantom:**
Correct. People call me&ndash;The Phantom of the Opera. 
 
**Phantom:**
By order of the "Dragon Witch,"this town is under my absolute control. 
 
**Phantom:**
Now, now, now. This is the middle of Hell, where the dead live. 
 
**Phantom:**
&ndash;What are you going to do? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll send you flying. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll crush you. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Just like that, Master! Here we go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Phantom:**
Ugh! Still, my mission is accomplished. Though I shall never be rewarded, never. 
 
**Phantom:**
This is where my song ends, but the real Hell starts now. 
 
**Phantom:**
Rejoice, oh Holy Maiden! Your evil has grown even more than you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Be silent. It must be hard to even talk now. 
 
**Phantom:**
These are not words. This is a song. To lament your future, and to mourn it. 
 
**Phantom:**
Forget about the Dragon Slayer...Run to the ends of the earth. 
 
**Phantom:**
If lady luck is on your side&ndash;you might just have a chance to escape. 
 
**Phantom:**
Here it comes. The Dragon is here. The Devil is here. An evil dragon unlike any of you have seen before. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You're a stubborn one, aren't you? The coda has ended, now back to hell with you. 
 
**Mash:**
An evil...dragon? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Finally, I got through to you! Everyone, I recommend that we evacuate! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This reading is way beyond a Servant&ndash;It's indicating an "ultra-size lifeform. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's approaching with incredible speed! 
 
**Mash:**
...Beyond a Servant! Can such a lifeform even exist in this world? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course they can! The world's a big place! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, sorry. Save the chatter for later! I am also detecting 3 Servants heading this way. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...It must be them. This is quite a problem. 
 
**Amadeus:**
The orchestra is done. Let's get out of here. I know we just wasted our effort, but that's life. 
 
**Mash:**
But...Wait, please. 
 
**Mash:**
If the reading is truly beyond that of a Servant, then we need the "Dragon Slayer" more than ever. 
 
**Mash:**
That person must be in this town, right? We can at least look for that Servant&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, no, no. No time, no time! 
 
**Jeanne:**
But if we abandon that Servant now, we may never get another chance! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, your orders! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Find the "Dragon Slayer". 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If we run here, things will get worse. Let's fight! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Understood! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Amadeus, let's prepare for battle.... Will you fight with me? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Didn't you just order me to fight? You just need to stand proudly, and smile as always. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Don't worry yourself over me. If things get bad, I'll run away on my own! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. That's the Amadeus I know. It's okay, we just have to buy some time. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I won't die. Not here, at least. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Are you detecting any other Servants? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Searching now. Hang on a moment! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;Right. There's a faint reading from the castle up ahead! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let's go! 
 
## Section 8: Attack of the Giant Dragon 
 
**Mash:**
...There you are! 
 
**Jeanne:**
What a terrible wound! 
 
**G：???:**
...Ugh! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh! 
 
**G：???:**
One after...Another. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Please wait! We are on your side! At least, we have no intention of causing you harm! 
 
**G：???:**
???
 
**Mash:**
At any rate, please hurry! A dragon is approaching! 
 
**Mash:**
Several Servants are with it, as well. We are at an overwhelming disadvantage here&ndash;
 
**G：???:**
A dragon, huh......I see. 
 
**G：???:**
That's why I was summoned and then attacked. 
 
**Mash:**
We will help you, let's get out of here! 
 
**G：???:**
I'm sorry, I owe you one! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hurry, Fujimaru! Even we can sense it approaching! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's within plain sight now! This is...No, it can't be! 
 
**Mash:**
Wyverns can't compare to that thing. That's a real dragon! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I was wondering what you found, turns out it's just another dying Servant. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Very well, you can all die together! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's attacking! 
 
**Amadeus:**
No, get back, Maria! Your Noble Phantasm is useless here! 
 
**Mash:**
I-I am going out! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't be ridiculous! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you saying? 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Mash, we'll do it together! 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Incinerate them...Fafnir! 
 
**Jeanne:**
"Luminosite&ndash;"
 
**Mash:**
Deploying Virtual Noble Phantasm! 
 
**Jeanne:**
"Eternelle!! "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Kya! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa! What an immense amount of energy! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You all right!? Can you hear me? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...S-Say something! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just shut up! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please stop talking! 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Ugh! Just as I thought, this is...
 
**Mash:**
I can't hold on anymore, it's no use! 
 
**G：???:**
&ndash;No, looks like you made it. Thanks to you, my power's restored for a little. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Huh? 
 
**G：???:**
&ndash;It's been a while Evil Dragon Fafnir. If you've resurrected, I will send you back to your slumber...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Fafnir is trembling...That Servant, could it be&ndash;? 
 
**Siegfried:**
Hear me, One Who Rules the Blue Sky! My name is Siegfried! He who once defeated thee! 
 
**Siegfried:**
Noble Phantasm, Release! "Bal&ndash;mung! "
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Dammit! Fafnir, climb up now! 
 
**Siegfried:**
...(pant, pant, pant)Sorry, this is the best I can do. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Get out of there, before they come back...
 
**Jeanne:**
Everyone, let's retreat while we can! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's dangerous. Considering what's to come,I can't exhaust Fafnir. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...If they use that sword again it may be a problem. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserker, Saber. That "Dragon Slayer" is the prize. Concentrate on getting him. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Berserk Assassin will be joining us soon. This time, finish them off for good. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am not detecting the ultra-size lifeform anymore. But the enemies are still on our tails, hurry! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I want a horse! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Sorry, this is a one-seater! 
 
**Amadeus:**
I'm used to traveling, but this is a first for me! This is just us retreating, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Master, don't fall behind! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, but my leg...
 
**Mash:**
In that case, well! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's fight back. 
 
**Mash:**
I suppose so, in that case...
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Wait, please. I see something up ahead. That's the...French army! 
 
**Jeanne:**
They're being attacked by the wyverns! We need to go help them! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, here they come! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready to fight back! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll just have to do it! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai! In for a penny, in for a pound! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
There are zombies heading this way, too. No problem, we'll just fight it out! 
 
**Mash:**
Let's keep this battle going, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
I've disposed of the first wave of wyverns. Next up...
 
**G：???:**
A&mdash;Urrrrr! 
 
**H：???:**
...
 
**Amadeus:**
...Damn you! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;My, what a coincidence. I've never forgotten your face, you lazy artisan. 
 
**H：???:**
That's good to hear. I've never forgotten yours either. Your face, and your pale white neck. 
 
**H：???:**
At the same time, I feel like this is destiny. That you and I share a special connection. 
 
**H：???:**
Don't we? The fate of a executioner killing the same person twice, I feel like only we share that kind of connection. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Not only in life, but even now you're eager to execute Maria? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Charles-Henri Sanson. Could it be that you are genuinely mad? 
 
**Sanson:**
...As a human, it pains me to discuss our relationship with a low-life like you. 
 
**Sanson:**
Amadeus, you claimed all lives, all humans, are filthy. Not I. Humans are sacred, precious things. 
 
**Sanson:**
That's why we executioners respect life. We are incompatible, you and I. 
 
**Sanson:**
Trash who couldn't even love humans, trash who couldn't understand her, has no right to be next to her. 
 
**G：???:**
...Arrrrrrrrrrr! 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh! 
 
**Mash:**
What an attack! Master, please stand back! 
 
**Mash:**
This Berserker...He's much more frightening than any Servant we've faced so far! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Look at the sky! Look how many wyverns are in flight! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Ugh! I'm going to help the French army! You two, take care of that Servant! 
 
**Sanson:**
My sword of execution is pure. 
 
**Sanson:**
It's not for the likes of you who do not submit to death, but...
 
**Sanson:**
Thinking of it, this entire nation is an execution site. Now, I shall remove your head with one strike! 
 
**???:**
Arrrrrrrrrrrrr! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**???:**
...Arrrrrrrrrr! 
 
**Sanson:**
...Damn. What is with that Servant? I mean, that's beyond indestructible! 
 
**Mash:**
Haaa...Ugh! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Sanson...What's the meaning of this...
 
**Amadeus:**
Dammit, now there are more wyverns, too! If only they'd focus on that crazy decapitating maniac! 
 
**Mash:**
Where's Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Run! 
 
**Soldier:**
Wh-What? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Never mind, just make a run for it now! Do you want to die? 
 
**Commander:**
D-Don't run! That's the Dragon Witch over there! 
 
**Commander:**
Take her down! Avenge your hometown! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Ugh! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Wyvern. Start off by eating the soldier! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Aaaaarrrghhhhhhhh! 
 
**Jeanne:**
(pant, pant, pant)...
 
**C：Soldier:**
H-Hey, isn't that the Dragon Witch? 
 
**C：Soldier:**
Why is she fighting the dragons? 
 
**E：Soldier:**
Don't ask me, but this is perfect. Let them both go down. 
 
**E：Soldier:**
They burned my homeland to the ground. I hope both of them die! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
The people you're protecting are saying all kinds of things about you, my Saint. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Even though the only reason they can safely watch this is because you're dealing with the wyverns. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Please leave me be. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Heh, how stubborn. If you're worried about your lack of manpower, then by all means, why don't you ask the French army? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Oh, forgive me. You're the "Dragon Witch" now, aren't you? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
A saint cruelly burned to death and then resurrected for revenge. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
A beautiful, ephemeral, and ultimately ridiculous tale. And look, you're still struggling&ndash;
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Because this time, they see you as the enemy! 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Can you tell me, Jeanne d'Arc? How do you feel right now? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Do you wish to die? Or do you wish to kill? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Do you long to drive that flag into those soldiers' hearts like a stake? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Normally, I'd fall into distress. I'd fall into despair. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But, unfortunately&ndash;I'm an optimist in life. Their hatred of me gives them the strength to rise. 
 
**Jeanne:**
And that's a good thing. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
...Are you sane? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Good question. People questioned my sanity when I decided to bring salvation to France. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Yes. Whether light or dark, it just means both of us are insane! 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Wyvern! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Ugh! 
 
**F：???:**
Artillery, FIRE! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Huh? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Ugh! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles! 
 
**Gilles:**
Prioritize all surrounding dragons! Fire all cannons! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Now! 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Curse you! 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Heh&ndash;I expect nothing less from a Ruler. Even with your power stolen, your physical strength...
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Retreat! Lancelot! Sanson! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Wait! 
 
**Lancelot:**
...A...A&mdash;Urrrrrrr!! 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Sanson:**
...It would seem that Jeanne d'Arc has touched the strings of his heart. 
 
**Sanson:**
Now what, Carmilla? Will he even listen to reason? 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
...Retreat! We have no obligation to stay with a black knight that's lost his mind. 
 
**Berserk Assassin:**
Lancelot! Buy us as much time as you can. Until the moment your life is extinguished! 
 
**Lancelot:**
...Arrrrrrrrrrr! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Ugh! Why are you...
 
**Mash:**
W-We have to stop them! Master, it's a once in a lifetime chance! 
 
**Mash:**
It breaks the code of chivalry, but we have to bring down Lancelot! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right, let's do it! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's clearly no longer a knight! 
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Lancelot:**
A-Arthur...
 
**Jeanne:**
Arthur? ...You mean your king, Arthur? 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Unfortunately, I am Jeanne d'Arc. I am not Arthur, the king you seek. 
 
**Mash:**
...Oh, I see. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's wrong? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I know why Lancelot was so obsessed with Jeanne. She resembles Arthur, doesn't she? 
 
**Mash:**
Not her face, but her soul&ndash;
 
**Lancelot:**
My...king...I...please...
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne, let's go. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes! 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne! Please wait! You are indeed Jeanne d'Arc! 
 
**Gilles:**
Not the Dragon Witch, but a bona fide saint! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Shouldn't you answer? 
 
**Jeanne:**
If I answer, I will endanger Gilles's position. For now, we can't depend on them. 
 
**Jeanne:**
At the very least, we must endure the scorn of those who once fought by our side. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But...Do they really hate you? 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Let's go. 
 
**Commander:**
General. What was that just now...
 
**Gilles:**
I don't know. I don't know, but...re-examine everything we know of the Dragon Witch. 
 
**Gilles:**
Was it truly Jeanne d'Arc who attacked Charles VII? Or some evil imposter? 
 
**Gilles:**
It's possible...That there may be two Jeanne d'Arcs in this world. 
 
## Section 9: Pause 
 
**Mash:**
...It looks to be an abandoned fort. Let's rest here for now. 
 
**Jeanne:**
How is Siegfried's wound? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
My Noble Phantasm can heal wounds, just a bit. But not this one, it seems. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...It looks like some kind of curse. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Why were you in that city? 
 
**Siegfried:**
It seems that I was summoned relatively early. 
 
**Siegfried:**
I was drifting without a Master...That's when I saw the town being attacked. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So you went to rescue them? 
 
**Siegfried:**
Yes...Though it's not like when I was alive. Still, with Balmung, I managed somehow. 
 
**Siegfried:**
When you're attacked by multiple Servants, it's not easy to pull off. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...Then one of them hid me in the castle. My wound wouldn't heal, and I couldn't ask anyone for help either. 
 
**Siegfried:**
I had no choice but to wait. 
 
**Mash:**
Was it a woman who could control a dragon? 
 
**Siegfried:**
Dragon? No, it was a turtle...No, a dragon...A dragon turtle...Now that you mention it, is it possible for that kind of dragon to exist? 
 
**Siegfried:**
Oh. She had the aura of a Ruler, similar to what you have. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It was St. Martha, I'd say. 
 
**Siegfried:**
So that's St. Martha, the one who drove off the evil dragon Tarasque. I want to thank her&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Siegfried:**
I see, then never mind. I am sure she's prepared for the worst. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Still, I feel guilty that she saved me when I was useless. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Baptism Rites could probably remove this curse. But, a Servant of considerably high rank must perform it&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Jeanne, you can do that, can't you? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...No. I tried, but my power alone isn't enough. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Multiple curses have been put on Siegfried.... It's a miracle he's even alive. 
 
**Jeanne:**
We need another Saint to remove multiple curses at once. 
 
**Mash:**
A Servant who was a saint...Hmm? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Yes, we do have a chance. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If St. Jeanne d'Arc...Sorry, Jeanne the "Dragon Witch" has the Holy Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There is a possibility&ndash;that a Saint was summoned as the result of the Counter Force. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
St. Martha was actually summoned, right? Do you guys know any Saint Servants to ask? 
 
**Siegfried:**
You're the only Servants that I've ever met. 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne and I don't know any other Servants beside the ones who became enemies. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Staying together is probably safer, but maybe it be better if we split up? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Unless we remove the curses on "Dragon Slayer"Siegfried, we can't defeat Fafnir can we? 
 
**Jeanne:**
But...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh, well.... It's nothing. 
 
**Jeanne:**
You are right. I think that's a reasonable idea. What do you think, Fujimaru? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's look for that Saint. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Break into teams and look around France. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
"Fortunately" may not be appropriate to say, but the French territories have already been reduced to less than half. 
 
**Mash:**
Searching them should be easy. How to split up is the problem...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa, I'm sorry to interrupt, but look at those wandering monsters. 
 
**Mash:**
Wander...What? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Well, never mind. Anyway, we've got enemies. Let's deal with them now so we can continue our discussion. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I just had a great idea! Let's draw lots right now! 
 
**Mash:**
...Excuse me? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
These things should be settled by drawing lots! Amadeus, please prepare some! 
 
**Amadeus:**
You just want to draw lots, don't you? ...All right, all right, I'll make some. Let's split up based on that. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I am with, Marie. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Amadeus. Please look after Fujimaru and the others. 
 
**Amadeus:**
To be honest, I'm nervous about leaving your side. Not that there's a time when I'm not nervous about you. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...But lots are derived from fate. If I defy fate, I might invite misfortune. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Well, you can use your Noble Phantasm to escape, and Jeanne is a defense specialist. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I'm rather worried about our side. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash's skill is as good as hers. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Actually, Mash's is better. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master...Thank you! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Actually, what I meant was it's because we have Siegfried who's wounded. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, well. I was taken advantage of. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Amadeus, make sure you get along with them. You tend to be misunderstood by friends. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I don't want to hear it from you. Anyway, Maria...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yeah? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Well, never mind. Just be careful along the way. Don't try to find a pastry shop even if you get hungry. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh! My heart beat thinking that you might propose to me again! 
 
**Amadeus:**
&mdash;Wait. Why would you bring that up now? 
 
**Mash:**
Propose? What? Marie? And Amadeus? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, you didn't know Mash? It's a pretty popular story. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
When Mr. Amadeus, standing right there, was 6 years old, he proposed to Marie who was 7 years old. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, I reached out to him as he fell, then I saw him staring at me with his starry eyes&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
"Thank you, nice lady. My name is Amadeus. "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
"If a beautiful lady like you has no fiance yet, could I be the first one? "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
He said that to me! I'd never been flattered like that since I was born! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Who knew the story would get passed down...this is a nightmare...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hehehe. Of course it would. I was so happy that I told everybody about it. 
 
**Amadeus:**
So it was you! You did it! You turned me down! You're such a femme fatale! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I had no choice. After all, I couldn't decide who would be my fiance. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Besides&mdash;
 
**Amadeus:**
Besides? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You know how my life was after that, don't you? I was happy with my decision. It was best to turn you down. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It turned out that you were loved by many people as a musician. That's why I ended my life as a silly queen. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It can't be helped you see, I have no choice because I'm always in love. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Maybe I was in love with a country named France. I only loved the country itself, not the people...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Because I was such an arrogant woman, I ended up getting killed by the nation. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Marie, that's...
 
**Amadeus:**
...What is that? Are you a fool? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Am I? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Yes, you are. You've got it all wrong. You say you were in love with France? 
 
**Amadeus:**
You're wrong. It's not that you were in love with the country. France was in love with you. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&mdash;...Yes. Thank you, Mozart. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Wait. Isn't that strange? Doesn't that mean that I was killed by the people who loved me? 
 
**Amadeus:**
That's right. That's how people are. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Love can easily turn to hatred. You were hated precisely because you were loved. 
 
**Mash:**
...Hated because she was loved...They were in love, yet killed the one they loved...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I see. People are complicated. Until I died, well, even after I died, I couldn't reach love. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But I think I'm fine with it now. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'm Marie Antoinette, a woman loved by France! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
See you, Amadeus! I'm leaving now! When I come back, let me listen to your piano again! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, Jeanne. Let's keep in contact with each other at regular intervals. 
 
**Mash:**
It's a Chaldean communication device. It allows communication via magical energy. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Very well. I'll hold onto it, then. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Take care. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful. 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, thank you. Fujimaru, please take care as well. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Amadeus:**
...What I just spoke about was out of line. Let's get going. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't you want to follow her? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you still love Marie? 
 

---

 
**Amadeus:**
Certainly not. I have no more passion for her. She was just a special divergence in my fate. 
 
**Amadeus:**
If I'd led a decent life, the divergence would've been that proposal. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Like what you'd call the cornerstone of human history. 
 
**Amadeus:**
What choices would this man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have made to end up this way? 
 
**Amadeus:**
No matter what happens. No matter what lovers I meet,what friends I gain, what bliss I grasp. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I would offer my life to music, and become a scum that abandons all human virtue. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But there's just one thing. 
 
**Amadeus:**
If there were someone who could change my fate, I think it would've been her. 
 
**Mash:**
...Amadeus. Doesn't that mean that you love Marie? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, sure. I do love her. It's just that I'm not in love with her any more. Is there a problem with that. 
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know. Before you said that we humans are filthy. 
 
**Mash:**
Based on what you said, that means you think Marie is also filthy without exception...
 
**Amadeus:**
So what? I love anything filthy. Music is beautiful. We humans are filthy. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You weren't aware of such differences? It's just a matter of category, isn't it? 
 
**Mash:**
Well...what? You said that humans only love beautiful things...
 
**Amadeus:**
It's not that we can only love something beautiful. What I meant was humans can love beautiful things, too. 
 
**Mash:**
Well...To me, that difference is too abstract...
 
**Amadeus:**
Hmm, I guess I can't make you understand it with words. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You'll understand someday. You're going to continue your journey with Fujimaru, right? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Then you'll figure it out. When it comes to the topic of humanity, {(M) he /(F) she} is an ideal Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes! I can completely understand the "ideal Senpai" part! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Trust can be heavy sometimes. 
 

---

 
**Siegfried:**
...Excuse me. I understand that you guys are talking about something nice, but...
 
**Siegfried:**
It seems enemies are coming. I'm sorry for being insensitive...
 
**Fou:**
Fou...Fou, Fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;What! Darn! Sieg snatched what I was supposed to do! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I hope you'll understand what made me drop my guard. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You know, I thought he was as much of a loser as me,but he's actually a great person with a deep view on life. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Don't worry about it, Doc. I feel sympathy for you too. 
 
**Amadeus:**
We are basically good-for-nothing humans...Or adults, I should say. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, thanks Amadeus! I've never been this unhappy with words of comfort! 
 
**Mash:**
Enough. Please monitor the battle! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We're done here. Siegfried, are you all right? 
 
**Siegfried:**
I've recovered enough to walk. Anything but combat should be fine. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...I'm going to be making trouble for you a little longer. I'm sorry. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's regroup and set off! I'm going to put everything into detecting Servants! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Jeanne, Jeanne. You have a scary look on your face! 
 
**Jeanne:**
What? ...D-Do I look scary? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hehehe, not so much scary as...Stern? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Well...I guess so. I was doing some thinking. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You mean about the Dragon Witch? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes. Exactly. 
 
**Jeanne:**
From the day I was born I've received God's revelations, and I just ran off without even looking back. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I became a Heroic Spirit after I died, and then was summoned as a Ruler.... I accept this fact as part of the natural order of things. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I don't understand&ndash;anything the Dragon Witch says, not a single word. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I wonder...Who that "me" is. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;Ah, you really are beautiful. Very, very, very&ndash;beautiful. 
 
**Jeanne:**
D-Don't tease me. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Well, it's the truth. If I were you&ndash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I would probably accept the things the "Dragon Witch" says. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Marie? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I don't hate the people who executed me. It's a fact that I'm 90% positive about. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But the 10% that's left...Or, it might be much smaller than that. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I hated those who killed my children&ndash;just for a little bit. 
 
**Jeanne:**
!!! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
They killed my son Charles, to hurt me...You should truly feel pity for him. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So, if my version of the Dragon Witch appears,I would probably think "oh, that's the other me. "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And accept the things she says. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But that's not the case for you, is it Jeanne? It's something really great and beautiful. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's not because you don't want to get dirty, or don't want to believe you are. Nor does that mean you lack something. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You like&ndash;people, don't you? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
People who try to move forward by groveling around. The unreasonable ones, the accusers. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes. I do love them. Oh I see, there was no way I could hold a grudge against them&ndash;because I loved them. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. That's why France was saved by you. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's okay, tell the Dragon Witch when you see her. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Tell her? Well, tell her what? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Say what you want to say out loud. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Say, "You're not me. "Or, "I don't know you. "
 
**Jeanne:**
Marie...Well, you're right. Absolutely right. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I certainly&ndash;Oh, huh? ...Know you, maybe? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You're starting to look serious again...I'm sorry, it wasn't of any help? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Y-Yes.... It was very helpful. 
 
**Jeanne:**
When I confront her next time, I'm sure I can tell her what I want to say. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, you should be fine. Oh, I think it's time to make our regular contact. 
 
**Jeanne:**
That's right we should. Let's do that now&ndash;
 
## Section 10: Saint 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne and the others will be arriving soon it seems. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's do our best, too. We'll soon arrive in Thiers. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Thiers...If I recall, it's famous for its knives. So far it looks like it hasn't been destroyed. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, any signs of Servants? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm checking...All right, there are two Servants in Thiers. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's make contact right away&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
...Flame just went up in that town, didn't it? 
 
**Amadeus:**
This noise...I hate it! An unprecedented noise, the premonition of an unprecedented demon! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, Muses! Please show mercy! My body can't stop trembling from fear. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's hurry up. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's check it out. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
O-Okay! Everyone, follow me! 
 
**H：???:**
You! You, you, you! You cheeky squirrel fom the East! 
 
**G：???:**
Hehehe! Who's the actual cheeky one? Do you really think a failure like you can beat&ndash;
 
**G：???:**
A true Dragon like myself, Elisabeth? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ughhhhh! I'm so upset! I'll deal with Carmilla later, you die first! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
You creepy stalker! 
 
**G：???:**
I'm not a stalker. I'm "a devoted bodyguard who acts like a spy. "
 
**G：???:**
I, Kiyohime, am a woman who lives for love. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Your love violates human rights! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I don't want to hear it from a pervert with a fetish for blood torture. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I imagine that you were doing it...as doing THAT. Weren't you? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What's "doing it? " What's "doing that? "Don't talk nonsense! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
...What? Elisabeth, I didn't know that you were&ndash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ahhhhhhh! Shut up, shut up, shut up! I'm going to&ndash;kill you! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
You can't kill me because I'll kill you! 
 
**Both:**
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Enough! Stop right there! I can't let you go further. What you're doing is sacrilege against all of voice and sound! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are they saints? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They aren't saints, are they? 
 

---

 
**Amadeus:**
No way! Religions would tumble if they're saints. 
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, we have to stop them! Hey, you two! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? What? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I'm busy right now. Come back the day before yesterday. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hmph. You'll no longer be busy soon. Until the next Holy Grail War that is! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
...Hmph. Frilled-necked lizard. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Japanese Rat Snake! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Mexican Bearded Lizard. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Sharp-Nosed Viper! 
 
**Mash:**
Okay, stop! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Ahhh...My ears will rot...You scum...Oh no, I'm forbidden to say that. I promised Maria. 
 
**Amadeus:**
By the way, Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
What now? 
 
**Amadeus:**
To our great joy, enemies are coming. For the sake of my ears, let's deal with them. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Black Mamba! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Japanese Grass Lizard! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Let's go! By the time we come back,I am hoping they'll be done, too! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
More are coming! It's the wyverns this time! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No sign of any other Servants besides those two. Don't worry, go ahead and fight! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am getting a powerful reading. Brace yourselves! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Looks like the enemy assault has stopped...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Grr, grr, grr, grr, grr! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
...Hmmmmmm. 
 
**Mash:**
We can't let those two to fend for themselves, can we? 
 
**Amadeus:**
...I can't. I've had it. I'm about to vomit. Yes, I'm leaving those people to you all...
 
**Siegfried:**
Since I am useless and can't fight, I won't say a thing.... Sorry. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Both of you, knock it off. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You shouldn't fight. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Did you just say something? 
 
**Mash:**
Well, that you shouldn't fi&ndash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
Back off, {(M) Puppy /(F) Deerlet}! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Recklessness and bravery aren't the same. Are you stupid? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's better than reptiles. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a mammal, at least. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
M-Master? Hey Master, aren't you a little upset? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Now I'm pissed. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
You said it. You'll regret your words from the bottom of Hell. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Elisabeth, let's get started! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Fine! Just don't get cocky just because you beat some wimpy wyverns! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'll show you the terror that a Dragonkin can inflict! 
 
**Mash:**
Did they just team up? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Kiyohime:**
Y-You got me...Ooooh. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
N-Not bad, you know...I'll let you call it a day now...
 
**Mash:**
Now that things have settled, I'd like to hear from you. Would you mind? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...What? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I'm a loser snake, in other words, you're kicking a defeated snake when it's down? 
 
**Mash:**
Loser snake? Um, have you ever seen any other Servants besides yourselves? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Well, I've seen crazy Servants. Like this one. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Would you mind not lumping me in with them? I'm a Berserker with my reasoning intact. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What's your problem? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
What is it? 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Oh, now I remember. When I was alive, I saw them often. Catfights! They were beyond loud. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Just you wait, in time they'll latch on to your head and make noises like, "gyaggggegggo! "
 
**Elisabeth:**
I will not! But that's called shamisen right? Shamisen? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I've said this many times, but would you not lump me in with them? 
 
**Mash:**
Anyways! You haven't seen any Servants other than the "Dragon Witch" or Carmilla's group, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Master...It looks like we've just wasted our time. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That sucks. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Elisabeth aside, treating me like that is a little bit rude, don't you think? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What a shame. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What's that about shame! You met ME, and it's a shame!? 
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're looking for a saint. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're only interested in saints. 
 

---

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh. It takes guts to make that comeback...But in any case, a saint? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I only know of one saint, if you mean someone whose teachings took root deep within this nation. 
 
**Mash:**
Really? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes. I met him before coming across Elisabeth. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I almost fought him, but he realized I was a "genuine"Berserker and he sheathed his sword. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
His True Name is Georgios. I believe he is quite a famous saint around here. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Georgios! The saint referred to as St. George.... Yes, he would be perfect. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Do you know where he went? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
That's the real shame. He went the opposite direction as me, to the west. 
 
**Mash:**
The west...That's where Jeanne and the others went. Commencing communication! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes, we're fine. We detected a Servant over here as well. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm about to make contact right now. 
 
**Georgios:**
Please stop right there. Who are you? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I am a Servant. My class is Rider,but my True Name is Marie Antoinette. 
 
**Georgios:**
...I see, you are not under Madness Enhancement. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. I'm on the side opposing them, and this is&ndash;
 
**Georgios:**
I see...She is the holy maiden. Best we keep her name undisclosed. 
 
**Georgios:**
This city has been razed by the Witch and her dragon. I was able to make them retreat, but that won't happen again. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Then, will you come join us? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Our "Dragon Slayer" is cursed, and we need to remove it immediately. 
 
**Jeanne:**
However, multiple curses are entwined together, so both you and I must be present...
 
**Georgios:**
I understand the situation. 
 
**Georgios:**
...The residents have already started to evacuations. Let us depart once that has completed. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Thank you very much! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Georgios:**
A wyvern attack? There's been a lot of violence lately. 
 
**Jeanne:**
No, that wasn't it. This sensation...It's the "Dragon Witch! "
 
**Georgios:**
What did you say? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let's retreat, Georgios! We don't stand a chance against her right now! 
 
**Georgios:**
...But we can't do that yet. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh...
 
**Georgios:**
The civilians aren't evacuated. The mayor has entrusted me with their protection. 
 
**Georgios:**
I must fulfill that wish&ndash;Or else, I won't be able to stay a saint. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But...
 
**Georgios:**
...I know. If I stay, I will die. 
 
**Georgios:**
But even so&ndash;I can't abandon them. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Lord Georgios, you are a man who is thick in head and body. 
 
**Georgios:**
What was that? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But, the part of you that is terribly cute has touched my heart. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And so&mdash;Please allow me to take over that duty. 
 
**Jeanne:**
What? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I am the Queen of France. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Even though that is in the "future" from here, for me neither "past" nor "present" make much difference. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Protecting the citizens is an important duty for me too, and you are now given a duty that can change everything. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
St. Georgios, go with Jeanne d'Arc and please lift the curse from the "Dragon Slayer. "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
In the name of Marie Antoinette, I will make sure to protect this city. 
 
**Jeanne:**
P-Please wait up! Wait, hey wait! Marie! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Marie, let us stay and fight with you! You can't do it alone, but I am sure the two of us can&mdash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Non. That makes me very happy, but you cannot, Jeanne. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I am sure I was summoned for precisely this moment. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Not to harbor hatred or defeat enemies, but to protect the people. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So that at this time, I will protect those dear to me. To save my dear country, I will do what is right. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, but please apologize to Amadeus for me. I never got to hear him play after all. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
He was 6, and I was 7. Since then, we've passed each other, but never met. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Marie! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Lord Georgios, do you agree to this arrangement? 
 
**Georgios:**
...If you are fine with it, I will humbly yield this role to you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Marie...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Now go, Jeanne. As short as our time was, it was the greatest honor to fight under your flag. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes.... I will be waiting. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Don't worry, I'll catch up soon. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Sanson, you're here. 
 
**Sanson:**
Of course I am. Execution needs qualifications. For both the executioner, and the executed. 
 
**Sanson:**
No other person has the right to execute you. You should have realized that Marie. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Let's see ...Hold on a second, Sanson. I know that you are a wonderful executioner. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I mean, you're cruel, merciliess, and inhuman, but you never once mocked criminals. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You guarded the guillotine with great respect, so I do indeed trust you. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But, does that mean you alone hold the right to kill me? Isn't that a bit absurd? 
 
**Sanson:**
It's not absurd. I was born into a family of executioners, and I was only taught how to execute. 
 
**Sanson:**
No compromise. It's not only about dedication,I am particular about the method&mdash;the technique. 
 
**Sanson:**
It's natural for a good executioner to not inflict pain on the criminal. I see beyond that. 
 
**Sanson:**
I see the&mdash;ecstasy. The moment it feels so good that "it will kill you. "
 
**Sanson:**
That is the type of beheading I dedicate myself to. The best slice of my life was my "kiss" for you. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...
 
**Sanson:**
So, this is destiny. I couldn't help but want to see you so I could ask...
 
**Sanson:**
Please, tell me, Marie. 
 
**Sanson:**
How was my beheading? Were you able to climax at the very end? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...I can see that you seriously showed respect for me Sanson, from the bottom of your heart. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But, I'm sorry. That's just impossible. It's something that I cannot possibly say...
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I already know enough men with perverse hobbies. Terribly sorry, but I can't accept a second kiss from you. 
 
**Sanson:**
Yes, I know. But I'm sure you will be delighted,I've gotten even better than back then. 
 
**Sanson:**
That is why I was summoned as a Servant. I shall give you the final ecstasy once again! 
 
**Mash:**
If we hurry, we might still make it in time. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Right, if we lose them for the sake of my revival, that would be a great loss. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I have a reading...Unfortunately, an enemy. Please hurry and defeat it! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Full power. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Understood. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes Master! Now, please stand back! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Sanson:**
That's, impossible! How could I be defeated? 
 
**Sanson:**
I've killed so many since that day, and become so much stronger...So why? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
How sad, Charles-Henri Sanson. I should've told you when we reunited. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Our relationship ended that day. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Because your blade was truly&mdash;rusty. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You've killed so many people that it's lost its way. You've increased your proficiency as a killer. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Executioners and killers are not the same, Sanson. The more skilled you become at killing others&mdash;
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
The rustier your blade as an executioner, savior of criminals, becomes. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
By the time you followed the Dragon Witch, you were no longer the Sanson I knew. 
 
**Sanson:**
No...Lies! It cannot be! I kept my faith that you would come! That's why I kept honing my skills! 
 
**Sanson:**
To see you, and behead you with more skill&mdash;Give you a much better ecstatic moment! 
 
**Sanson:**
I thought that by doing so, you would surely forgive me! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Geez. You really are a pitiful, adorable person. I don't hold a grudge against you. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
From the beginning, you never had the need to be forgiven by me. 
 
**Sanson:**
Ah...aah, ah&mdash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...That makes three. It's ironic how the ones who show potential are the first to fall. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. Perhaps the two vampires you loathe may be the last ones standing. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Good day, "Dragon Witch. "It seems you got here a little too late. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
"Myself" has already escaped. &ndash;How pitiful. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
No, that's not true. She left here embracing hope. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Just by gaining one Servant? How ridiculous. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Speaking of ridiculous, it's amazing that you are still here. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Are you intoxicated with the idea of saving these citizens? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You, the person killed by her citizens. A woman put to the guillotine, beheaded in ridicule! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So disappointing. Witches don't understand such simple logic? 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's true that I was executed. There was ridicule, and there was disdain. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
However&ndash;that gives me no reason to murder them in return. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I became a queen because the people asked me to. A queen cannot be without her people. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Thus, it was inevitable. If they don't want you,then you exit even if you don't want to. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That is the destiny of those serving their country. I believe my execution led to my people's next smile. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
No matter when, viva la France! Stars glimmer, and that will do. That's all we need. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Now I am certain. Say&ndash;"Dragon Witch. "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
"Who are you exactly? "
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Shut up! 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;Deploy Noble Phantasm. "Crystal Palace!! "
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Goodbye Jeanne, it was lovely meeting you. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If I can help the Saint who saved France...No, if I can help a friend. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Then I will gladly shed the last of my radiance and fall. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Like a star, like a flower. Like a fleeting dream. 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That is what a Servant is,and how Marie Antoinette lives&ndash;! 
 
## Section 11: Baptism Rite 
 
**Jeanne:**
Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, thank goodness! And who is&ndash;
 
**Georgios:**
My name is Georgios. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Where's Maria? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Marie is...
 
**Amadeus:**
I see. That's what she said when she stayed behind? Oh well, it can't be helped. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You don't have to feel bad. Even if we were there,she would've done the same thing. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Maria is an eternal philanthropist. That's how she lives and dies. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But never mind that, why don't you reverse Siegfried's curse? 
 
**Jeanne:**
R-Right! 
 
**Mash:**
Amadeus...
 
**Amadeus:**
It's all right, I knew this was going to happen. Remember how Maria was talking about the piano? 
 
**Amadeus:**
See, that was her way of saying goodbye. It never happened when we were alive. 
 
**Amadeus:**
If she'd said to me "Let me hear your piano,"I couldn't have stopped her. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But, the second farewell hits hard. Worse than the first. All the more as we'll never meet again. 
 
**Mash:**
Eh...Um, if you are Heroic Spirits, wouldn't there be a chance to see each other again? 
 
**Mash:**
Like now, you may be called to the same battlefield...
 
**Amadeus:**
Mm, that won't happen, I think? There are as many Heroic Spirits as the stars. 
 
**Amadeus:**
How I came across her this time was already a miracle. Though, a whimsical Master might change things a bit. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Anyway, I'm a bit tired. I'm going to excuse myself,call for me when you're ready to leave. 
 
**Mash:**
Wait...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You shouldn't, Mash. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stop Mash. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master, but&ndash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's fine. Everyone has moments where they want to be alone. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
That's right, Mash, you don't understand a man's heart quite yet. 
 
**Mash:**
You're right. Now that aside...
 
**Mash:**
...Why are YOU here? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's fine, isn't it? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
You don't approve of us being here? We're willing to assist you in combat. 
 
**Mash:**
Well, that is something to be thankful for, but...
 
**Kiyohime:**
By the way, Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
ME? 
 

---

 
**Kiyohime:**
Of course you. Though temporary, can you enter a contract with me? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, sticking out your pinky is enough. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
This is a pinky promise, if you lie, I'll make you swallow a thousand needles...
 
**Kiyohime:**
This completes the contract! Just so you know...I really will make you swallow a thousand needles if you lie. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Is that clear? Please take care of me from now on. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, Jeanne's group seems to have succeeded in lifting Siegfried's curse! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Okay, you will be fine from now on. This would probably have been impossible by myself. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...It's all thanks to Marie. We were able to survive because of her. 
 
**Jeanne:**
What she risked her life protecting is something I want to protect too. 
 
**Jeanne:**
This era, this world, this country&ndash;To do so,let's defeat the "Dragon Witch" and, the dragon. 
 
**Siegfried:**
&ndash;All right, I can move now. I apologize for all your efforts, Fujimaru. 
 
**Siegfried:**
No, Master...The more correct way to put it is,I appreciate all your efforts from the bottom of my heart. 
 
**Siegfried:**
I shall entrust my sword to you. This body will be my Master's sword and shield. 
 
**Siegfried:**
My True Name is Siegfried. I have no other skill than slaying dragons, but I'd be honored to be put to use. 
 
**Mash:**
That sound...It's the wyverns! 
 
**Siegfried:**
...It looks like it's my turn already. Please command me. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I will leave them to you. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go get them. 
 

---

 
**Siegfried:**
Yeah. &ndash;My name is Siegfried, here I go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, now we have ourselves a team. 
 
**Mash:**
That's right Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's attack Orleans. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's take down the dragon. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! Understood Master! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Hmph. I wouldn't mind helping you out with that, little Puppy. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
My, my, Elisabeth, calling my Love a Puppy is an insult. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Did you just make a ridiculous word change? Well, I don't care. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm not a cheap dragon. I will meet an extra-special Master someday! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh, so the horn on your head isn't the only thing twisted. Seeking an impossible dream...Is your head okay? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's not an impossible dream! It's conviction! I'm convinced of it! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'll someday meet a Master that is to my liking and will love me! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, yes, in your head it's another cloudless day. 
 
**Georgios:**
...Our team sure is a lively one. Of course, I will be in your service. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, heading out already? Then I'll tag along. I've come this far, might as well see the end. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Fujimaru. No, Master. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Right now, I am merely a powerless Servant. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But I wish to protect this world. Please, fight with me. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That is our duty. 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Thank you so much! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Jeanne:**
Let's make camp here tonight to prepare for tomorrow's showdown...
 
**Jeanne:**
First, we'll have to secure the area. Everyone prepare for battle, we're surrounded. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Don't draw too much attention, and refrain from any flash attacks so we can end this soon...Wait. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Fujimaru,I don't see Mash or Amadeus anywhere...
 
**Amadeus:**
Well crap, I just came to get a bit of water. How unlucky of me to be assaulted by enemies. 
 
**Mash:**
Amadeus, over here! I'll go up to the front line, so please hide behind me! 
 
**Amadeus:**
I'd take up your offer...but I can't. This time the situation is different. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I can't run away if the front line is just you, Mash. Let me fight with you. 
 
**Mash:**
Amadeus? Will you be all right? You'll get hurt, you know! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, it's a rehearsal to prepare for tomorrow's battle. A few wounds? No worries. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Amadeus:**
Whew! We made it through in one piece, but we accidentally left the forest during the battle. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Fujimaru and Jeanne must be worried. Let's rest awhile, then return to camp. 
 
**Mash:**
...Um. It seems a bit crazy to ask questions at a time like this, but do you mind? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Of course not. Be it important or trivial, ask away. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Tomorrow is the final battle. You should wrap up any unfinished business. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. I hate to bring this back up...
 
**Mash:**
But it's about when we heard that Marie had died. This is what you said, Amadeus. 
 
**Mash:**
"Humans choose what they love. "I don't understand what that meant. 
 
**Mash:**
Rather, I understand the meaning of the words,it's the "choose" part that I don't understand. 
 
**Mash:**
I mean, things we should view favorably are morally just,and things we should reject are socially bad. 
 
**Mash:**
That's what I was taught. I feel deep down that it's right. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Hmm. What do you consider right then? 
 
**Mash:**
Well...Something that saves many lives, and sees value in many lives, I suppose. 
 
**Amadeus:**
That's rather ill-defined. Let's assume for a moment that Fujimaru were not such a person. What then? 
 
**Mash:**
But that's...
 
**Amadeus:**
Forgive me, that was a mean assumption. However, keep that hesitation and discomfort in mind. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Mash, I suspect that you are a person who has only recently gained her freedom. 
 
**Amadeus:**
As such, you freeze in the face of hard choices and have doubts about the person you are becoming. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, I think you might be right. I, uh...didn't know much about the outside world. 
 
**Mash:**
...No. Maybe I never had the right to care for anything in the first place. 
 
**Mash:**
I mean, I&mdash;
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, dear. You truly are pure, aren't you? You're like a music sheet without a single note on it. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But heed my words, Mash. Even if you are a doll created for the sole purpose of fighting...
 
**Amadeus:**
...You have the obligation to care for something. You may not have freedom, but you have obligations. 
 
**Mash:**
Obligations? Not rights or privileges? 
 
**Amadeus:**
No, obligations. Or duties, if you like. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Humans have that responsibility, for they possess the intelligence to think. 
 
**Amadeus:**
What to care for, what to dislike, what is considered precious, what is considered evil. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Those are the things you must choose for your self. Not by the words of others, nor by conforming to your environment. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Every human is unique. So too is each one's values. 
 
**Amadeus:**
We learn and see as much as we can. By doing so, your life will be enriched. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Listen, the world is not what you make of it. You are what the world makes of you. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Then when you have become you, become more than this world. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You must leave proof that you existed, whatever it is. I have. All the music I left behind is proof. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Even though&mdash;that itself is insignificant. 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Amadeus:**
After all, I am a man who couldn't even bear witness to the death of his one and only first love. 
 
**Amadeus:**
My legacy may have been loved by many, but my actual life was nothing special. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Still, I am content with that. Human beings are filthy and unpleasant. My conclusion stands. 
 
**Amadeus:**
There are sinners who shine brilliantly and saints that make one retch. So there is no need for you to fear your own future. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You are created by the world, and you expand and improve the world. 
 
**Amadeus:**
That is what "being a human" is all about. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Begin by absorbing all you can from the world and then return those favors to the world as you see fit later. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Worrying over what results that will have is a matter for another day. 
 
**Mash:**
Amadeus...
 
**Amadeus:**
However, most things in this world have a fair value, and a result fit for such value. 
 
**Amadeus:**
As was the case with my music and my life. 
 
**Amadeus:**
As long as humans are human, evil will not prevail. After all, humanity will be unable to flourish otherwise. 
 
**Amadeus:**
It is said that "evil" is the hindrance to the prosperity of life. The species cannot survive with it there. 
 
**Amadeus:**
If humanity cannot purge itself of that "evil," that is the day of humanity's extinction. It's that simple. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...I see that you are now breathing more calmly. Our break is over Mash, let's return to the others. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Most likely this is the last time we shall chat. For some reason, it turned into a bit of a lecture. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Still, I'm happy that we were alone for this final talk. From start to finish, you're a charming young lady. 
 
**Amadeus:**
In this battle, I would have proposed to you had Maria not been there. 
 
**Mash:**
...I see. Thank you great composer Amadeus,I won't forget what you said. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Indeed. You pass, Mademoiselle. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I want you to remember one last thing. There's nothing more beautiful than a parting smile. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
The supplies have arrived, but apparently there's been a shift in topological space. 
 
**Mash:**
Our rations are being devoured by monsters. Senpai, are you okay with being hungry? 
 
**Mash:**
...I suppose not. Let's go! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, I had my eye on that! Don't eat it! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
You are so annoying! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, that looks good. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Then allow me to feed you, say "ahhh. "
 
**Mash:**
...What's gotten into you? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Amadeus:**
Hello, is this seat taken? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh, no! Be my guest. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I'm sorry to be a bother while you're relaxing, but those dragons over there are too noisy. 
 
**Jeanne:**
......Amadeus. Marie was very kind to me. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But of course. She was kind to everyone, but her affection for you was unique. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Why do you suppose that was? Because I'm a fellow Frenchwoman? 
 
**Amadeus:**
I'm not sure. I don't think it had anything to do with you being French. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Whether one is from England, Spain, or the Far East, that is of no importance to Maria. 
 
**Amadeus:**
The reason she was fond of you, that she held you in high esteem, was because you were a young woman who took a stand all on her own. 
 
**Amadeus:**
In a sense, Maria is the same. She became a queen at 14 and was forced into battle all alone in Versailles. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Of course, I'm sure that her battles paled in comparison to yours. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Battlefields with cannonballs and conspiracies are in truth, fundamentally different. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Nevertheless, it was indeed a life or death struggle for her. That is why she empathized with you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Because she was living through a lonely battle of her own? 
 
**Amadeus:**
And one other reason. This is the important one. 
 
**Amadeus:**
For Maria, standing up for a loved one is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Be it family, another person, a Servant&ndash;or even the nation itself. 
 
**Amadeus:**
True, she was a sheltered girl who knew no hardship, so her way of standing up for someone was rather off-key. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Oh, is that so? In that case, I wanted to stand up for her as a friend. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Given the situation, nothing could've been done,but I wish&ndash;I could've been by her side. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...I like to believe so. 
 
**Amadeus:**
A friend, eh? Yes, you thinking of her that way would be the ultimate reward for her. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Maria and I have one thing in common. We were not blessed with friends. 
 
**Amadeus:**
But, her wish was fulfilled in this second life. I get the feeling she was able to move on with a light heart. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Um...Actually, I think of you as a comrade. Fujimaru feels the same too. 
 
**Amadeus:**
No, no, that won't do. After all, I don't think that of you. Maria said it, remember? I'm fundamentally trash. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I only love music. That is how I lived my life, and I am proud of that fact. 
 
**Amadeus:**
That is why I cannot make friends. Instead, I left behind many pieces of music. 
 
**Amadeus:**
If I had any desire for human happiness, I would vanish in a cloud of self-hatred. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Still, thank you Jeanne d'Arc. I'm sure that Maria had no regrets. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I shall avenge her.... No, vengeance isn't important, is it? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I will make her wish come true. I will save this France. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Gilles, are you here? 
 
**Gilles:**
Yes, right here! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Marie Antoinette has perished, but what about Sanson? 
 
**Gilles:**
I am treating him right now. His mind perished with her. 
 
**Gilles:**
All we can do is to keep his Spiritron Shell intact, and use him as a foot soldier. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I see. Georgios escaped from that town. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Had Marie not sacrificed herself to buy time, our plan would have worked&ndash;
 
**Gilles:**
Ah, I see. The enemy ranks lost one, but also gained one. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
We're not at a disadvantage here, but it is a nuisance. Continue searching for them&ndash;
 
**Berserk Saber:**
It doesn't look like that will be necessary. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Saber? I thought I ordered you to search the southeastern region. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
There's no longer any need, Master. They're heading straight for Orleans. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
Looks like it's a final showdown they want. Don't you want the same thing? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...So, they've stopped running around have they? Which means they think they have a shot at winning. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
I suppose they do. They have many Servants as well. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
We might have dragons on our side, but this should still be a glorious fight. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You're enjoying yourself? 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
Of course. As you know, I'm not right in the head. I'll be just as happy with wiping them out as being wiped out by them. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
Go on, order me&ndash;Master. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Prepare for the final battle. Gilles, summon them, not just the Servants. 
 
**Gilles:**
Understood. I shall gather all the dragons who were slain in France. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...If we win, the world will be destroyed. Even if we lose, it will make no difference. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The world is long gone. Even if they correct this place, an endless journey lies ahead. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And yet...And yet, they have faith in the world&ndash;Those people, and "me. "
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
In that case, I shall smite them. I won't let them reconnect this world. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That is my wish, and Gilles' wish.... Yes, that should be my wish&mdash;
 
**--ARROW--**

**--BATTLE--**
 
**Siegfried:**
I seem to be the only one here with experience leading an army. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Of course, it's not as if I have a glorious military record where I led an army to invade a worthwhile country. 
 
**Siegfried:**
In any event, our numbers are few while the enemy's are large. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...But, most of the enemy's forces are weaker than us. In situations like this, there are two options. 
 
**Siegfried:**
A frontal assault, or an ambush from the rear. However, our location was given away long ago. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Stealth is out of the question. The enemy knows where we are...There's only one option. 
 
**Both:**
A frontal assault. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...Exactly. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Master and I will see to Fafnir. 
 
**Siegfried:**
I want the others to protect us from Servants and wyverns. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Whether we slay Fafnir or not, the outcome of this war hinges on that question. 
 
**Mash:**
...Understood. I'm inexperienced, but I'll fight with everything I have. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh Puppy, there is someone I must fight. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Would it be all right if I focus on her. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Go ahead. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh? Thanks. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who do you want to fight? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, a Servant I share a certain fate with. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
If I can do that, I'll be quite satisfied.... I'll lend you a hand if I can spare the time. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I, without a doubt, will be facing the "Dragon Witch" in battle. 
 
**Georgios:**
Can you defeat her? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes, I shall be victorious. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Even if she turns out to be the real Jeanne d'Arc, I will still prevail in battle. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Hm, I don't have an issue with anybody. I guess I will just try to get wyverns' attention. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
In that case...I shall be at our Master's side and breathe fire as needed. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
As they say, like moths to the flame, and scoundrels of dubious origin who stand in the way of romance. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Leave scouting the area to me. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is do-or-die time. I've got lots of energy drinks and buckets ready! 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, those have the opposite effect. They cause stomachaches, so maybe you shouldn't drink them...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am sure it will freshen me up if I dunk my face in it. Anyway, leave everything to me! 
 
**Siegfried:**
So, if no one has any questions...Master&ndash;please issue your orders. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's fight! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's win! 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
Right! Now, on to Orleans&mdash;! 
 
## Section 12: March to the Orleans 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...As predicted it's swarming with wyverns. Still, we can't afford any delays. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Everyone, take care of them as fast as you can. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood! Master, the enemies are coming, give me your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Amadeus:**
They're still coming! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servant detected! They're coming straight for you&mdash;It's our enemies! 
 
**Berserk Archer:**
...I'll kill you...I'll kill you all! Every last one of you, shatter before my bow! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Archer...She's been forced under Madness Enhancement as well! 
 
**Georgios:**
She must be the type of Servant who'd never serve the Dragon Witch. 
 
**Mash:**
It can't be helped! I'm taking her out! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Berserk Archer:**
...This is fine. This is fine. Really, what a troublesome and unrewarding job. 
 
**Berserk Archer:**
Go, and take down that dragon. Yes, next time for sure, I&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Berserk Archer's elimination is confirmed. I am getting a reading of a ultra-size lifeform! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fafnir's left Orleans. In other words...The showdown's about to begin! 
 
## Section 13: Jeanne and Jeanne 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hello, trash I left behind. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...No, I am a vestige. Most importantly, I'm not you Dragon Witch. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But you are me. What are you talking about? 
 
**Jeanne:**
...No matter what I say, I can no longer reach you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
After this battle is over, I'm going to give you an earful! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Silence! Behold these dragons! Behold this horde of dragons! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
We have turned this nation into a nest of dragons! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
They will devour everything, and nothing will ever live in France again! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Then this world will be complete. Then this world will be destroyed. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The dragons will fight one another for eternity. Endless war. Endless devouring. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That will be the true Hundred Years' War&ndash;A Hundred Years War of Evil Dragons! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Gilles! 
 
**Gilles:**
Fire! We fight for the survival of France! Fire everything we have! Fire! Fire! 
 
**Gilles:**
Do not be afraid! Do not sorrow! Do not falter! If you have human blood, now is the time to die! 
 
**Gilles:**
I will say it again! There is nothing to fear! For we&ndash;
 
**Gilles:**
"For we have the Saint on our side! "
 
**Jeanne:**
...Gilles! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hmph, such stubborn belief. It makes me want to vomit. Fafnir! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Incinerate that Saint, that army, this nation! Burn everything to the ground! 
 
**Siegfried:**
&ndash;Hah. I never thought I'd see you a third time. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Perhaps, in another time or another world, we could've been connected in another way&ndash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Siegfried! 
 
**Siegfried:**
Fafnir! I am here wicked dragon! I, Siegfried, am right here! 
 
**Siegfried:**
Once again, you shall taste the twilight. I swear by my righteousness, and by my beliefs&ndash;! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Come forth my Servants! 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
Hey you guys, good to see you doing well! 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
I am Chevalier d'Eon. This time I lend my blade to evil&ndash;but it remains as pure as ever. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
Now, fight me with all you have! End this nightmare! 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
...So you came, huh? There's no shame becoming fallen. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Defeat is the greatest shame of all. I've become a mere puppet in the search for the Grail&ndash;
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
I am praised as the immortal vampire. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Fiction or not, it is all I have left. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, they're coming! The French army is holding off the wyverns! 
 
**Mash:**
This is it! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you, Mash! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do it, Mash! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! We'll achieve victory together! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Berserk Saber:**
...We've lost. Now my curse will be broken. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
Thank you all. Apologies to my beloved queen. 
 
**Berserk Saber:**
I'm so sorry, my queen. Please forgive my mistake&ndash;
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
&ndash;Is it over now? My dreams, my ambitions will once again be erased? 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Hmph, who knew I'd deal with a "Dragon Slayer" again? How ironic. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
I see. So they were right, I am Dracul, the devil. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
It must be my destiny to fall in the presence of a Servant who slew devils and dragons. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Very well, I will allow it. You, the Master over there. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
You are a {(M) man /(F) woman} who does not lose sight of themselves amidst the battle. Next time, summon me. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
Then I will show you the true power of my lance. 
 
**Berserk Lancer:**
The lance that defended a nation&mdash;the weapons that defended my people...In your hands, they will shine&mdash;
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
(pant, pant, pant)...
 
**Sanson:**
Ahhh...Augh...augh! 
 
**Amadeus:**
I can't believe this, I was here fighting random enemies and the one I despise the most showed up. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Hey executioner, from the looks of it I guess Maria turned you down? 
 
**Sanson:**
Ama...deus? Aaaaamaaaaaadeeeeeeuuuuuus! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Mmm, why are you so fired up? Don't tell me Maria said something she shouldn't have. 
 
**Amadeus:**
For example, maybe&mdash; Although we are both scum,she said I am 100 times better. Something like that? 
 
**Sanson:**
Hah&mdash;Ah, ah&mdash;Shu&mdash;t up. Shut up, Amadeus! 
 
**Sanson:**
I won't let you beat me! You're the one man I'll never lose to! 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Whoa! Wait, did that give him back his sanity? 
 
**Amadeus:**
Jeez...I guess I should've kept my mouth shut. But&mdash;this makes things worth doing. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Charles-Henri Sanson, are you ready for me to take my frustration out on you? 
 
**Amadeus:**
I've actually got some energy for once. Enough energy to play an extra song on the piano. 
 
**Sanson:**
Whatever, I'll chop you fingers off. You know something, Amadeus? 
 
**Sanson:**
I always hated your Requiem! The way it turned death into mere music! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Tsk, this is the problem with gloomy muscleheads! Damn, his intensity's overwhelming! 
 
**Amadeus:**
Sorry, help me out Master! This is my last gift for Maria, let me make it a good one! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Sanson:**
Ha&mdash;I see. So I'm going down to you? 
 
**Sanson:**
Then...The evil one is me, no question about it. Justice is on your side. 
 
**Sanson:**
Just like last time, the queen smiled&ndash;as she took in the witch's flames. 
 
**Sanson:**
Not with resignation, but with hope.... May blessings be upon you. 
 
**Amadeus:**
You idiot, you actually cared whose side justice is on? 
 
**Amadeus:**
...How gloomy. This is why we need to get rid of jobs where you do nothing but kill people all day. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Bye Sanson, next time I see you I'll play my Requiem until you're sick of it. 
 
**Amadeus:**
I mean, you're actually a huge fan of the song aren't you? 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
Why, you! Why you, why you, why you! 
 
**Carmilla:**
This is...quite irritating. This "me. "
 
**Elisabeth:**
Right back at you! How did you get to be a Servant? 
 
**Carmilla:**
Never thought you'd say that. From where I sit,it's far more maddening to see that I've become a Servant as myself! 
 
**Carmilla:**
I'm a revered countess, feared by all. The finished product. 
 
**Carmilla:**
I'm not like an unfinished product like you. I devoured fear and became an Anti-Hero. 
 
**Carmilla:**
But what about you? 
 
**Carmilla:**
You devoured the existence that is me. You simply refused to age, and feared being sealed away. 
 
**Carmilla:**
Of course you did. From your perspective, I'm just a sign of your sin. 
 
**Carmilla:**
The guilt you brought upon yourself, the unassailable record of your murders! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...That's right. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
You are who I really am, my final destination. The symbol of my sin, that no tears will ever change. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Denying you means looking away from the crimes I've committed. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
But that doesn't mean I can't take responsibility! It may be ugly self-deception, but I'll say it anyway! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I...I don't want to be like you! 
 
**Carmilla:**
How foolish, we're spirits of the past. The future's already been decided. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I know that! But I'm saying it anyway! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Help me, Little Puppy! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
You may be a step down from the Master I dream of, but you're still first rate! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Please let me settle things with her! Let me sing with everything I have! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Carmilla:**
The future doesn't reject the past, but rather, the past rejects the future? 
 
**Carmilla:**
&ndash;Such drivel coming out of your mouth! But that's why...You're so dazzling, it's annoying. 
 
**Carmilla:**
Let me return to the darkness. That last instant...That light&mdash;that I saw between the bricks. 
 
**Carmilla:**
That's right...Whether I live or die,I&mdash;am always alone&mdash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Farewell, my future. Farewell, the part of myself so sad I had to separate. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
This will not lessen my sins, nor the fear others feel towards me. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I&ndash;will deny the future as many times as I must,and sing as many times as I must. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Siegfried:**
After multiple obstacles, we're finally here. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...Good work, Master. And Mash Kyrielight. 
 
**Siegfried:**
We're almost at the evil dragon. Confronting it like this&mdash;I must confess. 
 
**Siegfried:**
I don't know how I won the first time. 
 
**Mash:**
Hey! Don't say stuff like that now! 
 
**Siegfried:**
There's just one thing inscribed in my memory. 
 
**Siegfried:**
My victory was not a certain one. It was a single, tiny sliver of a chance, surrounded by a million defeats. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Plan carefully, move boldly, keep a broad perspective,and focus deeply upon a single point. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Be like the sea, the sky, the darkness, the light. Contradict thyself. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Unless you do that, there is no way you can defeat Fafnir. 
 
**Mash:**
I-I understand! I'll do what I can! 
 
**Siegfried:**
Oh, Master.... Are you ready? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course! 
 

---

 
**Siegfried:**
Heh. It's an honor to have such a bold Master. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Return to earth once more, wicked dragon! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Impossible! 
 
**Mash:**
...We've defeated it! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Confirming Fafnir's complete silence! Amazing, a new Dragon Slayer has been born! 
 
**Mash:**
Look! The wyverns are in a panic! 
 
**Siegfried:**
They must be confused because Fafnir, their commander, got taken out. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Ugh! 
 
**Gilles:**
Come back, Jeanne! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Gilles! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Gilles? 
 
**Gilles:**
First, let's get back to this prison castle! We need to regroup. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Understood. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Wait! 
 
## Section 14: Chase After Jeanne Alter 
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm off to settle the score with the "Dragon Witch. "
 
**Mash:**
Master, we'll head out there too. 
 
**Mash:**
We should leave this place to the other Servants, and track the "Dragon Witch! "
 
**Siegfried:**
You're right, let me handle this. Take Kiyohime and Elisabeth with you. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Very well. I look forward to working with you, Master. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's fine, but...Why us? 
 
**Siegfried:**
(Her Noble Phantasm hurts my ears...)(And Kiyohime breathes fire on anyone, friend or foe...)
 
**Georgios:**
(Both of their Noble Phantasms...)
 
**Amadeus:**
(Elisabeth's is the worst Noble Phantasm in the world, I'm sure of it. )
 
**Elisabeth:**
???
 
**Kiyohime:**
Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Ahem. L-Let's go, you two! 
 
**Gilles:**
Fafnir has fallen. Without it, the other wyverns...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm aware. Let us summon a new Servant. 
 
**Gilles:**
Indeed! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Gilles, defend me while I focus on the summoning. I'm counting on you. 
 
**Gilles:**
Understood. I'll use my Noble Phantasm, Prelati's Spellbook, to buy us time. 
 
**Gilles:**
Use that time to summon us a powerful Servant. 
 
**Gilles:**
Perhaps King Arthur? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I can't imagine an English knight answering my summons...But I'll see what I can do. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Good luck. 
 
**Gilles:**
Indeed Jeanne, I pray that the light of your glory is not tainted. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let us hurry! If we're too slow, she'll summon another Servant! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I-I know that! But you know, this castle's kind of nice...
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's kind of my style, you know? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, it's terrible! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, it's awful! 
 

---

 
**Kiyohime:**
Indeed, all this blood. They don't organize, they don't clean...how filthy. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Only a bloodthirsty barbarian would prefer a place like this. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Y-You're right! This is bad, isn't it! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, enemies! Let's finish them quickly! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoops, there's a Servant up ahead! Be careful! 
 
**Gilles:**
&ndash;Well, well, long time no see. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles! 
 
**Gilles:**
Who knew you'd defeat Fafnir, and show yourself here in Orleans...
 
**Gilles:**
To be honest, I am impressed. 
 
**Gilles:**
However! However! Oh, my saint! And your comrades! 
 
**Gilles:**
Why do you stand in my way? 
 
**Gilles:**
You come into my world destroying everything, and now you're even trying to kill Jeanne d'Arc! 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;I had a question about that. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles de Rais, is she really "me? "
 
**Gilles:**
...What? What-what-what unforgivable blasphemy! Even the Saint would despair and rage to hear such a thing! 
 
**Gilles:**
That is, without a doubt, the true Jeanne d'Arc. It is the darkness hidden within her! 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;I see. Then as the light, I must face her. 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne, I won't let anyone stop me&ndash;even you! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We can handle this! 
 
**Jeanne:**
But their numbers are great...Why you! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Never mind that, what's with this giant starfish? Oh gross, this weird liquid is dripping onto my clothes! Dripping! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
So filthy. Master, please protect me. 
 
**Mash:**
D-Do your job as a Servant, okay? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? This roar...
 
**Mash:**
Enemy sighted! This time it's a wyvern? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Jeez. How'd it fit inside this tiny castle? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilles:**
Curse you, curse you, curse you! In that case, take me on! 
 
**Gilles:**
My comrade Prelati...Grant me your power! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles...I shall release your soul! 
 
**Mash:**
Let's go! Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilles:**
...Ugh! 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh! As powerful as expected...I couldn't finish him off! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
We'll hold off this Servant! Master, you go on ahead! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Right, go settle the score with the last boss! 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you for your support! Jeanne! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jeanne! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's wrong? 
 

---

 
**Jeanne:**
...I-I'm sorry. It's nothing. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm going. Thank you both! 
 
## Section 15: The Dragon Witch 
 
**Jeanne:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne, what was bothering you just now? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh no, there was something on my mind...It's nothing important. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Anyway, it's time to confront the "Dragon Witch. "There shouldn't be anything in our way. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let's go! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...That was faster than I thought. I don't have time to modify the spell&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;"Dragon Witch. "
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So you finally made it here, huh? Gilles is&ndash;alive, but delayed. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I suppose that's fine. Everything is ready. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Tell her what she needs to hear.... That was Marie's instruction to me. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I have another thing to ask of you as well. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's too late for talking&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
It's a very simple question. Do you remember your family? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I asked you a simple question. 
 
**Jeanne:**
No matter how vivid my memories of battle are,I remember far more of my life as a simple country girl. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Even my dark side should remember those peaceful days. 
 
**Jeanne:**
No, it's precisely because she remembers them&ndash;that the hatred and betrayal brought her such pain. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I...I...
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;You don't remember, do you? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What...What does it matter? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Whether I remember or not, I'm still Jeanne d'Arc! 
 
**Jeanne:**
That's right. It doesn't matter whether you remember. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But this settles it. I shall defeat the "Dragon Witch" with sadness, not anger. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&ndash;My Servants! 
 
**Mash:**
These are...The Servants we saw in Fuyuki! And so many of them! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I didn't have time to summon a normal Servant, but I can summon as many of these as I like. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Crush them! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, they're coming! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do this, Mash! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Ugh...So they broke through that swarm? 
 
**Jeanne:**
We're going to settle this right now. "Dragon Witch"&ndash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Shut up! Let's fight! Will despair win, or will hope win&ndash;
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Will murderous intent win, or will pity win? Let's see if you can surpass me&ndash;Jeanne d'Arc! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What? 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Im-Impossible. Ridiculous. This can't be happening. It's a lie. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Because I&ndash;have the Holy Grail&ndash;! The owner of the Holy Grail knows no defeat. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's how it should be! 
 
**Gilles:**
Oh, Jeanne! Jeanne! What a pitiful sight you are! 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Gilles...
 
**Gilles:**
But now that I, Gilles de Rais, am here you can rest. 
 
**Gilles:**
Now then, sleep in peace. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But&ndash;I still haven't...I haven't destroyed France...
 
**Gilles:**
I will take care of that. Leave everything to me. 
 
**Gilles:**
Don't worry. You will never die. You're just a little...a little tired. 
 
**Gilles:**
Close your eyes, and rest. When you awake, I'll have finished everything. 
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Yes, yes you're right. Gilles...If you'll fight for me, I can rest, and...
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Gilles:**
...
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;So that's how it ended up, after all. 
 
**Gilles:**
You have a powerful intuition. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, there she is! 
 
**Kiyohime:**
To think that you'd make a sudden run for it...
 
**Mash:**
Um, Jeanne? What exactly&ndash;
 
**Jeanne:**
It wasn't the "Dragon Witch" who possessed the Holy Grail. 
 
**Jeanne:**
No, actually that Servant, never existed in the Throne of Heroes. 
 
**Jeanne:**
As long as she wasn't an aspect of my darkness, there was no other conclusion I could make. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Then how did she acquire that massive strength? 
 
**Jeanne:**
That couldn't have been anything but the Holy Grail. In other words, the Dragon Witch herself&ndash;
 
**Gilles:**
Exactly. The Dragon Witch herself was my wish. 
 
**Gilles:**
In other words, the Holy Grail itself. 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? The dragon's the Holy Grail? Then me, too? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
You dragon-dummy, Jeanne d'Arc didn't use the Grail for evil. 
 
**Jeanne:**
You&ndash;created Jeanne d'Arc with the power of the Grail, didn't you? 
 
**Gilles:**
My wish was to revive you. It was a wish from my heart,from the bottom of my heart. Of course it was. 
 
**Gilles:**
...But the Grail rejected me. For all its omnipotent power, it said it couldn't do that! 
 
**Gilles:**
But my wish was only for you! So I created a new you! 
 
**Gilles:**
The Saint I believed in! The Saint I longed for! I created her! 
 
**Gilles:**
Jeanne d'Arc&ndash;the Dragon Witch. The Grail itself! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...I see. But of course, she never learned that did she? 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles, even if you could revive me, I would never become your Dragon Witch. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It's true that I was betrayed, it's true that I was mocked. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It could only be described&ndash;as a tragic end. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But I could never hate my homeland. This is where you and the others lived. 
 
**Gilles:**
...So kind. Your words are far too kind. However, Jeanne...
 
**Gilles:**
Your kindness has made you forget one thing. Even if you never hated this country&ndash;
 
**Gilles:**
I HATED THIS COUNTRY! I swore I would destroy it for its betrayal! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles...
 
**Gilles:**
You will forgive them I'm sure. But I never will! Not God! Not the King! Not the nation! 
 
**Gilles:**
I'll destroy them all. I'll kill them all. That is the wish I made upon the Grail! 
 
**Gilles:**
DO NOT GET IN MY WAY, JEANNE D'ARC! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes, you're right. You're absolutely right. 
 
**Jeanne:**
It makes perfect sense for you to hate, and for you to use the Grail's power to destroy France. 
 
**Jeanne:**
And I&ndash;I will stop you. As a Ruler, the judge of the Holy Grail War. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I will stand in your way Gilles de Rais! 
 
**Gilles:**
Then you are my enemy now. 
 
**Gilles:**
Let us finish this Jeanne d'Arc, savior of France&mdash;! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Let us indeed! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, I've confirmed the presence of the Grail. Your orders! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is the last battle. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Get ready. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! Moving to recover the Grail! Mash Kyrielight&ndash;here I go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilles:**
Not, possible! Even with the power of the Grail, I still...fell...
 
**Gilles:**
That's not possible! Such nonsense can't be true! I-I am still...
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles. Enough. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Get some rest. You did such a good job. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Believing in a little girl who had no clue, you even liberated this town. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...No matter who you are now, I believe in who you were back then. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Don't worry. Until the very end, I have no regrets. 
 
**Jeanne:**
My death will light the way for someone else. That's all I ever wanted. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Now let's go back to the time where we belong. 
 
**Gilles:**
...Jeanne. I'm the only one of us who should go to Hell&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Grail recovery is complete! The timeline restoration is about to start! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rayshift preparations are ready! Get back here, now! 
 
**Mash:**
Understood Doctor! 
 
**Jeanne:**
You're leaving? So soon? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have work to do. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have to go. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh do you? Hmmph...Well, I've achieved my goal, so I suppose it's fine. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Goodbye Little Puppy, you fought fairly well. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
&ndash;Oh my, this is goodbye? Don't worry Master. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
I can be rather persistent. No matter where you go, I'll follow. 
 
**Kiyohime:**
That's what love is, after all.... You know? 
 
**Kiyohime:**
Farewell. 
 
**Siegfried:**
...It seems that everything is over. The wyverns are disappearing. 
 
**Georgios:**
This wasn't exactly a normal Holy Grail War. But still, it was an honor to fight with the Dragon Slayer. 
 
**Siegfried:**
I never thought I'd get a chance to fight with the famous St. George. 
 
**Georgios:**
But from the look of things, it won't be long before we're summoned again. 
 
**Siegfried:**
Yes, that Master's journey seems to be a long one. I hope we can aid them again&ndash;
 
**Amadeus:**
My role is finally over, huh? I'm so tired. I worked so hard my butt hurts. 
 
**Amadeus:**
...Oh, I'm not supposed to make those sort of jokes. Sorry. 
 
**Amadeus:**
Excellent conducting nonetheless, Fujimaru. A masterful performance all around. 
 
**G：Gilles:**
Jeanne! 
 
**Jeanne:**
Gilles! 
 
**G：Gilles:**
What happened? Wait, you're alive? 
 
**G：Gilles:**
France is in ruins, but...If you're alive, that's enough! 
 
**Jeanne:**
...No, that's not true. 
 
**G：Gilles:**
What&ndash;? 
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm sure on some level you understand. This world is nothing but an ephemeral dream. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I died, and you&ndash;sorrowed. That is history. That is unchangeable fate. 
 
**G：Gilles:**
Jeanne...
 
**Jeanne:**
But in a different form, in a different way, we'll be able to fight together...I can feel it. 
 
**Jeanne:**
So this is but a temporary goodbye. 
 
**G：Gilles:**
You truly are...No, even in death, you still care for this country...
 
**G：Gilles:**
Forgive us, Jeanne d'Arc! We...France betrayed you! 
 
**G：Gilles:**
Ooooohh! 
 
**Jeanne:**
It's all right. Let's at least leave this world with a smile. 
 
**Mash:**
Master...It's time. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Master and Mash. 
 
**Jeanne:**
I expect that my meeting with you Mash,and Fujimaru, our battles, even the lives we lost...
 
**Jeanne:**
All of this will disappear, won't it? That makes me a little sad. 
 
**Jeanne:**
...Of course, it's a joyous thing that lives lost will return to us. 
 
**Jeanne:**
But I feel like I'll meet you again somewhere. My intuition can be pretty good, you know? 
 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Farewell. And thank you. 
 
**Jeanne:**
Even if all this disappears beyond the void, I'm sure something will&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Welcome back Mash, Fujimaru! Good work! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thanks to you, the first Grand Order was completed successfully. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Yes, excellent job. We had few supplies, no personnel...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...and the Rayshift was still at an experimental stage, yet you both did such a fine job. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I say this on behalf of all surviving members of Chaldea...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You are now full-grown Mages, and Chaldea is very proud of you! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fooou! 
 
**Mash:**
...Fou made it back too. Are we sure it's not a lucky animal of some sort? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, welcome back. You guys look tired. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Here's your latest observation records. Take a look, Doctor. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm...Oooohh! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We did it! 15th century France is restored completely! Still six to go, but&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Part of human history is in its rightful place! We did it, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. But Doctor&ndash;we never saw Lev Lainur. 
 
**Mash:**
He was not in France? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, he's probably hiding in one of the other 6 eras.... No, I guess he wouldn't hide. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He has more than enough power. If he's in the same time as us, he'll act. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I'm sure we'll see him eventually. Until then, we need to get stronger. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, details like that don't matter! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's the end of our mission for today! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I bet you want a warm bed and a shower, right? Go back to your room and rest. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, that plan sounds absolutely wonderful. See you later Doctor. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, and Senpai...
 
**Mash:**
Good work today. Let's get back to it tomorrow! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You too Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, thank you. 
 
**Mash:**
Once again, I wasn't able to help you at all...
 
**Mash:**
But I'm finally starting to think I can do this. 
 
**Mash:**
Together, I think we can make it through the next six eras. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You feeling okay? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, just fine. 
 
**Mash:**
A Demi-Servant's body has incredible strength,endurance, and self-healing abilities. 
 
**Mash:**
I'll be back to top health in just a short while. 
 
**Mash:**
You need to rest though, get some sleep. 
 
**Mash:**
Maybe you should have the Doctor take a look at you, he is a doctor after all. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Need something? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
No, I was just thinking of Gilles de Rais. 
 
**Mash:**
I knew his history, or so I thought. His heart was broken by Jeanne's death...
 
**Mash:**
In our history, he became a murderer who killed hundreds of children. 
 
**Mash:**
...That bloody France was what he wanted. It was an appropriate sight for a murderer. 
 
**Mash:**
But still, even then&ndash;His real wish was for Jeanne d'Arc to live. 
 
**Mash:**
That was the source of his rage, and his hatred. A pure rage that could destroy a country&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Raw feelings are powerful, aren't they? They can destroy the world&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He was human, after all. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Because he was human. Amadeus said something similar, right? 
 
**Mash:**
...I don't have the experience they do. I don't have those deep feelings, or a heart that can handle them. 
 
**Mash:**
But I'd like to learn them if I could. Even if I don't understand, I can learn a little at a time. 
 
**Mash:**
I think that's what Amadeus was talking about. 
 
**Mash:**
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. 
 
**Mash:**
Sweet dreams. May the blessing of the Saint be upon us.
