## Prelude
 
**Woman:**
Hah...Hah...Hah...
 
**Woman:**
What is this fog? My body...is losing...more and more...strength...
 
**Woman:**
Not only that...
 
**Woman:**
All this time...Something's been...chasing me all this time! 
 
**E：???:**
&mdash;I'm sorry. 
 
**Woman:**
Huh? Wh-When did you...get in front...of me? O-Oh...
 
**Woman:**
...N-No...Stay away...
 
**Woman:**
Oooh, no, don't come near me...I don't know you...What are you...WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU! 
 
**E：???:**
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry. 
 
**E：???:**
But I want to go home...I want to go home, go home, go home, go home, so...
 
**E：???:**
We...We really, really...want to go home, okay? 
 
**Woman:**
Eek! No, please stop&mdash; Stop, stop, stop, stop! 
 
**Woman:**
What's that thing you're holding!? Stop it...Please...Just don't come...near me! 
 
**E：???:**
I'm sorry. 

**--SECTION BREAK--**
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai.... You're looking quite pale today. 
 
**Mash:**
You couldn't sleep at all? That's no good,you must get plenty of rest while you're in Chaldea. 
 
**Mash:**
Rest is also an important part of our mission. Like I told you before, we are&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Senpai? 
 
**Mash:**
Perhaps...You had...a dream? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I had a scary dream. 
 
**Mash:**
...So you did have a dream. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
What kind of dream was it? It's just a guess, but...could it be my...Um...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The dream was like a horror movie. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't really remember. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I see. That's good to hear...
 
**Mash:**
No. No, it's nothing. The meeting's about to start,so let's go to the Control Room. 
 
**Mash:**
You've had breakfast already, right? Then let's go, the Doctor is waiting. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good morning, everybody. Good timing. We just finished prepping. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's start with the analysis of information from last time. 
 
**Mash:**
Observing the era of King Solomon, where a summoning spell called the 72 Demon Gods was used, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right. Let me start with the result...There was nothing wrong with King Solomon's era. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Singularities could not be observed around the 10th century BC. Basically what that means is...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Unfortunately, as Romani says, those who called themselves the 72 Demon Gods had nothing to do with King Solomon. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why is that? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, how do I put it...Think of it like a mystery novel,one where the suspect's alibi stands. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good morning, Da Vinci. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey, good morning! Someone that can actually greet people! Fujimaru, you're a fine Master! 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If King Solomon had used the 72 Demon Gods,we definitely would have detected it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Or at least seen signs that he released his 72 Demon Gods toward the future from 10th Century B. C. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But there was nothing unusual during King Solomon's time. Which means his era remains part of correct human history. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Therefore&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Lev Lainur and those calling themselves Demon Gods appeared from a completely different era. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
So, King Solomon has nothing to do with them. Well, of course&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...That's not the case if King Solomon had been serving someone else as a Servant, right? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Correct. Like Fujimaru,one can simply use Solomon as a familiar in his own era. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That way, one could also control the "72 Demon Gods. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sigh. Using the 72 Demon Gods as familiars...But that's assuming those things really existed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Besides, I don't think King Solomon is the kind of person that would aid such evil. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even if he was so in life...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Servants obey their Masters...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Forgive me, Doctor. But it's a Servant's nature to obey their Master. 
 
**Mash:**
As long as it's the Master's command, then King Solomon would have no choice but to obey, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Such a villain couldn't summon Solomon. It's not like the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chaldea's Summoning System comes into effect only if the Master and Heroic Spirit both agree to it. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, you do have a point. I came to Chaldea because I agreed to. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
The director back then was a fine mage. I agreed to the contract because I could trust them. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I told you before, didn't I? I'm Chaldea's third successful summon. It's definitely worth noting! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you're Servant No. 3? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who was the first? 
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
No. 2 is right in front of you. It's Mash. As for No. 1, no one knows at this point. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
No. 1 and No. 2 are treated as confidential matters. Only the previous director knew the details. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai. The Heroic Spirit who rescued me is No. 2.... Not that I know his True Name or skills. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Director Marie didn't even know about No. 1, either. The previous director kept all of No. 1's data under wraps. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Now that I think about it, perhaps the previous director's death wasn't an accident, but a murder. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's likely that Lev disliked the successful No. 1&mdash;No, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System itself, so much so that he killed the previous director. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, but I think No. 1 ended in failure. Since even Mash's Heroic Spirit No. 2 ended as an incomplete summon. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
For Chaldea, completely successful Heroic Spirit summons started with me, No. 3. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Also, No. 1's existence itself is suspicious. I think No. 1 may have been summoned by accident. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's because Fate, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System's foundation, was at long last proven with No. 2's help and&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahem! Ms. Leonardo, we're going to start the Rayshift soon, so would you mind getting it ready? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Whoops, a slip of my tongue. Well, that's it for me♪
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Now, in any case, for the remaining four Singularities...It's possible the mastermind lurks in one of these eras. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
After all, there are no abnormalities in any other era. If we crush each Singularity, we'll find the culprit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now let me explain the details of our Order this time. The Fourth Singularity is in the 19th century&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of the seven, it's the Singularity closest to modern times. But no need to be surprised. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is a time when civilizations rise and flourish. In this era, mankind makes huge strides. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;In other words, the Industrial Revolution! It's a definitive turning point in mankind's history. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even from the standpoint of a consumer society,this is when mankind makes a huge leap towards modern times. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Your specific destination will be the dazzling, lavish British Empire. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Surprisingly, it's specific to the capital, London. This differs from the widespread approach of the other Singularities. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe this time, you won't have to walk yourselves to death. After all, there are carriages and trains. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That is, of course, if you can manage to use them. Since some abnormalities have been detected...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Soon, the Singularity that is 19th century London will be incinerated. It will vanish. You must stop it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Find the Holy Grail,and correct the Fourth Singularity. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. So we'll be working inside the city this time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, that's right. Lucky you! London, the city of fog...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If only I could go with you all. Please get Sherlock Holmes's autograph if you see him. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor. This isn't a vacation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
R-Right. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, one more thing. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm guessing it will be hard to get his autograph. I'm sorry, but please give up. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right...Wait, Mash, you too? 
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are you a Holmes fan, too? Isn't he the best? The world's best detective, the little gray cells! 
 
**Mash:**
That's Hercule Poirot. He appears in books written by Agatha Christie. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh...Th-That's right. Okay. Let's get back on track. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, are you ready? The world hasn't been incinerated yet, so go reclaim our future! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mission...start! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's be cautious this time. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...
 
**Announcement A:**
All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation. 
 
## Section 1: London, The City of Demonic Fog 
 
**Mash:**
Rayshift successful.... It seems we can't see very well in our current conditions. 
 
**Mash:**
Fog? No, could it be smoke? It's extremely dense...
 
**Mash:**
In the sky...I can see the same "Circle of Light" as before. But...
 
**Mash:**
...with all this fog and pollution, it's obscured&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fog and smoke engulfing the sky? That's fairly common for the Industrial Revolution...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...but this doesn't look like your typical fog or smoke. I'm picking up an abnormal amount of magical energy readings. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's dense. Very dense. Really dense. No, this may be a little too dense! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's like the atmosphere is saturated with magical energy! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's poisonous to life-forms, this fog...Mash, Fujimaru, how are you feeling? 
 
**Mash:**
There's nothing wrong with me. Probably because I'm a Demi-Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
How about you, Senpai? You don't seem...any different than usual. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Same as always. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Good to hear. But try not to enter that dense fog if you can. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru is okay...Huh. Indeed, there are no significant vital sign changes. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm a bit surprised. I have the analysis result of that fog...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm positive it's harmful to organisms. It would threaten a normal human's life if they breathed it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mages, monsters, Servants, and Phantasmals have innate magic resistance, so for them it's a different story...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So of course Mash is fine. But how is Fujimaru all right...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm...I wonder. Maybe it's a poison-resistance skill? 
 
**Mash:**
Really? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It could be part of Mash's benefits, or rather,the benefits of the Heroic Spirit Mash fused with. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe the Servant that fused with Mash has high poison resistance, or a strong blessing skill...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...and its protection extends to the Master. That could be why Fujimaru is safe. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm happy to be of use to Senpai,but it seems strange to call it a "skill. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, Fujimaru is human, after all. We'll call it "Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary)," then. 
 
**Mash:**
I-I see..."Temporary," is it...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For now. London, has turned into a city of death enveloped by a magical fog. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
How does it look around there? Do you see any victims? 
 
**Mash:**
No, Doctor. It's completely deserted. 
 
**Mash:**
It's currently 2: 00 p. m. , but there's not a single carriage or even a pedestrian in sight. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't see any victims. There's just nobody here. 
 
**Mash:**
It's like an abandoned city...
 
**Mash:**
Also, as far as we can see from the street, all the doors and windows of the buildings are shut tight. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
After people started falling victim to the fog,the survivors must have taken refuge indoors...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've also detected multiple life readings in the surrounding buildings. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're likely survivors. No doubt they're in trouble being trapped indoors. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We need to solve this problem at once. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do what we can. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. You're right, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
If we obtain and destroy the Holy Grail, the existence of this abnormal London will be corrected too. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure that applies to all the residents who lost their lives because of this fog...
 
**Mash:**
...and those who are indoors, taking shelter from the fog. Everyone, basically. 
 
**Mash:**
If Senpai and I can bring things under control here,all phenomena related to the magical fog should disappear. 
 
**Mash:**
It'll be as if there were no damage or harm at all. So, um...You see, what I'm trying to say is...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash is trying to say: "Senpai is a nice person. " Right? 
 
**Mash:**
......
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Um, should I have not said that? Wait, did I say something wrong? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Wait a minute. Vital reaction detected. 
 
**E：???:**
...Who the hell are you guys? 
 
**Mash:**
Ah...Umm, w-we're, uh&mdash;
 
**E：???:**
You're breathing in a place with that dense fog without croaking. You obviously aren't ordinary humans. 
 
**E：???:**
So, which is it? Friend, or foe? 
 
**Mash:**
(I could ask the same question...Doctor, is she human? Or maybe...)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I see, I'm also wondering the same! There's too much magical energy in the area. I can't get a clear reading. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(But look at that armor. She's definitely not a typical London citizen. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I thought things would be easier since we're limited to a city. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(This has gotten quite troublesome! We have no clue who or what she is! )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(An ordinary person who happens to have magical resistance? A mage? Or, maybe a Servant&mdash;)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't tell at all! What do I do!? Argh, I'm so disorientated here! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I've never seen this kind of fog before...Ah, help me, Magi☆Mari! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"London's fog is worse than rumored. What am I supposed to do? "...There. )
 
**Mash:**
(Calm down, Doctor. The situation won't improve by consulting internet idols! )
 
**E：???:**
What are you sneaking around for? If you're not going to attack, well, whatever. 
 
**E：???:**
I have nothing to do here. Sorry to bother you. 
 
**E：???:**
The fog is dense around here. You'd better move if you value your life. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for the warning. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll do that. 
 

---

 
**E：???:**
Hmm? Yeah. Well, see you. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
She's gone...The alley to the north...Right into the dense fog, all alone, confident. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, she left during our huddle? She's so impatient. I wonder if she's a London girl. 
 
**Mash:**
That was a "huddle? "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It sounded like she knew what was going on. She probably knows more than us about the current situation in London. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's follow her. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Gathering data is important. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. Let's go after her. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I was just about to say that. But then she just had to go and disappear on me. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor...Doctor Roman. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, sorry. All right, time to get moving. I'll keep careful watch! 
 
**Mash:**
...What is that? I can hear something. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No vital reactions, but I detect multiple moving bodies! The fog still obscures magical readings, so I can't get any! 
 
**Mash:**
The sound is approaching. It's close. Master! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Multiple targets closing in at high speed. Assume they're hostile. Break through before you're surrounded! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good judgment will be even more important here&mdash;Fujimaru, be careful! 
 
**Mash:**
Preparing for battle. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;We made it through. Somehow we were able to move without being surrounded. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Who knew something like that would be lurking in the fog? No wonder nobody's emerged from any buildings. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Since no doors or windows seem to be kicked in,that must mean they don't break into houses, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Strange. They're really quite strange. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. What bizarre enemies...No, I don't think they were living creatures. 
 
**Mash:**
We'll call them enemy bodies for now. They're likely automata animated by magecraft. 
 
**Mash:**
The structure of their remains seems familiar. Some parts are machinery from this era, too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-I see...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sorry. I won't be able to give you any advance warning. All of my magical detection readings are in a state of chaos. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I only have motion detection at best. Hmm, this is quite concerning. 
 
**Mash:**
I feel the same. It's just like the city itself...
 
**Mash:**
Fog, smoke. It's like there's a layer of mist around everything...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At any rate, we have to act more cautiously than before. All right, let's go after that girl. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes...Senpai, let's go. 
 
## Section 2: Knight of Londinium 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Detecting multiple entities! Here they come! They're around the corner! 
 
**Mash:**
...It's the same sound as before. Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's drive them away! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Hmm. It's like...a presence...What is this feeling? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The girl from earlier? Is she nearby? London girls are quite quick on their feet, aren't they. 
 
**Mash:**
No, there are multiple readings. But they're silent...They're not puppets? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, they might be different. They move differently. But this feeling...They're definitely enemies. Here they come! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
All enemies defeated. Good work, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
They don't seem to be puppets. But...I can't say for sure if they are humans, either. 
 
**Mash:**
I believe these enemies...are a kind of...Well, homunculus. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Homunculus? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A kind of human created by magecraft, right? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. An artificial human created with magecraft. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Were you hurt? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
No...I'm fine, Senpai, thank you. There's no need to worry. I carefully monitor my physical condition. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry. I'm probably a little on edge because of the unusual environment we're in. 
 
**Mash:**
I need to learn how to adapt to any situation. I'm your Demi-Servant, after all. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Okay. I'm starting to get the hang of this. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor? Have you detected anything? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. It could be because they're mechanical,but I'm positive they're hostile. Multiple enemies approaching! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger. Master, prepare for battle. Waiting for orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
All enemies destroyed. There are none left as far as I can see. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't detect anything else from here either. Okay, continue on ahead...Wait, hold on. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've detected a single, large unit. Easy to make out. It's too large to be human! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I doubt it's a large vehicle. Mash, do you sense anything? 
 
**Mash:**
...I can hear machinery operating. It's large! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It would have been a rather romantic story if Britain's secret service had arranged for a special vehicle...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...or if this era's Mage's Association had sent a mechanical golem to save the citizens of London. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I doubt that's the case here! It's clearly an enemy,and it's approaching you! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, be on your guard. It's probably a new type of enemy. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's fight cautiously. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, we just have to take our chances! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Enemy contact now! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...All enemy movements have ceased. 
 
**Mash:**
It was powerful...But what was it, exactly? A golem? A mechanical puppet? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A robot...
 
**Mash:**
It looks...that way...I guess you could see it that way, yes...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was so cool! 
 
**Mash:**
Cool? It looked like a walking tin can to me...Well,I guess the definition of cool is subjective...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's problematic that I can't detect any magical energy. Mash, are there any enemies remaining? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If any enemy parts are exposed, send me some images. I'll analyze them when I have the time. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. I'll send the visual data after filming. 
 
**Mash:**
Hmm...
 
**Mash:**
It's bizarre...This mechanical armor is corroding in some places. 
 
**Mash:**
It seems fine for the most part, but areas that seem to be made of metal have...corroded...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, did we use any acid attacks in the last battle? Wait, do we have any Servants of that sort? 
 
**Mash:**
During the Industrial Revolution in London, massive amounts of smoke emitted from steam engines was a big social problem. 
 
**Mash:**
The sulfurous gases in the smoke got caught in the cold fog, retaining and concentrating into a fog of sulfuric acid...
 
**Mash:**
...Hmm. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Is something the matter, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
No. Please wait..."Something like inhaling sulfuric acid? " Yes, that's it...
 
**Mash:**
Some records from before...Should be...
 
**Mash:**
Yes. That's right. I mean, this era&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, behind you! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hey, who are you! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
!? 
 
**Mash:**
...Ah! 
 
**Mash:**
I'm under attack! An ambush? I didn't sense anything! 
 
**G：???:**
...Hey, what are you, exactly? A human? Or a mage? 
 
**G：???:**
You're moving unhindered within the magical fog,and you seem just fine within "our fog" as well. 
 
**G：???:**
I guess you're just like us. 
 
**Mash:**
So you're a Servant. You're supposed to be a human from this era, though...
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Jack the Ripper. 
 
**Mash:**
An infamous serial killer who not only killed many women in London at the end of the 19th century, but who also dismembered them...
 
**Mash:**
...and directly challenged Scotland Yard. The symbol of terror that swept across England, no, all of Europe, at the time. 
 
**Jack:**
You know about us? Hmm, that pleases me...How very nice...In that case...
 
**Jack:**
You're aware, then, of what we'll do to you? Oh, I'm so very, very happy! 
 
**Jack:**
I'm so...HAPPY! 
 
**Mash:**
She's coming at us! Master, your orders! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The motion response is gone. Either they retreated or are hiding within the fog. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. That was a dangerous, hostile Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
From the area analysis I did during the battle, a part of this fog is likely from the Noble Phantasm of that Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But the fog of magical energy that covers London is something else entirely. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In short, it was a combination of the two fogs. We've got a really difficult opponent on our hands...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The fog contains such a high density of sulfuric acid that there's no way this is a normal phenomenon. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also...And this is the most troubling aspect, Mash...
 
**Mash:**
I know. My memory seems to have been altered. We just fought...and yet...
 
**Mash:**
...the memory of my opponent is a blur. 
 
**Mash:**
I only remember one thing. It was a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
The form, the name, and...There's some other memory related to it, but...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. Seems like the effect can transcend eras. My memory is kind of vague, too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At this rate, the observation record may be distorted,too. What a strange Noble Phantasm it is...
 
**Mash:**
Speaking of bizarre&mdash;That's right. Doctor, we, um...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We were filming...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about the giant robot from earlier? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Ah! That's right. We were filming. Senpai, I'm sorry...Thank you. 
 
**Mash:**
It seems the effect on your memory is weak, Senpai. Lucky for us! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right! Yup. Right. I received it. I received image data for a mysterious robot. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm going to proceed in analyzing these images. I wonder what it is? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It doesn't look like a golem that runs on magical energy,but it also doesn't look like a complete machine...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, are you versed in mechanical engineering? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm no expert, but I am a member of Chaldea. Albeit as medical staff. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, this is...Don't tell me we've just come across some lost steam engine technology. 
 
**E：???:**
Oh, that&mdash;? 
 
**E：???:**
It's just a clump of steel, right? We call it...
 
**E：???:**
&mdash;Helter Skelter. 
 
**Mash:**
You are&ndash;
 
**E：???:**
I've been watching you. You destroyed one of them,which means you're probably not my enemy. 
 
**E：???:**
Besides, you fought well, not bad. Considering you probably have no idea about the circumstances. 
 
**E：???:**
Very nice. I rather like fools like that. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can I ask you a question? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who are you calling a fool!? 
 

---

 
**E：???:**
Say what? 
 
**Mash:**
You're right. I'm sure we're not your enemy. 
 
**Mash:**
Please...Can you give us some information. Will you speak with us? 
 
**Mash:**
What's happening in this foggy city? 
 
**E：???:**
Very well. I'll talk to you. 
 
**E：???:**
But first, let me get one thing straight. You're a Demi-Servant, aren't you? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. My name is Mash Kyrielight. And I am a Demi-Servant. 
 
**E：???:**
And who are you? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm Fujimaru. 
 

---

 
**E：???:**
Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru, huh? ...I suppose that's all right. It has nothing to do with me. 
 
**E：???:**
I am Mordred. A Heroic Spirit. And&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
I'm a Knight of the Round Table, here to face the perils of Londinium, a city in Father's beloved Britain. 
 
## Section 3: The Demonic Fog Laughs 
 
**F：???:**
...Oh boy, Saber. You always reveal your True Name to strangers right away. 
 
**F：???:**
We talked about this. If you're introducing yourself, just state your class. 
 
**F：???:**
Do you understand? Disclosing your True Name is like revealing your abilities. 
 
**F：???:**
That's the reason we conceal our True Names during normal Holy Grail Wars. 
 
**F：???:**
And yet you give out your True Name at the drop of a hat...
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, what's the difference? This is no longer the "Holy Grail War" that you spoke of. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's not the one with 7 Heroic Spirits, nor the one with 14. On top of that, no Masters. Anyway, do you have any ciders? I am thirsty. 
 
**F：???:**
Wait, that's my favorite sofa...Ah well. Yes, I already got your ciders chilled and ready. 
 
**Mordred:**
Right, we do have a refrigerator before it became widely used. Being a scholar sure is useful. 
 
**F：???:**
Though I have chemicals that need to be stored at low temperatures. It's necessary for scholars. 
 
**Mordred:**
Sure, sure. 
 
**Mordred:**
(...Gulp, gulp gulp) Whew! That's the stuff. It really hits the spot coming out of that demonic fog! 
 
**Mordred:**
Mmm&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
What are you two doing? Don't just stand there. Find a place to sit. 
 
**Mordred:**
My home is your home. This is my temporary base. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, right...Senpai, what should we do? Is it all right to sit? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I suppose...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You with the glasses...Can I ask you something? 
 

---

 
**F：???:**
...Haha. Well, all right, I don't mind. If Saber trusts you, I'm sure we're on the same side. 
 
**F：???:**
I haven't introduced myself yet. I am Henry Jekyll. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I work in London as a scholar&mdash; A scientist. Though not officially a mage, I am familiar with elixirs. 
 
**Jekyll:**
One day, all of a sudden,London was blanketed by this fog. It was a nightmare. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I was able to figure out that the fog contained magical energy, but was at a loss about what to do. 
 
**Mordred:**
That's when we met and started working together. 
 
**Mordred:**
He isn't very reliable as a mage,but comes in handy in his own way. 
 
**Mordred:**
I provide the muscle. He investigates and analyzes. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Exactly. 
 
**Mash:**
Um&mdash;Excuse me. Mr. Henry Jekyll? 
 
**Mash:**
That name, um...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's the same name as a character in a novel. Coincidence? Or perhaps he was the model for that character? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, can you detect the presence of a Servant? I can't. You're inside, but you might as well be outside. 
 
**Mash:**
I can't either, Doctor. I can't tell if this presence is human or not. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I assure you, I am a genuine human. If it's a Servant you want, they're outside, investigating. 
 
**Jekyll:**
And what were you talking about? A novel? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. A book that was published a little before this era. The main character shares your name. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I don't recall that. Strange, as I do read my share of novels...
 
**Jekyll:**
The same name as the main character? Really? Hmm, I don't think I could forget that. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Well, let's set that aside. It is a very common name, after all. 
 
**Jekyll:**
&mdash;As I was saying, I am Henry Jekyll. All I want to do is stop this blight on my hometown. 
 
**Jekyll:**
But the more important matter at hand is you folks. You're slightly different from us, aren't you? 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Hmm...Singularity, huh? 
 
**Jekyll:**
One of seven bolts that were driven into the world. And...the London of this era is that bolt. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. We're searching for the Holy Grail,which we believe causes the Singularity. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I understand your situation now, more or less. Now, let me tell you of the city's circumstances that we're aware of. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Each night for the past three nights,a lethal fog has descended upon London. 
 
**Jekyll:**
If you wear a mask in an area where the fog is thin,you probably won't die from it. 
 
**Jekyll:**
But it's no good where it's thick. Normal creatures will be corrupted by the magical energy just by breathing it. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It probably depends on one's predisposition,but in the worst cases, death comes within an hour. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I don't have the exact numbers, but according to my calculations, several hundred thousand have died. 
 
**Jekyll:**
There are areas that have become ghost towns already. The East End is just about wiped out. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's only a matter of time before the entire city is nothing but ruins. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's all because of that fog. An extraordinary dense fog laced with potent magical energy&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
For now, we're calling it Demonic Fog. 
 
**Mash:**
London, covered by a deadly fog...It's slightly similar to an incident that will occur in the 20th century. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is it off by a century? That's probably what the Singularity is...But...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll look at the 20th century case, too. I had thought this was a one city deal, but it's getting pretty complicated. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's not just the Demonic Fog. You two should've engaged in combat as well. 
 
**Jekyll:**
These past three days&mdash;on top of the Demonic Fog,London has been plagued with other types of threats. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Those committing atrocities under cover of the fog. Automatas made of magecraft, killer homunculi...
 
**Jekyll:**
Helter Skelter&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
And there's a serial killer. The newspapers call them "Jack the Ripper. "
 
**Mash:**
The newspapers? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Yes, the newspapers were still being printed on the first day of the Demonic Fog...Though no longer. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Understandably, it seems neither Scotland Yard nor the government has a handle on the situation. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Government functions are already starting to freeze up. External support is hindered by the fog, isolating London. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's already been three days. A cooped-up populace won't last long. 
 
**Jekyll:**
The Demonic Fog doesn't go indoors,but once food and water runs out, London will perish. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...That's horrifying. The situation requires quick response. All right then, Mr. Jekyll and Mordred. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I have a proposal. We'd like you to help us search for the Holy Grail, the likely origin of this situation. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Nothing would suit us better. Right, Saber? 
 
**Mordred:**
Fine with me. It seems like the best thing to do. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good, this will truly help us! In more ways than one! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So&ndash; Mash and Fujimaru,lucky for us, this apartment is over a Leyline! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Excuse me? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can put a Terminal Point here. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fouuu! 
 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai and Fou. It's possible to set up a Summoning Circle in this room. 
 
**Mash:**
Maybe Mr. Jekyll knew about the Leyline and intentionally built his apartment over it? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Oh, no, I'm not a legitimate mage, so this isn't a magecraft workshop. It's just a regular room. 
 
**Jekyll:**
At any rate, feel free to use it as you please. What are you going to do? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We'll put the Servant summoning circle over the Leyline to boost Fujimaru and Mash's combat abilities. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servants summoned by the circle aren't always active,but they're a huge help during battles! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right! Let's start setting it up! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger. Creating Terminal Point&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
While they make the circle,I'll help you pass the time. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Previously, I spoke about Servant class affinity,so I think I'll expand on that. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Just as each Heroic Spirit has a story to tell, they have classifications that explain how they were born. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
There are three attributes: Heaven, Earth, and Human. Most Servants fall under one of these categories. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Heaven includes Divine Spirits demoted to Heroic Spirits,children of gods, and embodiments of legends. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Earth includes legendary heroes that took hold in the land, fairies, and Demonic Beasts. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Human is for heroes and great people who actually existed. I'm included in this group, as a great artist who actually existed. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Heaven wins over Earth, but loses to Human. Earth wins over Human, but loses to Heaven. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
And Human wins over Heaven, but loses to Earth. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Humans believe in gods. However,gods that they stop believing in become "nonexistent. "
 
**Da Vinci:**
Native heroes and fairies have nothing to do with faith. However, they are no match for the gods that created them. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...And there are rare, special Heroic Spirits that do not belong in any of the three attributes. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
They are an exception of exceptions. &ndash;The Heroic Spirits of the Star. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
They do not belong to Heaven, Earth, or Human. Yet they exist on earth under heaven, and are born of humans. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Servants of the Star have nothing to do with Heaven,Earth, or Humans. After all, they're an exception. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That said, these are nothing more than categories. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
The effects aren't as pronounced as Class affinity,so it's not worth integrating into a strategy. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...And that wraps up this session. Summoning circle setup complete. Good luck in this era, too! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you, Da Vinci, thank you! Thank you yet again! 
 
**Jekyll:**
Who was that just now? She was beautiful,but...She wasn't actually here, was she? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fouuu! 
 
**Jekyll:**
???
 
**Mordred:**
...Mmm. I remember seeing him somewhere before. Phantasmal? 
 
**Fou:**
F-Fouuuu...
 
**Mash:**
Fou? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Perhaps a rare animal from around Africa? Anyway,Saber, and this concerns Mash and Fujimaru, too. 
 
**Jekyll:**
This is abrupt&ndash;but I would like to ask you three to do something. 
 
**Mordred:**
We just got back and we have to go out into the Demonic Fog again? Good grief. 
 
**Mash:**
I apologize for asking you to lead the way. It's just that we're not used to London yet. 
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry. If you guys hadn't come here,this work would've had to be all mine. 
 
**Mordred:**
If anything, I should be thanking you. Sorry for making you come along based on vague information. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, no, Mordred. Not at all...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Protecting one of Mr. Jekyll's other collaborators,the Swiss scholar Mr. Frankenstein, huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Seems he's been unreachable since this morning. Do you normally communicate with each other via radio? 
 
**Mordred:**
Jekyll does. He calls it his information network. I don't really understand it. 
 
**Mordred:**
He has collaborators all over the city and chats with them on the radio every day. 
 
**Mordred:**
Old man Victor was safe until yesterday at least. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Victor Frankenstein, huh...Just when we thought it's another character from a novel, it turns out to be his "relative. "
 
**Mash:**
The grandchild of the mage that became the model character in the novel, was what Mr. Jekyll mentioned. 
 
**Mash:**
Unexpected, indeed. In Mary Shelly's novel...
 
**Mash:**
Dr. Frankenstein was a scientist. But the person he was modeled after was a real-life mage. 
 
**Mash:**
It brings to mind that idiom about how "truth is stranger than fiction". 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it that strange? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are scientists and mages really that different? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Strictly speaking,magecraft and science are contrary to each other. 
 
**Mash:**
Chaldea's existence is an extreme exception, and if you think about it, both globally and historically&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh yes, but everything has an exception. In a certain era,science and magecraft virtually meant the same thing. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For example, even if you set aside ancient times,some will say alchemy is the origin of chemistry. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are numerous examples of mages who are known as renowned scientists, chemists, and scholars. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You know,Da Vinci is one such example. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Mmm. You called? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, you're talking about science and magecraft. I'm no help there. After all...
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm almighty. You can't compare me to anyone. Too bad. Bye. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah! We lost the connection. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's with her, anyway? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Da Vinci is way too carefree...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I know...
 
**Mordred:**
We're near Soho. Keep your guard up now. They'll be here soon. 
 
**Mordred:**
The edge of the City Area where Jekyll's apartment is seems relatively peaceful in comparison. 
 
**Mordred:**
This area is no good. We're in their territory. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So it appears. I'm picking up multiple motion signals. It'll be a fight, so watch out! 
 
**Mash:**
Right. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...Damn. They're coming again. I wish I could unleash my Noble Phantasm at will. 
 
**Mash:**
We're inside the city. I'm sorry, but you must get your temper under control. 
 
**Mordred:**
I know that, Shieldy. Ugh, somehow I feel weird when you tell me that. 
 
**Mash:**
Hold on. "Shieldy? "Are you referring to me? 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? You have a shield, don't you? You use it to defend and bash people in the face. 
 
**Mordred:**
Or, does "Ms. Shieldy" sound better? I don't care which one you pick. 
 
**Mash:**
...That's okay. Just call me "Shieldy," please...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy is trying to flank us from both sides. Can you take care of the right side, Saber Mordred? 
 
**Mordred:**
Leave it to me. I usually deal with everything by myself. 
 
**Mordred:**
Are you ready over there, Fujimaru? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, I'm ready! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Strike foes from the left! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Roger. Entering battle with hostiles! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second? 
 
**Mash:**
I, um...
 
**Mordred:**
What? Speak up. If you have something to say, just say it. 
 
**Mash:**
All right, then. 
 
**Mash:**
I have a question for you. Why are you fighting here? 
 
**Mash:**
Mr. Jekyll is fighting to protect his hometown. But what about you&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
I already told you, didn't I? I'm here to face the perils of Father's beloved Londinium. 
 
**Mash:**
Well, sure...I mean...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I did hear that when we first met. I understand that, really, but...
 
**Mash:**
I hope you won't get upset, but for some reason,I...I feel like...it's for a different reason. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Jeez. 
 
**Mordred:**
All right. I didn't even tell Jekyll about this, you know? 
 
**Mordred:**
I just&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Yes, that's right. I just can't allow the land of Britain to be violated by someone other than me. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'm the only one allowed to violate the land King Arthur loved. I can't let anyone else do that. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So distorted...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Hm? Did you say something? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, not at all. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not particularly. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
If you want to say something, say it. Well, anyway...
 
**Mordred:**
Don't worry. I will give you the Holy Grail once we find it. 
 
**Mordred:**
I won't say "I want it after all" or anything. And even if I did, it wouldn't serve any purpose. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'm Mordred, the Treacherous Knight. But this time it's special, and I'll be on the defender's side. 
 
**Mordred:**
Honestly, I was hesitating a bit. Meeting you guys cleared up my mind. 
 
**Mash:**
What do you mean? 
 
**Mordred:**
I mean, someone worthy of being the owner finally showed up. You can have the Holy Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Mordred:**
Enough chitchat. Don't bring up this topic ever again. 
 
**Mordred:**
We're almost at the mansion, but enemies are here again. Well then, shall we rip them apart? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mordred's detection is amazing. Is it an Intuition skill? We detected hostile reactions too. There'll be three waves! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger. Master, orders please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
All right, we're here. This big building is Victor's mansion. 
 
**Mordred:**
Unlike Jekyll who's half-assed,he is a genuine mage, so be careful. 
 
**Mordred:**
Traps like barriers and such are set up all over, so even Servants get hurt if they touch things without knowing. 
 
**Mordred:**
When I first visited to check things out,I had an absolutely terrible experience here. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, okay. I'll be careful, then. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A death trap workshop in an urban area...Sounds like a cautious old guy with pretty strong nerves. 
 
**Mordred:**
The first challenge is the entrance door. See, look at that big door&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Damn, we're too late. 
 
**Mash:**
Someone is at the entrance...A tall silhouette...A clown? 
 
**Mordred:**
Hey, you! Scarecrow! Or are you a living statue? Whatever! Anyway...
 
**Mordred:**
...you stink like hell. It's like blood, guts, and fire. 
 
**Mordred:**
And the catalyst for the old man's favorite elemental spell? I can smell it from here! 
 
**Mordred:**
You killed him, didn't you. You murdered Victor Frankenstein. 
 
**???:**
Yes, I did&mdash;Well, no, let me see. Just a moment, please. 
 
**???:**
Indeed, indeed. That elderly man will not open his mouth, brush his teeth, eat food, or breathe ever again. 
 
**???:**
Yes, yes. Frankly speaking, I'm certain he is dead. 
 
**???:**
It's a shame. He refused to join our cause. Right till the very end. 
 
**???:**
But, and yet, however. Who killed Victor Frankenstein? 
 
**???:**
That might be quite a difficult question to answer. Because he "blew himself up. "
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**???:**
Oh, my. Did I scare the beautiful young lady? 
 
**???:**
My apologies. As you can see, I am a demon after all&mdash;
 
**???:**
That was a joke, and I'm sorry for letting you down,but I'm actually a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**???:**
I'm a Servant just like you. The class is Caster. 
 
**???:**
...Oh? Well, folks, you don't get it? 
 
**Mordred:**
That's enough. Shut up. 
 
**???:**
No, I'm sure you got that. You wonder why I revealed my class so easily? 
 
**???:**
It is reasonable during a Holy Grail War unlike any other. At least that lady over there knows why! 
 
**???:**
An encounter instantly becomes an all-out battle! As we are Servants without Masters&mdash;
 
**???:**
We can be called the most powerful forces on the earth. However...
 
**???:**
Sadly, it seems that you have a Master. Best you protect yourself well. Otherwise, in no time...
 
**Mordred:**
Enough small talk. And wipe that grin off your face right now. 
 
**???:**
Pardon? 
 
**Mordred:**
That smirk of a smile! So annoying! Was it really that fun to kill that old man? 
 
**???:**
Well, sure&mdash;
 
**???:**
Once he rejected our cause,it was like a job to me, so to speak. 
 
**Mash:**
Cause? 
 
**???:**
When you are obligated to do something,it's usually quite a nuisance, indeed. 
 
**???:**
But still, it feels good to do your best. You will work hard for a job you enjoy. 
 
**???:**
His expression in the moment he died. The face of a human who understood the transition from life to death! 
 
**???:**
Despair! Sorrow! Ah! That is exactly it&mdash;! 
 
**???:**
Well, anyway, something like that&mdash;
 
**???:**
It killed my boredom? At least, I guess? 
 
**Mordred:**
...I see. 
 
**Mordred:**
Immigrant or not, that old man was a citizen of Britain. Listen, you took him...
 
**Mordred:**
You put your hand on "my stuff" without my permission. You know what will happen? 
 
**???:**
&mdash;What? 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;I'm saying, I'm going to kill you, dumb-ass clown! 
 
**???:**
Well, well, well! You? Killing me? Can you, really? 
 
**???:**
You seem to be a hot-blooded person! Good, that's fine. I'll try not to disappoint you then! 
 
**???:**
You might as well watch out for the explosions! My Noble Phantasm has already been set up! 
 
**???:**
By my True Name, Mephistopheles! I shall relish striking you all down into despair! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You've set up what!? Dammit! I don't know if it's because of the fog or his skill, but it's undetectable! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, hostile Servant approaching! Orders, please&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get him! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fight and watch out for his Noble Phantasm! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Roger! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mephistopheles:**
This is quite...regretful! This materialization was one I couldn't enjoy much of...
 
**Mephistopheles:**
I suppose Servants need Masters after all...Yes, the power of the bond between Master and Servant...
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Something of it...Not. Yes, definitely not. 
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Once a Master decides to fulfill an earnest wish, I must make at least one child must die by the Master's hand. 
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Otherwise you can't enjoy the best part of a Holy Grail War. Oh, I envy you, Shield Servant...
 
**Mephistopheles:**
You will have countless chances from here onwards...to betray and throw your Master into despair! 
 
**Mephistopheles:**
I am so...jealous of you! 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Shut up. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Did you find anything? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I found the note the doctor left. Apparently, he was writing this when he was attacked. 
 
**Mordred:**
I see. I must say, he was a lax old guy until the end. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'll read it out loud. 
 
**Mash:**
"I learned of a certain plot. Its name is 'Project Demonic Fog. ' Though its present state is still unknown,"
 
**Mash:**
"The three leaders of the project are 'P', 'B' and 'M', who can cast spells beyond human wisdom. Probably Heroic Spirits. "
 
**Mordred:**
Is "M" the guy from earlier? Well, let's take this back and have Jekyll read it, too. 
 
**Mordred:**
And now...I've found something interesting, too. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hey, come over here. 
 
**H：???:**
...Uh. 
 
**Mash:**
...A girl? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She has a horn. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, she does have a horn...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is she human? Or a Servant? 
 
**Mash:**
Who knows? It would be the best if we ask her. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Are you a human? Or are you a Servant just like us? 
 
**H：???:**
...Uhh. 
 
**Mash:**
? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, I can't determine what she is...All I can read is that there are vital and physical reactions. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It seems the detection issues caused by the Demonic Fog can reach indoors, too. How about you, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
I can't figure it out, either. How about you, Mordred? 
 
**Mordred:**
I can't tell for sure by just her presence. I think the Demonic Fog outside is interrupting. 
 
**Mordred:**
But, you're asking what she is? Of course she's a Servant&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
At least I wish I could say that.... In my memory, that's how it was supposed to be...
 
**Mordred:**
Anyway, yes. She is an artificial human. Apparently. 
 
**Mash:**
An artificial human&mdash;is she? 
 
**Mordred:**
I found her in the coffin in the backroom,and a note was attached. Let me see...
 
**Mordred:**
First artificial human created by Grandfather Victor Frankenstein, or something like that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So it is Frankenstein's monster. But didn't it burn up in the end according to the novel? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wonder if she can hear my voice. Let's see...Are you Frankenstein's monster? 
 
**H：???:**
...Uhh, ah...uuuh...
 
**Mordred:**
Hm? 
 
**Mash:**
It seems like she doesn't have a speech function. But I can somehow understand her. 
 
**H：???:**
......
 
**Mash:**
Name, I guess. Monster&mdash;is certainly a name you don't like, right? 
 
**H：???:**
...Uhh. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then, how about Fran? 
 

---

 
**H：???:**
...Uh...
 
**Mash:**
Ah, she seems to be happy with the name. Okay then, Ms. Fran. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...
 
**Mash:**
You are an artificial human...Is that correct? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh...
 
**Mordred:**
You're not a Servant, huh. Oh, I get it. You mean, "you're still alive. "
 
**Mordred:**
I finally understand. No wonder I couldn't figure it out just by looking at you. 
 
**Mash:**
? 
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, never mind. 
 
**Mordred:**
We can't just leave her here,so let's take her back to Jekyll. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh...
 
**Mordred:**
Your master is no longer here. You can go anywhere you want. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'll let you stay with Jekyll for now. Let's go. The fog shouldn't impact you if you're an artificial human. 
 
**Mash:**
Is she...really? I'm not so sure about that. That's a dangerous action. 
 
**Mordred:**
She's going to be fine! She's not breathing. Right, Fran? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh. 
 
**Mordred:**
See. She's nodding. 
 
## Section 4: One Book, One Pen 
 
**Jekyll:**
This girl&mdash;yes, Fran is an artificial human. Her physical composition was not of a spirit. She's not a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Jekyll:**
She is a human living in this era. Wait, I guess artificial human. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Maybe the description in the novel was wrong...Though I can't be that positive about it. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...Uh...
 
**Jekyll:**
Hmm? 
 
**Mash:**
Um, well...She's just...I mean... How can I say this...
 
**Mordred:**
You touched around her body insisting it was an inspection, and it made her unhappy. Apologize to her, Jekyll. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Oh. I'm very sorry. How shameful of me. That was unacceptable from an English gentleman. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh. 
 
**Jekyll:**
? 
 
**Mash:**
It's fine, as long as you understand...That was the nuance in her voice...I think. 
 
**Mordred:**
Most likely. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, that's what she said. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How are you guys understanding her? 
 

---

 
**Jekyll:**
How do you guys know what she thinks? Is it because you're the "same gender"...Oh, no, nothing! 
 
**Mordred:**
Next time, I will kill you. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Yes. Yup. Sorry. I'll never say it again. Anyway&mdash;another case showed up in my info network. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Something strange appeared in the Soho area. Apparently it even slips indoors to assault civilians. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let me confirm. The homunculi, automata,and Helter Skelters until now&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
Have zero cases of entering buildings. At least not according to my information network and Saber's patrols. 
 
**Jekyll:**
What is entering buildings and attacking civilians appears to be a book as big as a human. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I decided to tentatively call them Magical Tomes. I want you to deal with this. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Whether this is related to "Project Demonic Fog" is uncertain, but at the very least, there have been victims in Soho. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I need your help. Will you do it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's no use staying still. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I agree, Master. We're some of the few able to go outdoors. 
 
**Mash:**
I will try my best to be of help to you, Senpai. Rather, it would make me happy...
 
**Mordred:**
What are you talking about? Doesn't matter if you're a Demi or whatever, you're still a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Oh, I mean...Well, just forget it. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Master-Servant relationships are case-by-case. It's not something I should interfere with. 
 
**Mordred:**
Now, shall we? I don't know if Fran can be useful, so she'll stay here. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh......Uh...
 
**Mordred:**
What, are you lonely? Just be a good girl and wait. We'll be right back. 
 
**Mash:**
It's dangerous outside. Let's talk again when we come back. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh. 
 
**Mordred:**
Huge book...A Magical Tome, huh? A kind of monster that didn't exist in Britain back in my day. 
 
**Mash:**
The Britain when you were alive...Did monsters exist back in the times of the Arthurian legends? 
 
**Mordred:**
Of course. The Knights of the Round Table even fought dragons and giants. 
 
**Mordred:**
Deep woods, steep mountains, bluffs with unceasing winds. Realms humans never cross are prime dens for Phantasmals. 
 
**Mordred:**
They come down to human dwellings every so often. And well, ordinary humans usually end up as their food. 
 
**Mash:**
Food, you say. 
 
**Mordred:**
Average soldiers are no match for demonic beasts,dragons, or Phantasmals. Even in your era, most weapons are useless. 
 
**Mordred:**
But there are exceptions. For Britain&mdash;it was the Knights of the Round Table. 
 
**Mordred:**
We fought well, and killed a reasonable number,you know? Battling a Phantasmal is pretty rough&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, and them. Them...The Picts. 
 
**Mash:**
In our time, they're seen as a very mysterious people. A tribe that once flourished mainly in Scotland, so we've heard. 
 
**Mordred:**
Well, rather than people, they were...Um...
 
**Mordred:**
They weren't like any tribes or barbarians...They went far beyond any of them. 
 
**Mordred:**
Describing it in terms of your era, they were like something that would be in a sci-fi movie, you know? 
 
**Mordred:**
Aliens? Or, something like that. Yes, that's a close one. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An Arthurian joke? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ah, that's a funny joke. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. I heard it as a joke, too.... Oh. 
 
**Mash:**
Mordred, I...I'm sorry. I completely missed the timing to laugh. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, that was an Arthurian joke? So you're supposed to miss the timing...Hm, I see. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Mordred:**
Joke? No, I wasn't joking at all&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Wait, I sense enemies. Most of them are automatas. 
 
**Mash:**
...It's a battle. Master, your orders please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Mordred:**
Crushed the dolls. There. 
 
**Mordred:**
But&mdash;What is this sort of thing even called? 
 
**Mordred:**
In Asia they have a term for it, don't they? "En" or something. It's like fate? 
 
**Mordred:**
Gathering all sorts of Heroic Spirits and making them your allies&mdash;That's not something you can achieve easily. 
 
**Mordred:**
But well, if that's the way you're using the summons I guess it's possible. 
 
**Mordred:**
This method should indeed make Heroic Spirit summons easier. I can imagine who it was that suggested it. 
 
**Mordred:**
To be honest, it feels strange to me......But that, I suppose, is also fate. 
 
**Mash:**
? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is Mordred talking about? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it about the summoning system? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes...It seems so, anyways. Are you talking about the Heroic Spirit Summoning System? 
 
**Mash:**
Um...Mordred, do you know much about Heroic Spirit summons? Like you're a Saber with magecraft knowledge? 
 
**Mordred:**
What did you just say, Shieldy? Do I have magecraft knowledge? Are you being sarcastic or...
 
**Mordred:**
...Wait, that's not what you meant, huh. Argh, you're such a pain in the ass, Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes...! I don't know why I just got scolded,but in any case I'm very sorry! 
 
**Mordred:**
I'm not scolding, it's just a complaint! That's another thing you two have in common! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
"You two? "
 
**Mordred:**
...Forget it. That was a slip of the tongue. Don't probe any further, Fujimaru. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Touchy, aren't you? 
 
**Mordred:**
Of course, I am. Being cranky is my default mode. It's 'cause I'm a mass killer, as far from a saint as one can be. 
 
**Mordred:**
You guys are the ones that are getting too close in the first place. People are normally scared of me, being the Treacherous Knight and all. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Mordred:**
...Tch! Look, you guys aren't the problem here, okay? It's my own nature that's the problem. 
 
**Mordred:**
So don't misunderstand me. It's not that I hate either Mash or Fujimaru. I don't hate you, that's not it, but&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
I can't help myself. Come on, let's fight. Get that shield up. I'll batter it to pieces. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You ARE upset! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Treacherous Berserker! 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, insult me all you want. I'm used to it. Feels better than awkward compliments. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't let Mash engage in needless battles. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To fight Mash, go through me first
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, so you CAN act like a Master. Though it would've looked a lot cooler if your knees weren't shaking, you know? 
 
**Mordred:**
The weak should act like one and stay back. Because they meddle in things like that, they're the first to die, yeah? 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;! Master, get back! Mordred is serious! 
 
**Mordred:**
You parried my first attack! How cheeky! You're finally learning how to use that thing the way you should! 
 
**Mordred:**
That's good. Here goes, Shieldy! You must always be one step ahead of your own limit to protect your allies! 
 
**Mordred:**
If you're gonna use that Noble Phantasm, put some spirit in it! As an experienced Servant, I will train you thoroughly! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Hah...Ah...Ugh...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Sen...pai&mdash; Thank goodness. Were you watching? 
 
**Mash:**
Battle...is over&mdash;I...was able to parry...Mordred's attacks&mdash;
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mordred! 
 
**Mordred:**
Oof...Don't glare at me like that. I regret that I went a little overboard. You seriously look scary right now. 
 
**Mordred:**
Don't worry, that was a mock fight. Mash was fully aware of that too. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
So, how was it, Mash? Figured out how to use that Noble Phantasm at least a little bit? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes...Thank you...Very much...Somehow, it feels&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...like a shackle on my heart was removed...That was the toughest I've felt since Cú Chulainn's spells...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then perhaps...that just now was? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
...Well, drastic times call for drastic measures. 
 
**Mordred:**
She was holding herself back by calling herself a Demi-Servant. 
 
**Mordred:**
I pulled a stunt here to hammer into her what her role was. She'll be a bit more decent from now on. 
 
**Mash:**
Mordred...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 You look after others well. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Even so, a bit too rough...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Shut up. You guys drop your guard way too much and it was pissing me off, that's all. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's not like me to teach swordsmanship to others. In fact, this was my first time. Damn you! 
 
**Mordred:**
Listen. Not a word of this to Jekyll. He'll interrogate me again. 
 
**Mordred:**
And sorry, Fujimaru. I apologize for disrespecting you. You are indeed weak, but it's a practical kind of weak. 
 
**Mordred:**
You're no coward nor scoundrel. You're an idiot worth carrying, in your own way. Right, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, definitely! After all, Senpai is the best Master in Chaldea! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Mash. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Best in Chaldea is saying too much...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Okay, okay, enough already. This is so sweet I'm getting indigestion. 
 
**Mordred:**
All right, time to hurry onward, Fujimaru,Mash. Keep that shield at the ready and follow me. 
 
**Mash:**
Okay! Thank you very much, kind Sir Mordred! 
 
**Mordred:**
D-Don't suddenly start calling me "Sir Mordred," dummy! You're gonna make me trip! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
All hostile units eliminated...Complete silence confirmed. Good work, Senpai. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good work. I received a transmission from Jekyll, so I'll connect you. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Can you hear me? I have supplemental information to pass on. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh&mdash;I see. They took the radio transmission from Jekyll and patched it through via Dr. Roman's channel. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Right. Chaldea's technology is marvelous. But let me cut to the chase. It's about the Magical Tome running amok in Soho. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Unlike killer homunculi or automatas, the Magical Tome can get past closed doors and into buildings. That we know. 
 
**Jekyll:**
We have specifics on the damage now. They say it puts people into an unending slumber. 
 
**Mordred:**
Through magecraft? Or a drug? 
 
**Jekyll:**
We don't know yet. If it's just a drug, it shouldn't pose any issue for you...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I don't think that would affect us. Senpai has Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary), too. 
 
**Mordred:**
I see, that's good. But well, nothing beats good, old-fashioned vigilance. 
 
**Mordred:**
If it is magecraft, in my case, my Magic Resistance Skill nullifies most effects on me&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
But I can't block a direct hit of, say, a drug made by a Servant's skill or Noble Phantasm at high magecraft levels. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's be really careful. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's okay if it doesn't hit us. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Well, yeah. Just act carefully. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Once you've arrived in the Soho area,stop by the antique bookshop I specified first. 
 
**Jekyll:**
There should be an informant there. That is,if they haven't been attacked by Magical Tomes yet. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. 
 
**Mordred:**
Then let's get going. Soho's not far off now. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Boy:**
...So you've finally come. I was getting pretty sick of waiting, you idiots. 
 
**Boy:**
Thanks to you, I've ended up reading an entire novel series, roughly 20 volumes, that I didn't even want to read. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who's this? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A child? 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Boy:**
You're the rescue team Mr. Henry Jekyll said was coming? Then, let me quickly fill you in on the situation here. 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? Wait, so the informant he mentioned is this brat? 
 
**Mash:**
This boy, as it were. He must have some relation to this antique bookshop. 
 
**Mash:**
Maybe he's the shopkeeper's son or relative...or grandson. Is that correct? 
 
**Mash:**
You're the one who contacted Mr. Jekyll,and are seeking help from us, right? 
 
**Boy:**
Yes, that's right. The situation being what it is,a rough understanding is fine for now. 
 
**Mordred:**
You kind of...have a really nice voice. Is your voice changing right now? 
 
**Boy:**
Yeah, I've always wanted to be in theaters. 
 
**Boy:**
So embarrassing. Nothing more embarrassing than a life where you couldn't achieve what you want! 
 
**Boy:**
Well, we'll put talk of my beautiful voice aside. I'll be talking your ears off from here, anyway. 
 
**Boy:**
For now, let's talk about "this place. " The Magical Tome already assaulted the elderly shopkeeper here. 
 
**Boy:**
Nearly half of Soho's people met the same fate. They've fallen into unending slumber, and now dream merrily together. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Do you know where the Magical Tome is now? Also, how did you manage to escape its attack? 
 
**Boy:**
Huh? Are you stupid? Is your brain, not just your voice,in la-la land? Obviously, I ran away from it! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? ...Oh! Um, s-sorry...Of course...That makes perfect sense...Ha, ha, sorry...I apologize...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ha, ha...Ha, ha, ha...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, please don't get hurt by a child's words. Kids that age tend to speak very bluntly. 
 
**Boy:**
So, you asked where the Magical Tome is. Right here. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Boy:**
It's on the 2nd floor residence of the bookshop...In other words, still on this floor, in the study next door. 
 
**Mordred:**
Haha! Well, well! So it's right there? 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, indoor combat is dangerous. We should avoid combat in narrow, enclosed spaces if we can. 
 
**Mash:**
There is a chance that you and the boy would get caught up in the fight. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then let's fight in an open space. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Lure it outside! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...All right. Mordred, if you will. 
 
**Mordred:**
Okay, let's get this over with! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fou:**
Foou!? 
 
**Mordred:**
Dammit, I know the attacks are hitting, but they're not getting through! What's with this book? 
 
**Mash:**
I don't get it either. Our attacks are landing, but it's not going down! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm are you sure it's not an illusion? And are you sure your attacks are hitting? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Doctor. We have no status anomalies. 
 
**Magical Tome:**
......
 
**Mordred:**
Tch, floating around like that! So cheeky for a book, are you missing pages or something!? 
 
**Boy:**
More like a banned book. If the contents are true, then even as a book it can kill people...Or so the story goes. 
 
**Mash:**
The boy from earlier...You shouldn't come out! It's dangerous! Go back! 
 
**Boy:**
Keep watching the Magical Tome, miss. Don't worry about me, I'll take off as soon as I say what needs to be said. 
 
**Mordred:**
You...I thought you had a good voice, but I never thought. 
 
**Mordred:**
Are you by chance a Servant? Damn, this fog is clouding my intuition! 
 
**Boy:**
You finally noticed. Yes, I'm a Heroic Spirit like you. Or rather&mdash;
 
**Boy:**
Did you think a kid reading rare books so calmly in a time like this is normal? 
 
**Boy:**
The ability to detect magical energy aside, your intuition as a reader is abysmal, Saber. You should read more. 
 
**Boy:**
I recommend the series in shelf E on the 1st floor. They're full of dreams, adventures, and bad endings you might like. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hey&mdash;who the hell are you! You sure know how to jok&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
Andersen. Hans Christian Andersen. 
 
**Andersen:**
My class is Caster. If you want to know the details, read one of my books. 
 
**Mash:**
What? What? &mdash;Whaaat!? 
 
**Mash:**
Hans Christian Andersen, the author&ndash; Amazing...He's one of the top three fairy tale authors in the world, Senpai! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calm down. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you like fairy tales? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Oh, no...Well...I wouldn't say I love them,but I have read quite a few of them. 
 
**Andersen:**
Oh. You don't have to hide it, it's obvious! You're an avid reader! I have an avid reader among Servants! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
First characters from fictional novels,now an actual author! And, our enemy is a book! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, it's turning into another confusing situation, Fujimaru! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So how's Mr. Andersen? Is he amazing as a Servant!? 
 
**Andersen:**
Huh? What does that bonehead expect? I'm an author. Of course I'm absolutely powerless. 
 
**Andersen:**
It's neat to encounter a Magical Tome that attacks people, but it's literally impossible for me to defeat it alone. 
 
**Andersen:**
So, here I am, waiting for Servants fit for physical labor to show up! 
 
**Andersen:**
Now go fight, Saber and Ms. Avid Reader! I'll keep detailed notes of the entire affair! 
 
**Fou:**
Mmm, kyuu! Kyaau! 
 
**Mordred:**
Shut up, please shut up! I feel like killing you before the Magical Tome! 
 
**Andersen:**
What? Not only do you lack intelligence to study the Magical Tome, you can't make distinctions between friend and foe? 
 
**Andersen:**
Amazing. An extreme barbarian! You know,your head must be filled with mashed potatoes! 
 
**Mordred:**
Move aside, Shieldy! I'm going to beat the crap out of that punk first! 
 
**Mash:**
I know how you feel but calm down! Mr. Andersen, please say something to her, too! 
 
**Andersen:**
Say something? Oh, something beneficial. Hmm. Well then, here's a lecture. 
 
**Andersen:**
You have experienced the nature of the Magical Tome,yes? Attacks are ineffective. Of course they are. 
 
**Andersen:**
It's because you think it's a book. It's not. It's a type of Reality Marble. 
 
**Mash:**
Reality Marble!? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Reality Marble? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
As I recall, that's...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. It's a type of powerful magecraft that rewrites how the world exists. They say it's almost equivalent to True Magic. 
 
**Mash:**
Rarely, there are cases when a Servant materialized uses it as their Noble Phantasm&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
Right, maybe a Reality Marble affects the space it's in. But that's different. Its existence itself is a Reality Marble. 
 
**Andersen:**
That's why it has endurance near invincibility. It effectively utilizes the fact it is a Reality Marble. 
 
**Andersen:**
Then, why is that possible? Good. That's a natural question. 
 
**Andersen:**
But figure out that much on your own! There's plenty of food for thought, anyone can make sense of it in minutes! 
 
**Mordred:**
But we don't have those few minutes! State the conclusion! The conclusion! 
 
**Mordred:**
It's floating right now,but we don't know when it will attack again! 
 
**Andersen:**
How hasty...Do you start books at the ending? Oh, fine. Out of respect for the avid reader, I'll tell you. 
 
**Andersen:**
My reason by analogy is that it originally was a Servant that projects the psyche of its Master. 
 
**Andersen:**
It's easy if you elicit from dramaturgy. Though, I needed to ponder for about an hour. 
 
**Mordred:**
You took your sweet time! Enough! State the conclusion! The conclusion! 
 
**Andersen:**
The conclusion, or rather, the problem is before you. This is a "stray. " There is no Master. 
 
**Andersen:**
That's why it attacked the people in Soho. It put them to sleep and made them dream. 
 
**Andersen:**
In short, it's searching for a Master. To manifest the dream, it's "trying to materialize" as a Pseudo-Servant. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see! So the guise of this Magical Tome has no substance! 
 
**Andersen:**
Good answer! It's not even a Servant. It's a clump of magical energy that wants to be a Servant. 
 
**Andersen:**
It will materialize eventually if left alone. In return, every citizen of Soho will fall asleep. 
 
**Andersen:**
Compared to the fog of magical energy drifting outside,the damage may not be as vicious. 
 
**Andersen:**
However. 
 
**Andersen:**
Some may become emaciated and die while asleep,but perhaps nobody will die. 
 
**Andersen:**
To begin with, if sleep takes so much of one's time,we writers would go out of business! 
 
**Andersen:**
So, it will be defeated. Soho has many bookstores, both new and used. 
 
**Mash:**
You contradict yourself, Mr. Andersen! You just said it has no substance so we can't defeat&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
I mean, you can't look for a book without a title. It's easy to give substance to a story. 
 
**Andersen:**
Can you hear me? I'll give you a name, Magical Tome, no&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
&mdash;A Tale for Someone, Nursery Rhyme! 
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
!!! 
 
**Mordred:**
You can do things when you actually try, punk! But why didn't you do anything until now!? 
 
**Andersen:**
Idiot, if I gave it substance, it would attack me, too. Just saying, I'm very weak in fistfights. 
 
**Andersen:**
I told you I had no choice but to hold my breath and read books until you guys, the physical labor, showed up. 
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...Nursery...Rhyme...
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
No, it's not. That's not "my" name, "my" name is Alice. 
 
**Andersen:**
Mmm? Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Something...is a bit off from Mr. Andersen's predictions...But, Senpai, this is...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's materializing! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All's well that ends well! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, the enemy is materializing! Now I can clearly discern its form! 
 
**Mordred:**
All right. Let's do it! Afterwards, I'm gonna choke that punk! 
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Alice, where are you? Alice isn't...here...
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Hey, big sisters. Where is the lonely "me? "
 
**Andersen:**
...You don't have a Master. No, to be exact, she probably is not in this era. 
 
**Andersen:**
...I can't believe there was a Master who loved a book without a title this much. 
 
**Andersen:**
This is what you call painful to watch. I'm sorry, but please defeat it quickly. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Andersen:**
...All bark and no bite. I was expecting at least a reproduction of Wonderland. 
 
**Andersen:**
I guess that was expecting too much. It didn't help that we were too powerful. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Hey. What was that about us being too powerful, punk? 
 
**Mordred:**
Not only did you stand there like a damn statue,I think all you ever did was run your mouth and insult us! 
 
**Mash:**
P-Please, let's stop it, Mordred. 
 
**Mash:**
He has a sharp tongue for sure, but we were able to defeat the Magical Tome&mdash;Nursery Rhyme thanks to him! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Foou! 
 
**Mordred:**
Tch...You're right. I know. It's my loss if I meddle with people of this sort. 
 
**Andersen:**
What, contrary to your looks...Wait, maybe you do have that look...Wait, maybe not after all. Your soul is like a Morning Star! 
 
**Mordred:**
Morning Star, like a flail? So I'm thorny, huh? Dammit! I hate to admit it but you make a good point! 
 
**Andersen:**
...Good reaction...With training, you might be easy prey...Excuse me, a good reader. What a waste. 
 
**Andersen:**
But to think I'd be defended from a hater by an avid reader. Humans never change regardless of era. 
 
**Mordred:**
Both Mash and I are Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. But I was originally a human...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
More like,most Servants were originally humans. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Tch. Oh well. That thing didn't seem like it used to be human, though. 
 
**Fou:**
...Fou...
 
**Andersen:**
Right, most of Heroic Spirits were humans,but sometimes there are cases like Nursery Rhyme. 
 
**Andersen:**
Cases where a human creation gains its own will, or gathers visions from people to become a "Conceptual Heroic Spirit. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Those are rare, though. Someday, there might even be Heroic Spirits of machines as well as books. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, thank you for all your work. Go back to Jekyll's apartment for now. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Andersen, can you come, too? It's most reassuring to have more Servants as allies. 
 
**Mordred:**
What?! We're taking this punk with us? 
 
**Mordred:**
He's super weak. I'm sure he'll be useless! He's so boring, too! I'm sure he won't write any decent books! 
 
**Andersen:**
&mdash;I see. Okay, I'm happy to go with you. 
 
**Andersen:**
I had no intention of helping you,but that last statement changed my mind. 
 
**Andersen:**
My pleasure, Saber. No, Sir Mordred. By the way, if you are to be a protagonist, what's your favorite genre? 
 
**Andersen:**
A tragedy? A farce? Or a comedy? Splendid. I'll polish it into the best trashy tale ever. 
 
**Mordred:**
I see. Why don't you go write some unpopular books and cry in a corner, fairy tale author. 
 
**Mash:**
(Um, excuse me, that's rude, he can hear that)
 
**Mordred:**
I wanted him to hear it. Only a coward talks behind one's back. 
 
**Mash:**
......
 
**Andersen:**
Well, let's move. Let's leave before the antique bookshop's owner wakes up. 
 
**Andersen:**
Because I'm also a thief. Actually, I snuck in from the back door. 
 
**Andersen:**
It'd be awkward if he woke up and called the cops. Getting arrested despite helping is going too far for a trashy book! 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh!? 
 
**Mordred:**
You entered without permission,and still acted that confidently!? 
 
## Section 5: Helter Skelter 
 
**Andersen:**
My, what a lovely little hideout. I like it. I'll take the study next door. 
 
**Andersen:**
I'll be unpacking, so call me if you need me. Oh, and don't forget to knock. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Wow, I'm so tired. That baggage made me double tired. No, triple tired! 
 
**Jekyll:**
She's wrecking my personal sofa again...I'd prefer you use the one for guests...Oh, never mind. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Just stay there and listen. Mash, you and Fujimaru too. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Jack the Ripper is back. And this time they're not murdering women in the fog. 
 
**Jekyll:**
They're currently putting Scotland Yard under siege. I'm picking up calls for help from stations all over London. 
 
**Mordred:**
That guy! That bastard finally came out! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds like a grudge. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
An acquaintance? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. A Servant of Assassin class. We fought a few times in the fog...
 
**Mordred:**
Escapes every time. I can't quite finish 'em off. They escape into the fog! 
 
**Mordred:**
On top of that, I can't remember a face, figure, or specific abilities! It pisses me off! 
 
**Mordred:**
Every time I hear "Jack the Ripper,"all I can do is think, "Oh yeah, that Assassin! "
 
**Mordred:**
Dammit! It's so frustrating! That stupid little&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
You may have had an encounter as well. How about it? Do you remember fighting "an Assassin? "
 
**Mash:**
Oh...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I think I do...I think it was an Assassin. We...were ambushed...
 
**Mash:**
That's right...We were ambushed. My memories suddenly came back to me. 
 
**Mash:**
I couldn't remember most of the details until now. But, if it's a Servant, we can guess why&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A skill? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A Noble Phantasm? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. That's right. It's due to either a skill or a Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mordred:**
They're fast. We should hurry before they get away. Let's go! 
 
**Andersen:**
What, stepping out? Then say so. Bring me back...I know! Some scones would be great. 
 
**Mordred:**
You're not coming!? No, you wouldn't be useful if you did...
 
**Mordred:**
...Wait. Can you make them easier to beat, like that last one? 
 
**Andersen:**
The last one was an extreme exception. Don't count on it. What do you expect an author to do to begin with? 
 
**Andersen:**
Do you think authors are all-powerful, omniscient gods? Then you need to learn better. 
 
**Andersen:**
Listen to me. Authors are just fools who fled to the pen when reality wouldn't go their way. 
 
**Andersen:**
Do you really think I can help you with anything? 
 
**Mordred:**
...I was stupid for asking. Let's go, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mordred:**
We'll go as fast as we can. Mash, carry Fujimaru. It's a race against time. 
 
**Mordred:**
We can't slow down for a human. We'll head to the Yard at Servants' full speed. 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right.... Senpai, excuse me for a bit. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't drop me. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pleasure's mine. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
R-Right. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'll do everything I can not to drop you. Don't let go of my hand. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hey, hurry up&mdash;Tch. There's the enemy already! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Multiple enemy responses, coming from all directions. Break through before they surround us! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
That's most of them! Forget the rest and just run, Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He fights pretty fiercely. I guess he really is the Treacherous Knight of legend. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, you're right. His combat powers match what's in the legend. 
 
**Mash:**
He's swift and accurate, like a bolt of lighting flashing through the sky. You won't sense a shred of doubt in his blade. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Treacherous Knight? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean Mordred? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, come to think&mdash; I never gave Fujimaru a proper explanation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mordred the Treacherous Knight has manifested here as a Saber class. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course, he's not from this era. He's from the Arthurian legends of the 5th and 6th century. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The one who brought upon its end. He literally betrayed King Arthur. 
 
**Mash:**
It was no ordinary betrayal, either. He brought together all of Arthur's enemies, both domestic and foreign...
 
**Mash:**
...and became what we call the Treacherous King. In peaceful times, he could've been king himself. 
 
**Mash:**
There are many stories of his own glory. He was originally a Knight of the Round Table&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And is said to be King Arthur's "son. "But there's also stories that the King didn't admit such. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Some say that's the reason for his betrayal. At the end, why did Mordred betray King Arthur? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Only he&mdash;no, she herself knows. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did the rebellion succeed? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did the rebellion fail? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Mordred died during the battle on the Hill of Camlann. 
 
**Mash:**
They killed each other. She fought King Arthur with the sword Clarent...
 
**Mash:**
...and King Arthur fought with a holy spear and pierced her through. 
 
**Mash:**
King Arthur was fatally wounded as well and&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
What are you guys babbling about? Hurry up and let's go! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, r-right! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's hurry! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Roger, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
They're attacking us while we run! They just keep coming! 
 
**Mordred:**
Don't stop, Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Right...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry to interrupt while you're moving. I've got news from Da Vinci. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll give you her analysis on Helter Skelter,that huge armored robot. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's still not finished,but according to what she's found so far...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
First, it's not a Golem. The video showed no traces of magecraft. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if it's a pure machine...there's still many unknowns,except that it seems to be steam-operated. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It looks like technology that doesn't exist in our year of 2017. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It was made via some technology that was hidden, or perhaps lost&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's as if it's a product of some super-technology from a world that took a "different path" than our own. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Yeah. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...So, I guess you're running right now. It would make sense that you wouldn't answer. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's all I've got. Good luck, guys! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Jack the Ripper:**
...Oh? 
 
**Jack the Ripper:**
You came out here. All right. Hehe...what should we do? 
 
**Jack the Ripper:**
Should we kill you? One, two, three, lots. Lots. 
 
**Jack the Ripper:**
Hehe. We killed lots and lots,but we're still hungry. We're starving. 
 
**Jack the Ripper:**
The police officers don't have much magical energy, you know. 
 
**Jack the Ripper:**
So thanks for coming. We'll be full after we eat your magical energy. 
 
**Mordred:**
We made it&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
No, I don't think we did. This smells of blood...the Yard's been wiped out, huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are two moving responses there besides you. Jack the Ripper, and one more. 
 
**Mash:**
We can assume it's an unknown Servant. You there&mdash;
 
**H：???:**
Yes. I'm a Caster Servant. I'm one of the leaders of the "Project" you know of. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Project Demonic Fog? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why are you doing this? 
 

---

 
**H：???:**
It's a complex set of circumstances, you see. Oh, please call me "P. "
 
**"P":**
Unfortunately, you're too late. Scotland Yard has been slaughtered to the last man. 
 
**"P":**
They all died horribly. That girl has no compassion within her at all. 
 
**"P":**
But it was necessary. A necessary sacrifice. That's all I can say. 
 
**"P":**
Man is to be loved. Love and emotions are both noble, brilliant things. 
 
**"P":**
But&mdash; How sad. Sometimes they pale in comparison to the greater good. 
 
**"P":**
Something we need was kept inside Scotland Yard. 
 
**"P":**
Figures the British Empire, home of the Mage's Association and the Clock Tower, would put a heavy magical seal on. 
 
**"P":**
And so, sadly,they were in the way of our greater good. 
 
**Mordred:**
Why do you mouth off like you actually know stuff? I could care less about love and emotions! 
 
**Mordred:**
Yet again, you guys laid your hands on what's mine. You're no king. How dare you touch what belongs to a king! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A Heroic Spirit, killing innocent people? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Have you no pride as a hero? 
 

---

 
**"P":**
Yes, and so you see. I am so filled with sorrow I cannot control myself. 
 
**"P":**
Humans, possessing emotion, should be sacred. Humans, filled with love, should be dazzling. 
 
**"P":**
My power cannot save them. No, looking at the results, it could never save them. 
 
**"P":**
Time is being incinerated. Humanity is being incinerated. 
 
**"P":**
The march of civilization, emotions, love, are all disappearing. Only four more singularities remain in the world. 
 
**"P":**
How sad. But neither you nor I can stop it. 
 
**"P":**
No, if we could not stop it&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...I feel a contradiction. 
 
**Mash:**
A contradiction in your words when you speak of emotion. Caster, no, "P," who are you? 
 
**Mash:**
You used Jack to take human lives. You're surely the one without compassion. 
 
**"P":**
Yes, perhaps I am,beautiful young girl. 
 
**"P":**
I am a mage, and a wicked and cruel one at that. Even now, I tell an innocent girl as follows: 
 
**"P":**
Jack. You handle them. 
 
**"P":**
Do what you like. They might be "your mother. "
 
**Jack:**
Huh? They...might? 
 
**Jack:**
Oh, We see. Hmmm. Then we'll do to you what we do to Mommy, okay? 
 
**Jack:**
Will you let us "go back? "Will you let us go inside you...inside Mommy...
 
**Mordred:**
No. You're going straight back to the Throne. I'll kill you here. 
 
**Mash:**
I think we should stop Assassin here.... Senpai...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's stop her. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Prepare for combat. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Right, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jack:**
Mo-mmy...No...No, no, noo...It hurts...
 
**Jack:**
Why...Why? 
 
**Jack:**
...Why? Tell me...Please...Please? 
 
**"P":**
Farewell, child who knows not love. I pray that someday you find the love you seek. 
 
**"P":**
&mdash;Now then. I suppose I should die by your hands here as well. 
 
**"P":**
The wicked mage is defeated by the heroes. That is one of the endings I seek. 
 
**"P":**
But,I will first fulfill my duty. 
 
**"P":**
Farewell, you heroes who would walk the bright path. You too, Knight of the Round Table&mdash;
 
**"P":**
I pray that you forever remain the "heroes" who defeat evil. 
 
**Mordred:**
Wait! Aah, damn it! He disappeared! That's why I hate mages! 
 
**Mash:**
Teleportation&mdash;If it wasn't caused by the use of a Command Spell, it's...
 
**Mash:**
It's a skill closer to True Magic. With the way he did it...A possibility is the Holy Grail...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's possible. He did say that he was one of the people behind Project Demonic Fog trying to destroy this era. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's also possible that the owner of the Holy Grail teleported him away as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What are they...What are they trying to do here in London? 
 
**Mordred:**
Who cares? We'll find them and crush them. 
 
**"P":**
...I have returned. 
 
**"B":**
Sshhuu...Kkoohh...
 
**"M":**
Excellent work.... So that girl was defeated? 
 
**"P":**
Unfortunately, she's dead. A second loss, after Mephistopheles. 
 
**"M":**
The grand scheme remains unaffected. We need simply advance our "project. "
 
**"P":**
Yes, that's right. We are Servants. We obey our Master's words. 
 
**"P":**
There is no need for regret. You just need to move ahead with your "project. "
 
**"M":**
...I know. 
 
**"B":**
To pave the path for the world and civilization&mdash;That is our destiny as scholars. 
 
**"B":**
But the world has been incinerated...Humanity and civilization are on the path to an unchangeable end. 
 
**"B":**
We no longer&mdash;
 
## Section 6: London Night 
 
**Andersen:**
I'm glad to see you back. A shame about the officers at the Yard. 
 
**Andersen:**
Rest for a little. I heard you haven't rested at all since your arrival, right? 
 
**Andersen:**
Pushing yourself doesn't equate to good work. Be it writing or hunting for the Holy Grail, occasional breaks are needed. 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you. But...there's no time. 
 
**Andersen:**
Fool. Are you a workaholic, too? Can you not forget the weight of what you carry? 
 
**Andersen:**
Then let me tell you a story to pass the time. A story of how Nursery Rhyme and I materialized. 
 
**Mash:**
Um...you mean Alice, right? That's what she called herself...
 
**Andersen:**
No, Nursery Rhyme. You left for the Yard before I could tell you. 
 
**Andersen:**
I didn't get to say this, but both Nursery Rhyme and I appeared "from the demonic fog. "
 
**Andersen:**
With no Master,and no summoning ritual, either. 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, so was I, come to think of it. Jekyll's no Master, and there was no summoning ritual. 
 
**Mordred:**
I just woke up one moment in the fog. Huh, do Servants just naturally appear like that? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe they do. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, no, no! That's impossible! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you can just appear...No, be summoned on your own,you're something way more powerful than a Servant! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know about that...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, it's normally impossible. 
 
**Mash:**
If you mean&mdash;naturally appearing Heroic Spirits,there aren't many, but there are a few such records. 
 
**Mash:**
But when that happens,they don't have a personality of their own. 
 
**Mash:**
When a Heroic Spirit appears as a Servant,they're always summoned from the Throne by a ritual. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Listen, in the other three eras we went to, the Servants were always summoned under the Grail's influence. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's absolutely impossible for a Servant to just appear on its own! 
 
**Andersen:**
So the Servants aren't appearing from the fog, then? That leaves one possibility. 
 
**Andersen:**
The fog was "created by the Holy Grail. "Or, what creates the fog is influenced by the Holy Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
That's...what it would mean. That's the logical conclusion. No contradictions. 
 
**Andersen:**
Logic applies to most things in the real world. About the only thing it doesn't apply to is love. 
 
**Andersen:**
Use your imagination. Then, you'll anticipate most things, and sometimes even predict them. 
 
**Mordred:**
Haha. Love? Like you'd know, you punk. 
 
**Andersen:**
I don't want to hear that from a kid who doesn't even know love. I'm a virgin. I know all about love and romance. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Huh? Hmm. Huh? That doesn't make sense, does it? Hmm? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know, but those are amazing words. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hmm? It's true, it doesn't...
 

---

 
**Andersen:**
Have you forgotten? I am Andersen. My storytelling makes me a Caster Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Andersen:**
If a swordsman's skills lie in battle, an author's skills lie in letters, words, indolence, pain, and love. 
 
**Andersen:**
Be it improv poetry or a crazy deadline,a true author is capable of anything when serious. 
 
**Andersen:**
I am a creative author. Not many can match me for imagination. 
 
**Andersen:**
I won't lose a debate to an amateur. If you're not going to rest, go for a late-night patrol. 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. You're right! If we can nab that "P"and make him talk, we can end this. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'm going for a patrol then. I'll take a walk to the edge of the city area. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, Senpai...Mordred is about to leave. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's follow. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's better to act than do nothing. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Jekyll:**
You're good at manipulating people, huh? But thanks, they were under a lot of strain. 
 
**Andersen:**
It's nothing compared to writing a moving story. 
 
**Andersen:**
I just had to "motivate" them.... But I don't understand. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Hmm? 
 
**Andersen:**
What I showed them may be an illusion. A wisp within a match light. Logical or not, it's no different from a fantasy. 
 
**Jekyll:**
You just used your imagination, right? So&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
Don't be stupid. That was just a "play" on words. 
 
**Mordred:**
...It feels strange to do a patrol with a bunch of people. 
 
**Mordred:**
I always did it on my own. Well, this makes it easier,so I don't mind...Oh, there's some already. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I just can't match Mordred for speed. I see them too. Enemy responses! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
There were quite a few. Whew. 
 
**Mash:**
You must be tired. Do you need to rest? 
 
**Mordred:**
No, there were just so many of them. It would be different if there had been a Helter Skelter. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's quite strong. It's probably the only enemy I've enjoyed fighting during this materialization. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash and Fujimaru have only encountered it once. It was a tough opponent. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe there aren't that many of them? Come to think,you covered a lot of ground but haven't seen any. 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah...Come to think, I've never seen big groups of them. 
 
**Mordred:**
If possible, I'd like to go up against a tough enemy. I hope we'll see one tonight. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now that you've said it, we will. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're jinxing us. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, you think so? 
 
**Mash:**
Why don't we go on a bit further? There is still some distance to the City's edge. 
 
**Mash:**
Um, well, I'm confirming map information...It's not like I'm particularly familiar with London. 
 
**Mordred:**
Well, if something turns up, we'll deal with it then. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...Hmph, more gutless enemies. 
 
**Mash:**
All enemies destroyed. No, I don't think they were as easy to defeat as you say...
 
**Mordred:**
If the fog makes Servants appear,I want it to toss out a strong one. 
 
**Mordred:**
Oh...But you know. What if what comes out isn't necessarily an enemy? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right. In fact, you've been helping us. Same goes for Andersen. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, Nursery Rhyme and Jack were enemies. Both were likely Servants that materialized from the Demonic Fog, too. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'd like to occasionally see an enemy that faces me head-on, instead of all these guys that attack from behind. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Indeed. 
 
**Mordred:**
Right? You're quite a perceptive Master. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sneak attacks are good too. 
 
**Mordred:**
...You really think so? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, let's continue patrolling. It's only a little bit further to the edge of the City. 
 
**Mordred:**
Come at me! Strong enemies! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Shakespeare:**
Well then&mdash;who is it that doth summon me!? I, Caster Shakespeare, travelled with great haste to the city of fog. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Or so I wish to say to you. But it seems that I was not summoned to participate in a Holy Grail War this time. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
This is quite vexing indeed. O God! Where dost lie the grand story that I am destined to behold? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
No reply. Silence. God hast forsaken me. Where art the tale making blood boil, flesh dance, heart shiver, and soul shake! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Then, I can only utter these words. Oh, "Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind! "
 
**Mordred:**
...This is a blank. Next. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah, what have we here? How curious our paths should finally cross within this unfathomable fog! 
 
**Mash:**
Do you know him? This, uh...Caster Shakespeare guy? 
 
**Mordred:**
Never heard of him. He's a blank. 
 
**Mordred:**
But we just confirmed our theory. Right now, this guy materialized from the Demonic Fog. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
It is a tragedy that my Master does not exist. But, I was able to meet you. Surely this too is destiny. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I shall weave a tale of your exploits. I pray that your tale shall live up to your reputation. 
 
**Mordred:**
Ugh...
 
**Mordred:**
This guy&mdash;doesn't look like an enemy. It's kind of odd if you think about it. 
 
**Mordred:**
What's the difference between him and the likes of Jack or that clown? Jack aside, everyone moved on their own will. 
 
**Mordred:**
Also&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Never mind. Wait. What, did this night patrol hit the jackpot? 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Mordred:**
He's here. The one we've been waiting for. Hey you! You got some nerve for someone who fled! 
 
**"P":**
...Looks like I am late. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's "P! "
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just when did he...
 

---

 
**"P":**
How unfortunate. It seems you have already procured the Servant that newly materialized. 
 
**"P":**
He appears to be a Caster. If only we had procured him, he would have made a fine ally. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hah hah. I get it. It's really quite simple when you reveal the trick. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Now I understand as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So, you procure and round up Servants materializing from the Demonic Fog, and make them your allies. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. Logically it's simple. But, easier said than done. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unless you have the Holy Grail, it's impossible to make Heroic Spirits move according to your will. 
 
**"P":**
&mdash;Correct. I confess as much. It is as you say. 
 
**"P":**
We continue to wait in London for those who are indispensable to us to manifest themselves. 
 
**"P":**
So, we procure Heroic Spirits materializing from the fog one by one, and "adjust" them so they work on expanding the fog. 
 
**"P":**
It is truly regrettable indeed that we were not able to procure all of you. 
 
**"P":**
We surely would have been fine friends. All of us. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I doubt it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're kidding me. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Senpai. I feel exactly the same as you do. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hah! Seriously. You'll have to allow me to pass on that! 
 
**Mordred:**
You won't get away this time! Mage, name yourself before I cut you down! 
 
**"P":**
&mdash;As you wish. There is no catalyst to transport at this time. I shall procure you here myself. 
 
**"P":**
I am Paracelsus von Hohenheim. I manipulate the Four Great Elementals, and I seek the True Ether. 
 
**Paracelsus:**
Of course...I possess a different objective at the moment. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, prepare for a battle between Servants! Your orders&mdash;! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Paracelsus:**
...A most natural result. 
 
**Paracelsus:**
This is precisely what I'd expect from a sword-wielding hero. Naturally, evildoers must fall. 
 
**Paracelsus:**
Overcoming all the world's evils. Resisting all this world's greed. 
 
**Paracelsus:**
And you who will carve out the future of this world. May the path before you...
 
**Paracelsus:**
...be somehow illuminated...By true...light...
 
**Mash:**
...I have confirmed termination of the enemy Servant. Victory is ours, Senpai. 
 
**Mordred:**
Damn. The idiot disappeared without a trace. He was a nauseating mage from beginning to end. 
 
**Mordred:**
"Carve out the future? " Give me a break. As if I'm the type to do that. Ugh. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. "
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? What was that? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
It's nothing but a few fanciful phrases crossing my mind. It is quite a fine spectacle that you have shown me today. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I was only able to behold the mage in a short role,but he provided a truly satisfying final act. 
 
**Mordred:**
...What an idiot. You're just being delusional. 
 
## Section 7: One More Mystery 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai&mdash;Are you okay? You seem a little pale. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sleepy. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's so early in the morning. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...I suppose so. But early-morning patrols are necessary. 
 
**Mash:**
Mordred's actions are not mistaken. What happened last night may very well happen again. 
 
**Mash:**
However, it's not ideal...If you are starting to feel excessive fatigue...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry so much. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Okay. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's pretty inconvenient to be a Master. But I guess you live with it, as you're still human. 
 
**Mordred:**
All the enemies are pushovers anyway. I could handle them myself&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...Mechanical sounds detected. There's a big one approaching! 
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, speak of the devil. Hah, maybe I'll finally get to fight a Helter Skelter! 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, Master! Preparing for battle! Your orders, please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I've got bad news for you. Sorry, but listen up. Right around where you are...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, can you hear them now? Well, that's what I'm talking about. 
 
**Mordred:**
Great, bring it on! I'll crush as many as I need to! It's pretty great slashing my way through thick steel. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm really, really sorry Master! Entering consecutive battles! Your orders, please. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...You know, even I'm getting kind of tired. 
 
**Mordred:**
We should make our way back to Jekyll's apartment. I don't need sleep, but I want to recover my magical energy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahhh...Umm, this is kind of hard to say, but...
 
**Mordred:**
...I know, I know, so just shut up. I already sense them. There's quite a few. 
 
**Mash:**
...Mechanical sounds detected. Multiple large units! Predicting enemy count will further increase! 
 
**Mordred:**
I wish they would all just congregate in Hyde Park! Then, I'd turn them all to cinders with my Noble Phantasm! 
 
**Mash:**
Please restrain yourself. Massive firepower in the City area is dangerous! 
 
**Mordred:**
I'll be as careful as I can when I use it! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is getting more and more fun! 
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
I guess the enemy's getting serious now that a leader's down! Bring it on&mdash;I'll fight to the finish! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jekyll:**
...I see. So that's what's been happening. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Anyway, good work. Glad you made it back. Now please get some rest. 
 
**Mordred:**
Ah...That's much better...Ahhh...
 
**Jekyll:**
Sitting on my favorite sofa again...Well...Okay fine. You did put in a lot of effort both last night and just now. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dead tired. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wiped out. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, don't overdo it. Please rest up. From now on, I'll watch over your vitals, too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? That's actually my job...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
B-But you're right. It's more pleasing to be looked after by someone close to you...
 
**Jekyll:**
Still, I see...I didn't think mass production of Helter Skelters was possible before, but now the situation is dire. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's likely due to us defeating the mage Paracelsus AKA"P," one of the three leaders of Project Demonic Fog. 
 
**Jekyll:**
The enemy recognized you as a threat, and built up their strength in order to obtain materialized Heroic Spirits. 
 
**Jekyll:**
We should think of it that way. But, I wonder what kind of Heroic Spirit they're seeking...
 
**Mordred:**
I don't know. It's your job to do the thinking. I'm...exhausted. 
 
**Mordred:**
...That's right. Speaking of thinking, there's a freeloader who's only good for thinking. Hell, we got two of 'em. 
 
**Mordred:**
What are they doing right now, Jekyll? They're in the study, right? 
 
**Andersen:**
You called? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Did you summon us? 
 
**Mordred:**
...Sigh. I'm totally going to regret this. I should've known better. It's like you guys opened the Ark or something. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Ark? Do you mean that "Ark? "Hahaha, you are harsh indeed! What an exaggeration! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I do call myself a jack-in-the-box that releases grand, flowery words when cracked open...
 
**Shakespeare:**
...but I am no match for that cache of calamities! Rather, such a box does not exist to begin with. 
 
**Andersen:**
Indeed, it doesn't exist. It can't exist. As you know, its intended use is an impossibility. 
 
**Andersen:**
Nothing spoils fun like anecdotes of opening a box ending the world. The message is, if you want to die, die alone. 
 
**Mash:**
...Um, Senpai. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Let's not talk about the Ark. 
 
**Mash:**
...I agree. Despite what they say, those two are obviously into it. 
 
**Mash:**
I think the best thing to do is keep quiet. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, the Ark does exist. I know for sure. 
 
**Andersen & Shakespeare:**
Seriously!? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Mm? Oh, I do apologize. Young Andersen incited me into raising my voice. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
But that aside, Fujimaru,I am verily interested in what you were just saying! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Where and when did you see that Ark!? And who in the world opened it and for what reason!? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Specifically, in what way did the ultimate bad ending overflowed with both sorrow and farce!? 
 
**Andersen:**
...Hmm. (←listening calmly)
 
**Andersen:**
...Hmm. (←silently beginning to prepare tea)
 
**Andersen:**
...Hmm. (←spreading jam on a scone)
 
**Mordred:**
...Fool. You aroused a cat's curiosity. I know not of this. 
 
**Mordred:**
Fujimaru, Mash. Go talk in the study until they're satisfied. 
 
**Mash:**
Bummer...
 
**Jekyll:**
Good luck. Maybe you can count that as part of resting up? 
 
**Mordred:**
Ha! Do you think you can take a nap in front a pond of geese? Look at Fujimaru's face. I've never seen anyone so dumbfounded. 
 

---

 
**Andersen:**
Oh, that's right. I forgot to tell you what it is that we're doing. 
 
**Andersen:**
That playwright is focused on getting these events down on paper, but not me. I want to do as little work as possible. 
 
**Andersen:**
But there is something on my mind. I heard from Fujimaru of the developments leading up to now...The seven Singularities. 
 
**Andersen:**
...More precisely, something about the magecraft ritual called the Holy Grail War bothers me...
 
**Andersen:**
...I don't have enough materials to make a judgment. To be honest, I'm almost at a stalemate. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Hmph. I see you can act like a Caster. Although you're still useless...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, excuse me. Can we get back on topic? A review of the current situation, and future plans? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Luckily, enemy's awareness is focusing on the Demonic Fog. If they want to wipe us out, they'd go around destroying buildings. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The fact that they haven't means the enemy is only aware of the streets that the Demonic Fog extends to. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure there's something there to take advantage of&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
...Is there? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I hope so. Hmm...Is there? I hope there is...It'd be nice...
 
**Mordred:**
This is a pain, do something. We can't spend as much time outside like we used to. 
 
**Mordred:**
Wandering around aimlessly just eats away at my magical energy with each battle. 
 
**Mordred:**
If we could at least disable the Helter Skelters,it wouldn't be that much of an effort, but...
 
**Jekyll:**
There's no way. This is a problem, as we might end up in a stalemate. 
 
**Fran:**
...Urhh......Uhh, urhh...
 
**Andersen:**
All right, then how about this? 
 
**Andersen:**
There is an outbreak of Helter Skelters, but how about gathering some data to support my theory? 
 
**Andersen:**
Run an errand for me, basically. You guys have stamina, so isn't this the perfect job? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Working outside among all those Helter Skelters is a tall order...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's try it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's cooperate with Andersen and Shakespeare. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. It won't make our current situation any better but&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
I don't think things will get any better if we just stay holed up in this apartment. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, if there is anything we can do,getting on it would be constructive. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Still, you want us to gather data,but where are we supposed to go? 
 
**Fou:**
Kyu, fouuu...
 
**Andersen:**
Oh, come on, this is London. Your destination is obvious. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Obvious? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, what is it? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Maybe the Mage's Association&mdash;AKA "Clock Tower? "
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does he mean the Mage's Association? 
 
**Andersen:**
Correct. Once man enters AD, mages centered around a giant academy&mdash;the Mage's Association, Clock Tower. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah! 
 
**Andersen:**
Right. A giant academy that is unlocking the secrets of the world exists here in London. Why would you not use it? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're right...B-But in the state London is in now, I wonder...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If the Mage's Association&mdash;Clock Tower still stands,I'd naturally assume Jekyll is in contact with them. 
 
**Mash:**
Good point. Jekyll hasn't spoken about the Clock Tower. 
 
**Jekyll:**
...That's because there was no need. 
 
**Mordred:**
The Mage's Association...That's like underground, from Regent Park all the way to Westminster, right? 
 
**Mordred:**
After materializing and meeting Jekyll,I went there to check it out immediately. 
 
**Mordred:**
The British Museum, was it? I went there because I heard that's where the entrance was. 
 
**Mordred:**
But the entrance was completely sealed off. It was a ruined pile of rubble. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Yeah. Strangely enough, "the building was demolished. "No part was left untouched. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Thinking back, perhaps the mastermind of "Project Demonic Fog" crushed all possibility of resistance. 
 
**Andersen:**
I don't mind if it got destroyed. So what if it's a pile of rubbles. 
 
**Andersen:**
Nothing could be better if the mages are alive, but that has nothing to do with my objective one way or another. 
 
**Andersen:**
What I need are records. Data. 
 
**Andersen:**
It's certain that the important archives are protected by considerably firm seals. Take me there. 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuuu...Fou...
 
**Shakespeare:**
Then I shall accompany you. The ruins of a mystic academy should serve as a font of inspiration! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It seems this is going to be a large group. But...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I suppose the more firepower the better, in case you encounter Helter Skelters. Yeah, that makes sense. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh......Urhh? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You should stay here, Fran. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's dangerous, so hold the fort, Fran. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I agree. Right now, London is especially dangerous. Please stay here, Fran. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, urrh...
 
**Andersen:**
Then let's be off. We'll visit that formerly flourishing mystic academy. 
 
**Andersen:**
Oh, and also Saber...Do make sure to protect us weak Casters. 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? Protect you? Say that to Shieldy over there. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, u-um&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
All right, I'm going, too! Let's go! 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Wha...
 
## Section 8: The Death of the Mage's Association 
 
**Mordred:**
...You know. You said "a large group,"but we can't count you in during combat. 
 
**Jekyll:**
You're looking for the ruins of the Mage's Association,yes? Surely my intellectual curiosity as a scholar will be aroused. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Besides, I can be good when need to. You see, I also have an "ace up my sleeve. "
 
**Jekyll:**
And I have faith that you'll all protect me. I'm counting on you, Saber. 
 
**Mordred:**
Tch. As I said, I'm not protecting anyone. But do as you like. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right then. We really should get moving. The British Museum means we're heading to the Regent Park area. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's some distance from here. You'd best prepare yourselves for a succession of battles. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mmm? Come to think of it&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Didn't the Mage's Association exist as several college towns in the London suburbs and stuff? 
 
**Jekyll:**
That's that. This is this. 
 
**Jekyll:**
The Mage's Association originated at their London HQ,and added facilities centuries later as they grew in scale. 
 
**Jekyll:**
That's why interspersed college towns center around London, as it's the heart of Mage's Association and Clock Tower. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Multiple cities built to surround London comprise the rest of the Association. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Doctor, have you never been to the Clock Tower before? 
 
**Andersen:**
Oh. I knew there was something unpolished about you. Are you a country bumpkin? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gulp. N-No, of course not. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's just that I haven't had much connection to London,I mean, being so far away...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
B-But I knew what was going on in London! Director Marie was sent from the Mage's Association, too! 
 
**Mordred:**
Enough chatter. We need to&mdash;Ah, as soon as I think it. Here we go. 
 
**Mash:**
Multiple machine sounds ahead. Senpai, I think the Helter Skelters are here! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They didn't waste any time. Fight your way through them and get to Regent Park on the double! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go right through them! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Shakespeare:**
The British Museum! A symbol of the British Empire! Or rather, what remains&mdash;
 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, what a sorrowful sight! This museum once held so many of humanity's greatest treasures! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I cannot help but sigh. This building once held human progress itself. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Can such a thing be allowed! Oh! 'Tis like the burning of the Library of Alexandria! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Truly, a shame&mdash;
 
**Shakespeare:**
However, however. This is the way of humanity as well. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Foolishness and grieving are human traits. "You, gods, will give us some faults to make us men. "
 
**Mordred:**
...It's no different than the last time I was here. Rubble. Ruin. Nothing else. 
 
**Mordred:**
Whoever destroyed this place must've had a personal grudge. There's no survivors. 
 
**Mash:**
So this is the British Museum...or what's left. I'd seen it, but just in image data...
 
**Mash:**
Nowhere else in London were buildings destroyed. Just here...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's sad. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't like destroyed buildings. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai...Yes...
 
**Andersen:**
All right, physical laborers. Oh, especially Saber and Mash Kyrielight. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? 
 
**Andersen:**
Start digging here. According to Jekyll,the Clock Tower spread underground as well. 
 
**Andersen:**
Despite the thorough wreckage, the ground is intact. That means what we're after is underground. 
 
**Andersen:**
But, unfortunately, the stairs are buried in rubble. So&mdash;You see? 
 
**Andersen:**
Time to show off the ridiculous strength of Servants! Now go smash stuff like a bulldozer! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
That's true! Sadly, I expend tremendous magical energy if I hold anything heavier than a pen! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Mordred:**
...
 
**Jekyll:**
I-I'll help. Yeah. I probably won't be of much use though. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yay! I'm faster this time! Magical energy responses near you! And lots of them! 
 
**Mordred:**
Hmm...It's true. There's something here. What is this? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You don't see anything, right? But it's there. And it's moving around. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not the Mystic Codes scattered in the rubble, either. Which means there's only one answer! 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's from below!? Saber, sorry, but get ready&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Don't treat me like you're my Master! I know! If they come out, we'll fight them! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, multiple incoming enemies! Magical energy signatures are growing&mdash;Assume they're attacking! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fight! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Master. Beginning combat! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I shall aid you as well. A shield maiden dancing amidst the rubble&mdash;truly stimulates the imagination! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Battle is over, Senpai. Good work. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't see Helter Skelters around,but we still ran into something troublesome...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Those were...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I remember that shape. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. The enemy has a striking resemblance to the magical tome we saw in Soho. 
 
**Mash:**
But this time our attacks worked...Without Andersen giving them a name. 
 
**Mash:**
Normal attacks alone were sufficient. They also didn't change form...
 
**Mordred:**
Last time I was here, I didn't see any floating books like that. 
 
**Jekyll:**
May I speak? This is just a guess,but I think those are a type of transformed grimoire. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Maybe the Demonic Fog transformed the tomes that were kept underground with the Mage's Association. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Oh...I was thinking the same thing, but he said it first...)
 
**Andersen:**
...A swarm of attacking books, huh? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
...It was like a nightmare, or perhaps a vision of hell. 
 
**Andersen:**
Don't be stupid. Those things weren't even...
 
**Andersen:**
...
 
**Shakespeare:**
......
 
**Mordred:**
Haha. What's wrong, authors? You're not running your mouths like usual? 
 
**Andersen:**
...I'm holding back. No, forget it. Forget it! Wow, that felt good! That felt great! 
 
**Mordred:**
Hmm? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
To burn a book! It is something inconceivable! Oh, how sad...but there was a joy in it! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Wrongdoings that should ne'er be done. Unforgivable acts of barbarism! There should only be sadness, yet...
 
**Shakespeare:**
I cannot help but feel a moment of forbidden joy! Oh, my God! 
 
**Andersen:**
No books are needed except my own. Actually, I'd prefer to even burn my own works! 
 
**Andersen:**
If there were no books in the world! No need to lament of the many great works I'll never read! 
 
**Andersen:**
If there were no books in the world! I'd never have to scream, "Who published this trash!? "
 
**Andersen:**
If there were no books in the world! I'd never have to worry about deadlines! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
What an honest man! Oh, but his words strike me in my heart! 
 
**Fou:**
Fo, fooou...
 
**Mordred:**
W-What's gotten into them? 
 
**Jekyll:**
This is kind of amazing...Really...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Authors are twisted. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Authors are creatures of paradox? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway, Senpai. This makes our path clear, doesn't it? 
 
**Mash:**
When the book-type enemies appeared,they formed a path to the underground by chance&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. Once the author Heroic Spirits calm down,it's time to go underground! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm so excited. This is like the headquarters of the Mage's Association. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wonder what it's like down there? Oh, I wish I could go and see for myself. 
 
**Mordred:**
Then you should come. Instead of just being a voice. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-I...um...I have to observe, and keep Chaldea running...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
O-Okay! Back to my observation work! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, Kyukyu...
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Jekyll:**
...It's like an endless dungeon, huh? 
 
**Andersen:**
It's dark. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Indeed, and the air is awfully wet. 
 
**Mordred:**
That's what mage dwellings are like, right? Everybody knows they like it dark and damp. 
 
**Mash:**
Do they? 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu, kyaau! Fou! 
 
**Mordred:**
The rodent is agreeing with me. It says this sure feels like where a mage lives. Right? 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu! 
 
**Mash:**
Fou? You seem kind of excited...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does he feel something? 
 
**Fou:**
Kyukyu...Kyaau...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He really is agreeing with Mordred. 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu, kyaau! Kyuu! 
 
**Mash:**
That's right. I wonder if Fou has taken a liking to Mordred. 
 
**Fou:**
Foou...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The endless dark corridors might be because, well, we're choosing to walk down corridors not blocked by debris. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All the entrances to the rooms are smashed,or filled with rubble...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It feels like someone destroyed this place thoroughly. There's not a single surviving mage. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If that theory's correct, the enemy should have sent someone down here. And they&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
They might still be here, huh? Looks like you're right. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
Magical energy response detected! Senpai, something's around the corner! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Time for combat! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is a closed area, so be careful! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Roger, Master! 
 
**Andersen:**
Hmmph. I'll help you this time. Don't expect it all the time, though. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jekyll:**
Mr. Andersen. This door is&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
I'm sensing magical energy. Yeah, this is it. A warded entrance to a library. 
 
**Andersen:**
It's not blocked with rubble either. Excellent. I hope what I'm after is here, but that's up to chance. 
 
**Andersen:**
Saber, Mash Kyrielight,and Fujimaru. 
 
**Andersen:**
Jekyll and I are going inside. Guard the door. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Leave it to us! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. 
 
**Mordred:**
Find what you're after quickly and get back here. I'm not sure when the enemy might show&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
...And there they are now! Flying books, and even a Helter Skelter! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Multiple moving responses! Th-This is not good! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're rushing in one after another. Can't assess the total amount! Andersen, escape once you find the reference you're after! 
 
**Andersen:**
Oh...I don't know about that. This is a problem. 
 
**Jekyll:**
This is...This is indeed a problem...I see. So that's how they guard the books. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? Stop being pompous and tell us what's going on! 
 
**Jekyll:**
The library books are warded by special, powerful spells. They can't leave this room! We can't go through the door! 
 
**Andersen:**
Luckily, I have several good guesses for the references I seek. But, oh...These are...
 
**Andersen:**
..."Wait a while for me to finish reading them. "
 
**Mordred:**
WHAT!? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
One scans information deep in the mystic garden! The other guards the door against a horde of foes! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
On one side, a battle of knowledge! On another, a battle of strength! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
This is truly a situation that entrances one's heart! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, which side should I stand on? Which should I see, that I can record in a book! 
 
**Mordred:**
Just shut up and fight over here! They're coming! 
 
**Mash:**
...This is a defensive battle! Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
That's most of 'em&mdash;No, wait. There's more? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's more! The layout down here puts you at a huge disadvantage! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy's just going to keep coming! And you have to defend a single point! 
 
**Mash:**
We're okay for now, but if this drags out it'll be bad. Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We can't leave yet! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just hang in a little more! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Roger, Master! Continuing battle! 
 
**Andersen:**
Just a little more, Fujimaru! I'm at the best part. It's all for nothing if we leave now. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Badly outnumbered! The ideal situation for a hero,but this is&mdash;
 
**Shakespeare:**
This is perhaps a bit too many. I'm about to run out of magical energy. Actually, I already have. 
 
**Mordred:**
Wha&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
...Oh, fine. I wanted to avoid this if I could, but...
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Huh? Jekyll, why are you coming out into the hall? 
 
**Mordred:**
There's nothing a would-be mage can do here! Get back in the library! 
 
**Jekyll:**
I told you. I have an ace-in-the-hole. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou!? 
 
**Mash:**
Jekyll, that's&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
An elixir. A "special" one I made. First you do this...and then inject it...like this...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-What!? A strange magical energy response suddenly spawned there!? 
 
**Fou:**
Fo&ndash;u! Kyau! 
 
**Jekyll:**
Haha&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
Hehehe, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It's been so long since I've been outside! HERE I AM!! 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh!? 
 
**Mash:**
!!!!?!?!? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Jekyll? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, that was Mr. Jekyll...Mr. Henry Jekyll! But the way he changed is "just like in the book"...
 
**Hyde:**
I'm "Hyde! " If I don't like you, I kill you! You get in my way, I kill you! Kill! Kill! Kill! 
 
**Hyde:**
HYAHAHAHAHAHAH! I'LL KILL YOU, HELTER SKELTER&ndash;! 
 
**Mordred:**
...He ran right at the enemy. He's just like a Berserker. Not bad! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Elixir-induced transformation. I see, truly Jekyll and Hyde! But physical transformation must put an awful strain on him! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't think it'll last long...Andersen, you better hurry up! 
 
**Andersen:**
I understand. Don't hurry me. 
 
**Andersen:**
Reading should be done at one's own pace. Yes, alone, and in a quiet room&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
Hmm. It's not quiet. The noise outside is bothering me. 
 
**Mordred:**
You don't understand at all! Just hurry up! 
 
**Mordred:**
...Damn it. Shieldy, we'll follow Jekyll! 
 
**Mash:**
Right. &mdash;Senpai! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Work together and don't go too deep! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't let Hyde get away! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Roger, Master! Continuing combat! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Enemy units destroyed! 
 
**Jekyll:**
...We're done, huh? Whew, I don't think...I can do anymore...
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, you're back to normal. 
 
**Jekyll:**
There was a chance I wouldn't come back, so I'm glad I did. Is Andersen's book-reading&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
I'm done. I finished decoding most of the documents I was after. 
 
**Andersen:**
Besides, there were also several interesting books. I satisfied my personal curiosity, too. Great work, guys. 
 
**Mordred:**
Personal curiosity? 
 
**Fou:**
...Fou......Fo...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What a free spirit Andersen is...There's something impressive in his lack of shame. However...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-You need to get out of here! There are more enemies coming! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Break away, Mash! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good work. Let's get out of here. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. Let's return to the surface right away. 
 
**Andersen:**
Once again, good work. Let's return to the apartment and I'll share the results. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
&mdash;Okay! I've recovered! Now it's time for me to rejoin the heroes' battle as well! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh? Are you all ready to return home? 
 
**Mordred:**
That's right! We're leaving, damn it! 
 
**Andersen:**
And so you see&mdash;Your efforts have answered a certain question. 
 
**Andersen:**
Again, you have my thanks. Thank you, Fujimaru, Mash, Saber. 
 
**Mordred:**
Y-Yeah. 
 
**Andersen:**
My wallet is so empty I can't reward you a single penny,but I hope these observations are worth it. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Yes, I'm looking forward to them, Mr. Andersen. Enough to forget all this muscle pain. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou. 
 
**Andersen:**
In light of Mr. Jekyll's urgent need for rest,I'll get right to the point. 
 
**Andersen:**
What bothered me in the first place was the relationship between "Heroic Spirits" and "Servants. "
 
**Andersen:**
Heroic Spirits are records or results of human history. 
 
**Andersen:**
Be they real or fictional,they'll exist as long as humanity does. 
 
**Andersen:**
But a Servant is something different. This treats a Heroic Spirit as an "existence" in reality...
 
**Andersen:**
A familiar given a container called a Class and "made real," when its existence is uncertain to begin with. 
 
**Andersen:**
But I ask you, Jekyll and Roman, was it? Is such a thing possible with the powers of a human, a mage? 
 
**Andersen:**
Turning a Heroic Spirit into a familiar&mdash;I see,that's powerful. The strongest summoning spell imaginable. 
 
**Andersen:**
But a human couldn't handle such a spell on their own. If it's possible, it would be&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A being greater than humans. An "Authority" exercised by a supernatural being, labeled as world or god. Is that it? 
 
**Andersen:**
Indeed. Heroic Spirits can't be summoned with human power alone. There needs to be some other reason&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
It needs an extra push from something else, I think. 
 
**Mash:**
...Um. Isn't that the Holy Grail? 
 
**Mash:**
It's a fact that up to this point, many Servants have been summoned thanks to the Holy Grail. 
 
**Andersen:**
Indeed. You spoke of the seven Singularities. Seven Holy Grails driving the different eras mad. 
 
**Andersen:**
That's why I asked Dr. Roman about the Holy Grail. 
 
**Andersen:**
What exactly is the Holy Grail War that enables Heroic Spirit Summons? For what reason was it created? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup. I don't have detailed data, but the origin is a town in rural Japan. The flaming city you visited, Fujimaru. 
 
**Andersen:**
There, they made a vessel for the Holy Grail, used its power to summon Heroic Spirits, who they had compete as Servants. 
 
**Andersen:**
That's what seemed weird to me. There's a flaw in the concept of making Heroic Spirits fight each other. 
 
**Andersen:**
It felt like there was something else going on. So I decided to read the Mage's Association archives. 
 
**Andersen:**
And I found what I expected. 
 
**Andersen:**
The original Heroic Spirit summoning ritual was a ceremony to pit seven powers against one. 
 
**Andersen:**
It wasn't something where seven Heroic Spirits fought one another. 
 
**Andersen:**
"Ritual: Heroic Spirit Summon" and "Ritual: Holy Grail War" are the same systems with different genres, you could say. 
 
**Andersen:**
"Holy Grail War" altered an existing spell and used it for selfish human purposes. 
 
**Andersen:**
Meanwhile, it's base spell "Heroic Spirit Summon"...
 
**Andersen:**
...was a ritual to put "humanity's strongest seven Heroic Spirits" against "a single powerful enemy. "
 
**Andersen:**
That's what got distorted in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Then you and the others are also? 
 
**Andersen:**
Yeah. Since there are only supposed to be seven of them, all the Heroic Spirits that got summoned later&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
Well, they're cheap, convenient,multi-purpose familiars. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...So um...What? 
 
**Andersen:**
...For now, just know that the Ritual: Holy Grail War was based off of something else. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, I see! I see! An interesting theory. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Chaldea wasn't able to make its own summoning system from the ground up. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We modified and stabilized the Fuyuki ritual,but never considered the possibility of an older original. 
 
**Fou:**
Foou! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Doctor. This is a viewpoint we've never heard before. 
 
**Mash:**
It casts doubt about the fundamental nature of the Holy Grail War. 
 
**Mash:**
I thought I knew what Heroic Spirits were originally. But it was nothing more than information&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
It wasn't nearly at the level of what you just pointed out. That's very impressive, Mr. Andersen. 
 
**Mash:**
I guess this is the keen eye of observation owned by an author that left his name in history. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe so. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What you'd call an objective perspective? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
I don't know if it's that special. Anyway...That's fine, but you know...
 
**Mordred:**
This doesn't help us do anything about the mass-production of those Helter Skelters. 
 
**Mash:**
Th...That's...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Well, that's true. 
 
**Andersen:**
Of course it is. I just felt a hitch with the Heroic Spirit summoning system. 
 
**Andersen:**
If we're all normal Classes summoned by a single system&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
I wondered what kind of Spirit Origins the original seven for this system must have had. 
 
**Andersen:**
...And someone else thought the same thing. 
 
**Andersen:**
I don't think it's coincidence that information about this,even the parts you'd expect to be lost, was all in one place. 
 
**Andersen:**
"Someone" predicted our coming,and put it there. 
 
**Mash:**
Someone? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Who could it be? A surviving mage of the Clock Tower? Or a Servant? 
 
**Andersen:**
I don't think it would be a mage, but I don't know why a Servant would do it. We'll have to set that aside for now. 
 
## Section 9: Opportunity 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hm...It seems I'm picking up interference on my mic,but speak of the devil? I detect multiple hostiles around you. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are more roaming around the apartment than earlier...Enough magical energy distortion to disturb communications. 
 
**Mash:**
This mechanical sound&mdash;I believe it's a group of Helter Skelters. 
 
**Andersen:**
I doubt they'll break in, but they are a nuisance. Get out there and dismantle them. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do it! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll finish them off quickly. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. Intercepting them in the alley. Let's reduce their numbers. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Good work. We drove off the Helter Skelters. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mmm. Mmm? Wait...Hold on a second, um...So that means...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Helter Skelters? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. That's it! Actually, I've made progress on the Helter Skelter analysis! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As expected, they're machines created by technology unknown to us. I suspect they were built&ndash;with magical energy. 
 
**Mash:**
You mean...machines created with a combination of magecraft and science? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not exactly. They are made by magical energy, but they are machines. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I still don't understand the kind of techniques used but structurally, they're machines. Yet, they were formed by magecraft. 
 
**Jekyll:**
In other words...Um...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean? 
 
**Jekyll:**
I don't really understand...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe like Noble Phantasms? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Exactly! Good insight! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...In other words, they're armaments made of magical energy, just like Servants' Noble Phantasms, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. They're half-baked mechanical constructions,which is why I was looking too hard for magecraft-made golem approximations. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Basically, they're Noble Phantasms. Powerful figures woven from magical energy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unlike a sword Noble Phantasm that is a "razor edge,"Helter Skelters are "fighting machine" Noble Phantasms. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It looks like they operate autonomously, but they're actually controlled by someone like the Noble Phantasm's owner. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're a remote-controlled robotic squad, so to say. All units should stop if we break the acting controller. 
 
**Mash:**
Then, considerable exceptions aside, if we beat the Servant possessing the Noble Phantasm&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
The robots will disappear. Well, we can see the whole picture now, huh? 
 
**Mash:**
So Doctor,where is the Servant who owns the Noble Phantasm? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I don't know. 
 
**Jekyll:**
...Yes. Right, you wouldn't know. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not even Da Vinci knows, or rather, she said she can't clean up my mess anymore...
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Mmm? 
 
**Mordred:**
What, someone else did the analysis? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Uuh, that's right...After all, I wasn't getting anywhere on my own...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm a medical staff...Considering that, don't you think I'm doing pretty well? 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes. You're making a great effort, Doctor. Right, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you, thank you...Fujimaru...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where the Servant with the Noble Phantasm is...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uuh...I feel so lonely...
 

---

 
**Fran:**
...Uhh......Uh, uh, uhrrr...
 
**Mordred:**
We know what we have to do. Yes. But, we don't know our destination. Do we? 
 
**Fran:**
...Urh...
 
**Mordred:**
What should we do? If we could trace the magical energy in one shot...
 
**Mash:**
If the example of a remote control is correct,then maybe we can trace the magical energy back. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Da Vinci, wise in the ways of science and magecraft,brought up that example, so I imagine it's right. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But with the effect of the Demonic Fog, doing something subtle like tracing marks of magical energy...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is not something I can do. It's rather difficult even with Chaldea's equipment. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I give up, too. I'm not a real mage in the first place. 
 
**Fran:**
...Urh...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fran's been making noise...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Somebody here has something to say. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Fran? You're hiding over there...Is something wrong? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh......Uhh, urrrh...
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, she fled from the literary Heroic Spirits next door? I know how she feels. They are annoying. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh......Uhh, urrrh...
 
**Mordred:**
Don't hide, show your face here. Come on now. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh, uhhh...
 
**Mordred:**
What, you have something to say to us? Then spit it out. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh...
 
**Mash:**
I don't mind. As long as you're fine with us,right, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You can tell us anything. 
 

---

 
**Fran:**
...Uhh, urrrh...Ahh...
 
**Fran:**
...Ahh...
 
**Fran:**
...Ahh, uhh...Urhhh, uhh...
 
**Fran:**
...Ahh, ahh, ahhh...
 
**Mordred:**
Wha...Is that true!? 
 
**Mash:**
I'm shocked. Fran, I had no idea you could do that...
 
**Jekyll:**
???
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Tell me, do you really understand? Do you really understand what she's saying? 
 
**Mash:**
Somewhat. She also uses gestures,so it's like reading a kind of sign language...
 
**Mordred:**
It seems she knows where the Helter Skelter's remote control is. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh!? 
 
**Jekyll:**
R-Really? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh...
 
**Jekyll:**
Let me double-check. Fran, can you...detect traces of the magical energy that controls them? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh. Uhh. 
 
**Mordred:**
There, you see? She nodded. All right, this makes things easier. Let's get moving! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...You know, even though I've gotten used to it,this poor visibility is irritating. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh. 
 
**Mordred:**
Say, Fujimaru. Your court mage...Dr. Maron, was it? 
 
**Mordred:**
Can't he make us a far-seeing crystal or something? That would have been a snap for Merlin...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Roman! My name is Roman! And don't compare me to Merlin! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He was the ultimate hermit wizard! I'm just a modern-day doctor! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Margarine? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Marmalade? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Huh!? You're a mage and you're saying you don't know!? Merlin! I'm talking about Merlin! 
 
**Mordred:**
King Arthur's successor and mastermind of the Round Table. He was a great mage born half-human, half-incubus. 
 
**Mordred:**
He isn't famous anymore? Haha! That feels great! Serves him right! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Merlin was one of the world's most renowned kingmakers. He was also behind Arthur pulling the sword from the stone. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Apparently, he had extraordinary magecraft skills, but was ultimately imprisoned at world's end for woman trouble. 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. I heard he's all crabby and in a tower at a corner of Avalon, unable to leave or die. 
 
**Mordred:**
How can I put it? He was a flighty bastard. Imagine a perpetual flurry of flowers behind him...do you get me? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I do. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Well, whatever. Enough about him. He's so spineless he can't even rush over to London's calamity. 
 
**Mordred:**
...More importantly. Tell me, Fujimaru, are you okay with that? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay with what? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's wrong? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
(Mash, I'm talking about Mash. You see how depressed she looks? Go talk to her. )
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong, Mash? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You seem down, Mash. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Physically, there's nothing wrong with me, but......mentally, I have a problem. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry, Senpai. Our battles are getting more intense,but I haven't been improving at all...
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Mash:**
...It's my Noble Phantasm. Servants' true fighting powers lie in Noble Phantasms. 
 
**Mash:**
I've seen many Noble Phantasms up till now. All of them have been miracles worthy of their heroic names. 
 
**Mash:**
Yet, I still&mdash;can't use my Noble Phantasm properly. 
 
**Mash:**
...At this rate, I'm just a burden. I know that,but I still can't remember his True Name...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even without a Noble Phantasm...
 
**Mash:**
No, I need a Noble Phantasm! 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, um...I'm sorry I yelled at you. But it will definitely become necessary...that's my hunch. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's not your fault, Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
...Indeed, the merge was due to a sudden accident. But he entrusted me with everything...
 
**Mash:**
The point is, I'm not oblivious of the Noble Phantasm's true value. I don't even know his True Name...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
So that's what this is about. You heard Helter Skelter is a Noble Phantasm and became depressed. 
 
**Mordred:**
True, a Servant who cannot use a Noble Phantasm is no Servant at all. 
 
**Mordred:**
No matter how weak the Noble Phantasm, its very existence is proof of that hero. It's a matter of pride. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Mordred:**
But you're different, Mash. You're you. How you think and your honor are different from that Shield bastard. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's true you haven't mastered using that Noble Phantasm. From what I've seen, you're about a third of the way there. 
 
**Mordred:**
The remaining two-thirds are untapped. Or maybe you,being you, won't get to 100% and that's that. 
 
**Mash:**
...So it is like that. 
 
**Mash:**
The "Demi" side...The human part of me is dragging Senpai down...
 
**Mordred:**
Fool. That's ridiculous. Listen until I'm done talking. 
 
**Mordred:**
You're not fully utilizing your Noble Phantasm. But I'm sure&mdash;you're stronger than the original Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? The original Heroic Spirit...You mean the Heroic Spirit that I merged with? 
 
**Mordred:**
Yes. You're much, much stronger than him. That's coming from me, so there's no doubt about it. 
 
**Mordred:**
You may come up short not having a Noble Phantasm,but not anywhere else. Am I right, Fujimaru? 
 
**Mordred:**
For you,Mash is the perfect partner, isn't she? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do something about that Noble Phantasm! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...I-Is that really the case? 
 
**Mash:**
...Okay. If that's the case, I feel much better. 
 
**Mordred:**
There, you see? In the first place, it's a Master's job to take care of their Servant. 
 
**Mordred:**
Whether you can utilize the true value of a Noble Phantasm is Fujimaru's problem, not yours, Mash. 
 
**Mordred:**
Right, Fujimaru? 
 
**Mordred:**
Before Mash can become a full-fledged Servant,you need to become a first-rate Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll be first-rate together. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll teach you how to use it eventually. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fouuu! 
 
**Mordred:**
There you go. So don't worry about it, Mash. 
 
**Mordred:**
Fujimaru is the one who's sitting in the hot seat. 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Right! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...All right, can we get moving soon? I'm sorry, as everyone is in a good mood, but...
 
**Mash:**
Ah...
 
**Mordred:**
Hmmph. Fujimaru, summon a Rider Servant and have it give Maron a swift kick with its hind legs. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, yeah, it's all my fault. My fault! Now, time for combat. Multiple hostile readings approaching! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Go rout them to liven things up! 
 
## Section 10: At the End of Brilliant Steam 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh...
 
**Mash:**
That direction. Got it.... Senpai, it seems we want to go west from here. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
West is...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe the Westminster area? 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Yes, probably the Westminster area. That's where we'll find the Houses of Parliament. 
 
**Mordred:**
Let's go there and pound them down. Ah. But first. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes? 
 
**Mordred:**
There's one thing I need to say. This time, my hands are tied protecting Fran. 
 
**Mordred:**
You see, she's not a Servant, and it's unknown how much damage an artificial human can take. 
 
**Mordred:**
So "I'm going to protect her. "...We have a strange connection. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We can't count on Mordred during the battle then,so you guys will have to provide all the muscle. Be careful! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No problem. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right. Okay then, Senpai. Let's move out! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...To think it's really near the Houses of Parliament. What a place for a remote control. Is it actually inside? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh, uhrrr! 
 
**Mash:**
Looks like it's close. She says it's in our immediate vicinity&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Look, there's a gargantuan one! Fran, get behind me and stay there! 
 
**Mordred:**
Mash, Fujimaru! I'm leaving this one to you. Take it apart! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger that. Master, it's combat with a giant hostile. Awaiting orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;All giant hostile targets have gone silent. 
 
**Mash:**
It appears it wasn't a Servant...But, was this the Noble Phantasm that's manipulating the others? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh.... Uh, uhh. 
 
**Mordred:**
It seems so. Okay, that's one nuisance out of the way. 
 
**Mordred:**
Good work. Fran. We pulled through thanks to you. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh. Ah...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, Fujimaru. Just in case,could you send me some visual data of the remains? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll go ahead and analyze them here. Well, I'm just going to ask Da Vinci about them. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. 
 
**Mash:**
...Doctor. We discovered something strange. Something that the other Helter Skelters did not possess. 
 
**Mash:**
Perhaps the manufacturer's name? It's written in English. 
 
**Mash:**
"Charles Babbage, AD 1888"
 
**Fran:**
...Uh!!? 
 
**Mordred:**
Hmm. What's wrong, Fran? 
 
**Fran:**
......
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. Did you sleep well? 
 
**Mash:**
It seems like you went by yourself to the nap room a little earlier...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I couldn't sleep much. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Those author Heroic Spirits were there...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Oh...um, that's right...The two Heroic Spirit authors are occupying that room...
 
**Mash:**
In that case, you probably didn't get much rest. I-I'm sorry I didn't notice. 
 
**Mash:**
I...wish I had let you use the sofa in the living room that was assigned to me...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm glad it worked out this way. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai...
 
**Mordred:**
Mm. Both of you are awake. Hey, have you seen Fran around? 
 
**Mash:**
Come to think of it...Oh! Senpai, maybe Fran...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In the next room. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
In the authors' room. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
...Well, if she's fine with that, it's fine. I myself have no intention of entering that room. 
 
**Mash:**
That room gives off a kind of odd ambience. I wonder if that's the power of authors with looming deadlines. 
 
**Mordred:**
They've basically just been writing since materializing. Though I'm not sure if Andersen is really working or not. 
 
**Mash:**
I couldn't help but sense a strange pressure coming from that room...
 
**Jekyll:**
Good morning, everyone. Looks like you all got some rest. 
 
**Jekyll:**
There's something we need to talk about, okay? It's the name you found a few hours earlier. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Charles Babbage, right? He was an outstanding British scientist and mathematician of the 19th century. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Yes. He belongs to this age. I haven't met him myself, but I recall a few things. 
 
**Jekyll:**
I'm sure that he and the original Dr. Victor Frankenstein were acquaintances. 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;I'm sorry, but please wait. 
 
**Mash:**
Babbage was supposed to have passed away at least a decade prior to our present time. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Huh? No, that's strange. He may be old, but he should still be an active scholar in good health. 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Jekyll, are you sure that's not a lapse in your memory? Are you really sure that Babbage is a man of this era? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Of course. I came across his name while perusing this year's Royal Society Almanac. Victor also spoke of him. 
 
**Jekyll:**
So I can't imagine he's dead. His inventions were featured in newspapers from last year and this year, too. 
 
**Mash:**
Allow me to confirm this. Let's see, yes, a newspaper will do. 
 
**Mash:**
...Indeed, there is an article here. Charles Babbage. Born 1791. This is the very man in question. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can think of two possibilities. One is that our historical records do not match reality. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Another is that a "shift" of events has occurred. That, in fact, has occurred in all the previous eras. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Orleans, Rome, even Okeanos. The events were all slightly distorted and "shifted. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Due to events changing, the dead are still alive and not there as Heroic Spirits&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's possible. The same applies to those who died from the Demonic Fog. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It may be that 20th century events have shifted all the way into this era. 
 
**Mash:**
So...in the case of Fran, as well as Mr. Jekyll? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We can't rule it out. So who belongs to this era, and who doesn't? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's extremely difficult to determine. Especially when there are no records left in existence&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
Hmm. Are you talking about me? I'm curious, but we'll talk about it later. I've received some emergency correspondence. 
 
**Jekyll:**
It's bad news from my information network. Saber, this concerns you too. 
 
**Jekyll:**
All the Helter Skelters that had been completely shut down&mdash;have reactivated. 
 
**Mordred:**
What, again? So there was another remote control elsewhere? 
 
**Mash:**
...This is indeed an emergency. We need to deactivate them again as quickly as possible. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. There's no way we can let the enemy procure any other Servants that materialize from the fog. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, Fujimaru, I'm counting on you. Make sure you stop the Helter Skelters for good this time! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 
**Mordred:**
But, having said that,we've got Fran on our side. We can dodge the enemy. 
 
**Mordred:**
Do the same thing as last time. Head straight to the remote without encountering enemies. 
 
**Fran:**
......
 
**Mash:**
You're right. Let's hurry, but be careful no to let our guard down. 
 
**Mordred:**
I won't. Then again, thinking of Fran's precision last time&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, we're running into them already? We haven't reached the remote-controlled ones yet, right? 
 
**Mash:**
...Machine sounds ahead. Several large-type units! It's an enemy group. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Enemy group defeated. It seems like we're being attacked more frequently. 
 
**Mordred:**
The enemy just keeps on coming...Fran, what's wrong? Are you not feeling so good? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...
 
**Mordred:**
So next we head east...Seems like you're pointing in more directions than before. 
 
**Mordred:**
If something's wrong, it's okay to say so. Like I said, just be frank with us. 
 
**Fran:**
...
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...We defeated the enemy group. We believe the attack frequency has been rising. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, is this&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's probably Fran. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, I suppose so. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe the properties of the magical circuits changed? 
 
**Mash:**
I don't know. But, if you allow me to state...my personal theory...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I do believe that...Fran is the cause. She's hesitating when it comes to directional commands. 
 
**Mash:**
Isn't that right...Fran? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...
 
**Mordred:**
......
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mordred:**
...Fran. We need to talk. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh. 
 
**Mordred:**
You have no intention of leading us to the remote, do you? It's obvious at this point. 
 
**Mash:**
Is that true? Fran&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. She's hesitating about something. One more thing. 
 
**Mordred:**
There's something she hasn't told us. Right, Fran? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh.... Uhh, uh, uh. 
 
**Mordred:**
...Look, I've said this so many times now. You haven't forgotten, right? 
 
**Mordred:**
If you have something on your mind or something to say, be frank with us. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, it's okay to talk to us. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We want you to tell us. 
 

---

 
**Fran:**
...Uh...
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh...uhh...
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh...ah...ah...ah, ah...uhh...
 
**Fran:**
...Uhh...
 
**Mordred:**
...
 
**Mash:**
...Oh. Right. That's what it was. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is she saying? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't understand...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
She knows a man named Babbage. She has apparently even talked to him in person. 
 
**Mash:**
She can trace the magical energy because she's tracing something resembling his presence. 
 
**Mash:**
But, he is not the type to do these kinds of things. That's what she's saying. 
 
**Mordred:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Mr. Jekyll said just as much. I also should have noticed at that point...
 
**Mordred:**
...I get it. You're covering for him. Isn't that right, Fran? 
 
**Mordred:**
But, your own actions are contradictory. Babbage isn't the type to do "these kinds of things," right? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh. 
 
**Mordred:**
Well then, it's simple.... I hate to quote that stupid brat, but I have no choice. 
 
**Mordred:**
Fran. Calm down. Try using your imagination. You can do that much, right? 
 
**Mordred:**
Babbage isn't the type to act like this. Yet, Helter Skelters are wandering around everywhere. 
 
**Mordred:**
So, that means he's being forced into this. To do "these kinds of things. "
 
**Fran:**
...Uh! 
 
**Mordred:**
Okay, good girl. So, you understand what you need to do, right? 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That settles it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's find the remote this time. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai! 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;It's close. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I can tell, too. The magical energy is concentrated here, even in the Demonic Fog. 
 
**Mordred:**
Look, over there. I'm sure Fujimaru will also hear it soon. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I detected it here as well! It's a giant response,and almost right in front of you. To think it was there! 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh, it was in the center of the City Area. It was right near the apartment. 
 
**Mordred:**
Well then, it's time for us to meet. Either it's the other remote, or&mdash;
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh! 
 
**Babbage:**
&mdash;Listen, listen, listen! I am the King of Steam. 
 
**Babbage:**
Unable to grasp the future that lay within reach,I am the king of an evanescent world of fantasy. 
 
**Babbage:**
I am known to you rabble as the mage "B". I am a mastermind behind "Project Demonic Fog" that's enveloping this city. 
 
**Babbage:**
Furthermore&mdash;I am a Heroic Spirit emerged from the Demonic Fog of the empire's capital. 
 
**Mash:**
...Mage "B? "
 
**Mordred:**
...One of the enemy bosses, huh. Damn, I didn't see that coming. 
 
**Mordred:**
True, your name starts with "B. " I see. I was overthinking and missed something so simple. 
 
**Mash:**
However, this...Is the same shape as a Helter Skelter? 
 
**Mordred:**
This guy's specs are probably way higher. Just a hunch, but my hunches are usually right. 
 
**Mash:**
He does not seem human. So he must be...a Servant! 
 
**Babbage:**
I am the King of Steam. Having died once, I now dwell within a world of fantasy. 
 
**Babbage:**
My fantasies have sublimated to a Reality Marble,but it's not enough. It's not enough. It's still not enough. 
 
**Babbage:**
Behold how I desire. Behold how I struggle. 
 
**Babbage:**
With steel, I seek to lead a steam-filled civilization. With ideas, I seek to lead an inconceivable civilization. 
 
**Babbage:**
And&mdash;I lament the incineration of humanity and civilization, of the world and the future. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, so that's it! It means that he himself is already a Reality Marble! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's similar to the Magical Tome. Though, the Magical Tome distributed sleep to materialize. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He will continue to disperse his alter egos infinitely. Most likely, that's&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Mr. Babbage. If what you say is the truth,we can reason with each other. 
 
**Mash:**
We are the same. The future should not be burned to ashes! 
 
**Mordred:**
Enough gabbing. Listen up, you big piece of scrap iron. 
 
**Mordred:**
The daughter of someone you know has come to stop you. 
 
**Mordred:**
Listen to what she has to say. Your pompous speeches and everything can come after that. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh! 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...uhh, ah...ah, ah! 
 
**Fran:**
...Ah, ah, ah! 
 
**Babbage:**
&mdash;Oh, I see. I could never forget Victor's daughter. &mdash;Are you there? 
 
**Babbage:**
Lovely little artificial human. Piteous being unloved by your creator, thus craving love. 
 
**Babbage:**
Ah, I can hear your words. Ah, I can hear your thoughts. 
 
**Babbage:**
That's right&mdash;I...no, we, must fulfill our aspirations as scholars. 
 
**Babbage:**
We exist for the sake of humanity and civilization. Thus, I sought...a fantasy world, a new era of dreams. 
 
**Babbage:**
Thus...
 
**Babbage:**
Gah!? 
 
**Babbage:**
...Ugh...uh...ughh, ugh...ugh!? What...is this...Angrboda's interference!? 
 
**Babbage:**
The Holy Grail that was implanted! I see, so "M"...so even I! 
 
**Babbage:**
Victor's daughter! Run...for your life! 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh! 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Enough, Fran. 
 
**Mordred:**
You said what needed to be said,and he replied in his own way. You did a good job. 
 
**Mordred:**
But, sometimes it ends up like this. Your feelings don't get conveyed, and you must settle things with swords...
 
**Mordred:**
Sometimes it just turns out this way. 
 
**Babbage:**
Arghh! 
 
**Mash:**
...Here he comes! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Communication breakdown, and now a battle!? This is a similar reaction when a Command Spell has been used&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If this is the Holy Grail's doing, then we have no choice but to defeat him. Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, your orders. Commencing battle with a large-type Servant! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We have no choice! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's stop him! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Yes, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Babbage:**
...Head to the underground part of the city. 
 
**Babbage:**
...Deep, deep, deep beneath the Underground, in the depths...There...lies the core of..."Project Demonic Fog"...
 
**Babbage:**
The source of the Fog...covering the city...Namely, my invention...Massive Steam Engine Angrboda...
 
**Babbage:**
The Holy Grail...was used as the power source for...Angrboda...
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...uhh...ah. 
 
**Babbage:**
...Sorry, daughter of Victor. 
 
**Babbage:**
I heard your voice...but I am no longer a human...with a proper life...
 
**Babbage:**
...but an improbable Servant...of irrelevant thoughts...
 
**Mordred:**
...
 
**Babbage:**
...I...
 
**Babbage:**
...Oh, I have seen a dream of my world......But...Even that...
 
**Babbage:**
...Even in a world where my dream will not be realized...I do not wish to end your world...
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Looks like we have the next destination. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, underground. That's what Mr. Babbage told us. 
 
**Mordred:**
Let's get Fran back to Jekyll's apartment first. Then we'll take out the final boss. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do that. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're surely getting that Holy Grail. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Senpai. 
 
## Section 11: Angrboda 
 
**Mordred:**
...Under Londinium, huh? 
 
**Mordred:**
I knew there was a subway underground, but who'd have thought there'd be something "under" that. 
 
**Mordred:**
And how dense this Demonic Fog is...Isn't it getting thicker the lower we go? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not sure. I can't observe from here,but if it's getting dense enough to visually confirm...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then maybe what Babbage said was true. After all, there really was a path leading below. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why is this here in London? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was this made by the Mage's Association? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
London has had an underground transportation network since the middle of the 19th century. 
 
**Mash:**
But there are no records of underground passages like this.... Perhaps the remnant of a national top secret project? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Mage's Association only excavated the area right under the British Museum...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hard to think an individual secretly built an underground labyrinth, so maybe this existed before London took shape? 
 
**Mordred:**
There's this old story. Deep underneath the Tower of London&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
The head of an ancient king of Britain named Bran is buried, and it watches over Londinium. 
 
**Mash:**
A head, huh...
 
**Mordred:**
Interesting story, huh? The Tower of London has other stories, like the crows. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, I know a bit about that one. They watch over London&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
They're said to be the avatar of my father, King Arthur. I mean they're crows! His avatars are crows! Ha ha! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? I think crows are really cool. Raven Master is really cool, right Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
Uhh...What do you think, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What? You're going to ask me? 
 
**Mash:**
...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pretty cool. 
 
**Mash:**
Right. I think so too, Senpai. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not really cool. 
 
**Mash:**
That's...true. No, I, well...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Setting crows aside, you can't track this underground passageway or routes from your end? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, just as Mash mentioned earlier,there are no records. You'll have to explore on your own. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hopefully it's not too complicated...But it already sounds like a labyrinth. 
 
**Mash:**
Deep underneath London...An unknown underground passage, underground labyrinth. 
 
**Mash:**
If what Mr. Babbage said was correct,then a "large-scaled machine" should exist. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Massive Steam Engine? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The source of Demonic Fog?

**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, the source of the Demonic Fog filling London. The Massive Steam Engine Angrboda, powered by a Holy Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's what he mentioned right before vanishing. To think a Holy Grail would be integrated into a machine...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, that makes some sense. The existence of a fog abnormally full of magical energy, and its proliferation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A strange situation that throws off a Servant's detection ability, and prevents various observations from Chaldea. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see, by using the power of the Holy Grail,something like that would be possible. 
 
**Mash:**
That may also explain the mechanism that materializes Servants from the Demonic Fog. 
 
**Mash:**
By incorporating the Holy Grail into a device,the Demonic Fog gained the ability to summon Heroic Spirits. 
 
**Mash:**
Such speculation is also possible. 
 
**Mordred:**
But Angrboda, huh? That's a grand old name. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Angrboda? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The one from Norse mythology. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, Angrboda is a Divinity from Norse mythology. They brought forth Fenrir, World Serpent, and the Goddess of Death among others. 
 
**Mordred:**
With Loki, right? An unbelievable woman giant, but I don't hate her. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's not often that you see someone give birth to so many troublesome beings&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Definitely worth punching. I'm sure she has thick skin too, so I can get down and hack her into pieces, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Oh, that's what you meant by "don't hate her"...)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(It's been so hard to retort to all this...I'm sure Mordred is saying everything on purpose)
 
**Mash:**
(Y-Yes. I believe Mordred's mother was...)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Yeah. A witch among witches. None other than Morgan! )
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Looks like they're finally here. Hostiles. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Beat me to it again. Detecting multiple targets! Looks like there aren't any more Helter Skelters. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Quality aside, they're coming in large quantities! Be careful! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger that. Master, starting combat! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...We've come pretty far down. This is the second level, isn't it? 
 
**Mash:**
We've travelled pretty far. We're most likely under Hyde Park now. 
 
**Mordred:**
Oh brother. We've walked quite a bit...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm mapping the whole thing here. You shouldn't be traveling in circles, at least. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Taking into account Fujimaru's stamina,you should probably take appropriate periods of rest. 
 
**Mordred:**
Doesn't look like we'll get that chance. They're here again. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We've got enemy signatures. Quite a few! It will be another series of battles. Be careful! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger that. Master, give me you orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...What level are we on now? 
 
**Mash:**
The fourth level. We went down a set of stairs earlier. 
 
**Mash:**
We're currently several hundred meters underground. 
 
**Mordred:**
We've gone pretty deep. Isn't it going to be a pain to go back up? 
 
**Mordred:**
...More hostiles again. It really is quantity over quality. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, give me your orders. Going to demolish the enemy group! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
What the hell is this? 
 
**Mash:**
...Almost identical to the Fuyuki Greater Grail. Incredible magical energy. 
 
**Mash:**
So much magical energy, I can feel it strongly even in the Demonic Fog. Such a giant Magical Reactor Core...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can observe it here, too. This is amazing. No doubt about it, "that's" what's creating the Fog. 
 
**Mordred:**
I've never seen a machine this big. Angrboda...The name of a giant fits perfectly. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'd love to take a closer look&mdash;But it looks like the last boss is here. 
 
**D：???:**
&mdash;Oddly enough. 
 
**D：???:**
Oddly enough, it is just as Paracelsus said. Evil must be stopped by those who do good. 
 
**D：???:**
The Massive Steam Engine, Angrboda. This is our evil embodied, but it is also our hope. 
 
**D：???:**
Your path ends here. Good will now be destroyed by our evil. 
 
**Mordred:**
You folks really like to talk. Shut up. What ends here is your life. 
 
**D：???:**
Heroic Spirit Mordred. The 13th Knight of the Round Table and legendary Treacherous King. 
 
**D：???:**
I thought you'd stand with us,but it seems you're now a hero of good. Ironic. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you "M"? 
 

---

 
**D：???:**
I am Makiri Zolgen. The first leader of this "Project Demonic Fog. "
 
**Makiri:**
One mage seeking the annihilation of this era&mdash;the Fourth Singularity, by releasing Demonic Fog all over England. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All of England!? So it's not just London! That's...I have to say, going to be tough...
 
**Makiri:**
Destroying London alone isn't enough. Only by destroying this era completely can I erase the Foundation of Humanity. 
 
**Makiri:**
That is our King's wish, and an act which we had no choice but to embrace after our surrender. 
 
**Mash:**
Our King...Master, is he part of the same group as Lev Lainur? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you're with Lev! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who is "Our King"!? 
 

---

 
**Makiri:**
There's no need to say another word. Angrboda is shifting to overload mode. 
 
**Makiri:**
A powerful Heroic Spirit, one sufficient to truly awaken the Demonic Fog that fills the city, will now materialize. 
 
**Makiri:**
A single strike from him shall activate the Demonic Fog,engulfing the world. "Everything" will meet its end. 
 
**Makiri:**
Now, behold. The Heroic Spirit we desire shall appear from the Demonic Fog shortly. 
 
**Makiri:**
A Pioneer of the Star, fitting for the end of the Myth of Humanity. Or perhaps, this planet's glimmer&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
I ain't letting that happen. I'll kill you, and destroy Angrboda. 
 
**Mordred:**
I'll never forgive someone other than myself for trampling over Britain. Even if you are a human. 
 
**Mash:**
!?!?!? He's not...a Servant!? 
 
**Mordred:**
Just a hunch. I told you they're usually right, remember? He's human. 
 
**Mordred:**
I don't know if he's rightfully from this era, or "shifted"like Babbage was. 
 
**Mash:**
Why are you doing this, Makiri Zolgen? Why are you destroying the era you live in&mdash;
 
**Makiri:**
Of course, I tried to resist. But I realized everything was useless. 
 
**Makiri:**
Even if I wished for the salvation of all humanity,the world where they should live has already been incinerated. 
 
**Makiri:**
Past, present, and future. Our King has decided not to allow them to exist. 
 
**Makiri:**
&mdash;All will be destroyed before it is achieved. 
 
**Makiri:**
The King has proclaimed to us that he tires of seeing more of this ugliness and existence. 
 
**Makiri:**
Then, before long...
 
**Makiri:**
No, there's nothing left to say. With the power of our King I shall destroy you. 
 
**Makiri:**
You will die here, without seeing the last Heroic Spirit. Come forth from the sky of destruction, our Demon God! 
 
**Mordred:**
What!? This presence, this mass magical energy! 
 
**Mash:**
He's summoning a Demon God! Just like the last two! 
 
**Makiri:**
One of the 72 Demon Gods. Demon God Barbatos&mdash;This is the form of our evil. 
 
**Makiri:**
My King has "found" my evilness. The ugliness lurking within me as I desire human salvation. 
 
**Makiri:**
With the epitome of my abomination&mdash;Begone, you who seek to spread good as I once did! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Demon God Barbatos has gone completely silent. We've won. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't let your guard down. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. 
 
**Mordred:**
That was a weird monster. That was hard even for me to fight. 
 
**Mordred:**
Now all that's left is to smash this big thing. Let's do it, Mash, Fujimaru. 
 
**Makiri:**
...It's too late. There's enough Demonic Fog...filling London...already...
 
**Mordred:**
You're still alive? You're tough. 
 
**Makiri:**
Now...Come, my last Heroic Spirit...
 
**Makiri:**
Pioneer of the Stars...who can complete my evil! 
 
**Makiri:**
...Thou who are trapped in a cage of madness...and I the summoner who holds thy chains&mdash;
 
**Makiri:**
Seventh Heaven clad in the great words of power! Come forth from the circle of binding, guardian of scales! 
 
**Mash:**
This is...A Heroic Servant summoning incantation!? 
 
**Mordred:**
Shut your mouth! 
 
**Mordred:**
...Shut up and die. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, his last words were a Heroic Servant summoning incantation. With...the phrase causing Madness Enhancement. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unfortunately, you're right. Mash, Fujimaru, incoming Servant! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He didn't use the full spell, but the Demonic Fog served as the circle and the rest of the incantation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can see the Servant response clearly from here. Mash should feel it too. This is...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Great Hero-class magical energy response. No&mdash;
 
**Makiri:**
See? I sacrificed my life for this summoning, and it succeeded...
 
**Mordred:**
You're still alive!? You're human, right? How can you be so tough&mdash;
 
**Makiri:**
Magical energy of the Holy Grail, amplified by Angrboda...The power of the Demonic fog...all concentrated onto "him"...
 
**Makiri:**
...He has reached the realm of the gods! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The magical energy response is huge! It's coming! 
 
## Section 12: Myth of Thunder and Lightning 
 
**H：???:**
&mdash;You called me, did you not? 
 
**H：???:**
What was it that called me, lightning itself? What was it that called me, the genius? 
 
**H：???:**
A cry? A wish? Good? Evil? 
 
**H：???:**
I see&mdash;It was all of them that brought me here. 
 
**H：???:**
I, the lightning,the genius, Nikola Tesla! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Fascinating. All the scholars together called me? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I, the one who brought a new myth to humanity! I, the one who surpasses Indra, and even Zeus! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahaha&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahahahahahahaha! Fascinating! You have brought me laughter, scholars! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I am a genius, but also a super-human who loved the bizarre! Very well then! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I shall grant your wish! I, the genius and the lightning, shall head to the surface! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahaha! Haha&mdash;Hahahahahahahahaha! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;So, yeah. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
While the explosive magical energy from the summoning was blowing you away or almost burying you under rubble,
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla started heading for the surface. This was just a few minutes ago. 
 
**Mash:**
Nikola Tesla. He's known for being a scientist and inventor, isn't he? 
 
**Mash:**
If you define the modern era as an electricity-based machine civilization, then you can say he created its "foundation. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just like he said,you could call him a Pioneer of the Stars. 
 
**Mash:**
He was supposed to be alive in this era,but he's been summoned as a Servant? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup. Looks like there's similar cases in the past. Where one of them is a human, the other's a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But the human Nikola Tesla has nothing to do with that. We just have to stop his materialization as a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The powerful lightning that he automatically brings to his surroundings will instantly activate the Demonic Fog. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If he gets to a place where the fog is especially dense,what's happening in London will spread explosively. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then it won't just be in London. It'll cover all of Britain. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If that happens,we'll be unable to restore Humanity in this Singularity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Foundation of Humanity will be completely destroyed, and human history will end in this era. 
 
**Mash:**
That's...just what Makiri Zolgen said would happen, isn't it? 
 
**Mordred:**
We just need to give that lightning guy a good beatdown,right? Nice and simple. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Normally a Heroic Spirit that appears from the fog doesn't automatically become our enemy, but...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In his case, Makiri's incantation has had a small effect similar to Madness Enhancement. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's not a pure Berserker. But his mind and actions are limited. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
When I spoke to him via the comms,he did respond&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But there was a sense that his actions were controlled. If we don't stop him he'll automatically go for the Fog. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's stop him! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's chase him. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. By the way...are you hurt? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru's vitals are fine, thanks to Mash promptly giving cover. More importantly...
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. Enemies. Weak ones. Their Master is gone. How faithful of them! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, your orders. We'll destroy the enemy! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
Incoming, it's another homunculus! It's needlessly huge! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe it absorbed too much fog and grew? No, that's not it. Maybe an effect of the Holy Grail? 
 
**Mash:**
Forget that! We have to fight it! Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
More! Dammit, we can't get anywhere like this! 
 
**Mash:**
...Let's try and break through somehow. 
 
**Mash:**
He's supposedly walking,so he can't have gone that far! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If he was going full speed as a Servant, the Demonic Fog would have expanded by now and the world would be doomed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Does that mean...He's trying to help us? Maybe? 
 
**Mordred:**
Enough talking! Let's do this! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
...We're through! Hurry! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The response is coming from right over there! I mean literally! He's right there! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if his actions are controlled, can we assume he's on our side, mentally? ...No, we don't know that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You should assume it'll be a fight. He'll attack anyone who tries to stop him! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger. &mdash;Master, I see him up ahead. It's Nikola Tesla! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You're here! Heroes of hope, reaching out to the future. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Unfortunately, I must fight you! That's how my current existence has been created. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
And what's more&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I have power in this manifestation. So I want to try something I've been thinking about. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? The Demonic Fog is tinged with lightning? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is...not good...The Demonic Fog has enough electricity in it to easily kill a human. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
This is what it means to activate the fog. It absorbs even a Servant's magical energy without limit! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Of course, I'm an exception! The Activated Fog absorbs your magical energy upon approach! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It's possible it will even absorb your Spirit Cores. Now, will you still approach me? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
If you want to defeat me, first you must completely remove this Activated Fog&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
We can't get close&mdash;? Doctor, there's nothing we can do like this. 
 
**Mordred:**
We just need to blow away the fog, right? It's simple. 
 
**Mordred:**
If it absorbs magical energy, it'll work out somehow,even if I blast it at full power. Here I go! 
 
**Mordred:**
Clarent&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Blood Arthur! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Releasing the Noble Phantasm's True Name! Good,a majority of energy was absorbed but the fog dispersed! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not totally gone, so it'll come back soon,but you've brief window where you can fight him! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
That power, that sword&mdash;It is without a doubt Clarent! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahaha! Then that girl is Mordred,an old Heroic Spirit of the Earth. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Perfect! While I'm at it,I'll destroy every Heroic Spirit of Heaven and of Earth! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Old myths are unnecessary! Only "Humans and the Star"Heroic Spirits should exist beyond the age of electricity! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Come then! Remnants of fantasy, ancient myths fading so fleetingly! 
 
**Mordred:**
Let's go, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger! Master, prepare for anti-Servant combat! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;The fog's coming back! We'll have to temporarily retreat, Master! 
 
**Mordred:**
Dammit! The fog's in the way and my magical energy can't reach him! I can't hit him! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hmph. You were doing well, but you're out of time! Hahahaha! Poor ancient Heroic Spirits! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Enough fun for now, then! This genius heads once more for London's skies. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...Oh, yes. While my temperament is a little different than usual...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I am supposed to be a Heroic Spirit that loves humanity. Thus, I will tell you this, human. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
After reaching the surface, I'll head to the densest part of the Demonic Fog, likely the skies above Buckingham Palace. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
A single strike of my lightning there will truly activate the Demonic Fog, and swallow everything&ndash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Everything. Yes, literally all of creation! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It'll destroy the cancer of civilization, strip the land of its ostentation, and burn away this island with inviolate lightning! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
With this Singularity as the origin,the rest of humanity is destined to be incinerated! 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
However! However&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
If you are still not giving up,follow me. Try and stop me, heroes! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You are about to face me, the new God of Thunder, who created an era and a civilization with new mythology. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
So strike me down,with the manifestation of an even newer myth! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
There is no other way! Haha&mdash;hahahaha! Hahahahhahaha! 
 
**Mordred:**
Wait! Nikola Tesla! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...London, huh? It's been so long. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I had aspired to be a British gentleman,and now I'm forced to play the role of world destroyer. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I never would've thought it would happen. However&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha! I, the myth, the pioneer of a new age, am destroying electric civilization and human history itself! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It's ironic, and hilarious! Haha! Hahahahaha! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Come! I proceed to the heavens! Grant me footing leading me to the fated spot in the sky where the Fog is densest! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
The Perkūnas's Ladder answer my call! I shall allow them to take me there! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahahahahaha! Hahaha! Is there no one left who can stop me? 
 
**D：???:**
&mdash;Stop laughing and get your ass down here, then. It's easy, right? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh&mdash;? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hmm. The lightning is crying. This is...
 
**D：???:**
"Golden" shines from a strike of lightning&mdash;
 
**D：???:**
Somebody's calling me. They tell me to destroy evil, and kill the demon. 
 
**D：???:**
Shut up&mdash;
 
**D：???:**
Shut up, shut up! Stop whispering in my ear! I always swing my own axe, and that's that! 
 
**D：???:**
I will beat down any and all evil! &mdash;The shining broad-axe, Golden! 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't want to give you my name, but I will. Sakata Kintoki, Heroic Spirit&mdash;here to save the day. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You in that ugly jacket. Those stairs are a traffic violation. Run along home and cry like a little girl. 
 
## Section 13: Beyond the Fog 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is a "doomed world" situation, isn't it? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My sense of smell is always accurate. If we don't stop you, the world's in trouble, right? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Seems you want to head to the sky. If that happens, the world's all messed up from fog and lightning on top of fire. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Wonderful. Your understanding is as sharp as lightning,and just as quick! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Correct. The world ends if you don't stop me! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But&mdash;Oh, I see. My oh my. Some things are truly interesting. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
A truly fascinating case. The lightning acted as catalyst for the Demonic Fog to summon a new Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Sakata Kintoki, you said? Seems you're another hero opposing the creation of a new legend. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
If you were a Heroic Spirit of Heaven or Earth from old myths, I'd have burned you up with a laugh, but you're...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
"A Heroic Spirit of the Humans," huh? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You're one trying to hinder my path. You're someone willing to fight next to humans. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Isn't that right, Sakata Kintoki? No, I suppose I should call you Mr. Golden. I shall. No, I must. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Yes, you could be none other than Golden! Dazzling, just like plasma! 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You don't look it, but you're quite fun, yourself. I'm glad you're so reasonable! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
A genius always understands what someone says and means. Even with a Madness Enhancement skill cast on him! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But, ha, ha! I cannot hold back. Let me show you a piece of Nikola Tesla's genius! 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Now that's just golden! I'll show you the ace up my sleeve, as well&mdash;
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hi there. Excuse me. Could you stop for a moment? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This is London, right? The city of fog, London, right? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Where's the dreamy double-decker buses? Where's the British Museum, Clock Tower, St. Paul's Cathedral? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
What's with this ominous fog? Why isn't there anyone here, even though it's midday? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
And where are the fish and chips I was looking forward to? And that afternoon tea I was secretly yearning for? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
What about the scones? Clotted cream? Fortnum & Mason's flagship store? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A majority of this area feels abandoned, no? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Mikon? Is London facing swift annihilation or something? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I tagged along to vacation in London so I could rehearse my honeymoon with my Master, and this is what I get? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Now Kintoki, did you trick me? Are you making a fool out of a god? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ah...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
This is&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Unmistakably a Heroic Spirit of Earth. No, of Heaven? This genius can discern this presence. An old legend! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But, ah...But...But&mdash;What a stunningly beautiful lady! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Mikko? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Even if already an inglorious resident of old legends, I,Nikola Tesla, will treat a lovely lady with utmost courtesy. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
A beautiful lady that represents the Orient. It's dangerous here. You should fall back, a bit. 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
What a nice, splendid spirit&mdash;No, I am devoted to my Master, so I cannot. 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But your heart seems not so splendid. Did you get hit with a Madness Enhancement skill? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
And you seem to be wise, as well. How wonderful. It's slightly different, but you're correct, My Lady. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
My words hold no meaning. I merely here to accomplish one act, contrary to my words! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh, how I do hate myself! Because I am a genius,my thoughts and my actions are disconnected&mdash;! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I think that describes most men&mdash;Which is bad. What do you plan to do? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
That depends on you! Lady, I do not mind if the two of you take me on! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Then I'll do just that☆ Now, Kintoki. Let's get this over quickly so I can continue the trip! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, don't worry. I'll continue the trip by myself,so I won't be tying you down, Kintoki☆
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That helps. But wait,you just took a free ride on my summons...
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
How about we talk about this later? Look over there. That hottie over there is already ready to fight, no? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Um, Kintoki? You stopped talking all of a sudden and averted your gaze. What's wrong? (push)
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Your face&mdash;
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Huh? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's way too close to mine&mdash;No, If you can, stick to support. I'll do the punching. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It'll be a great fight. We're both men of lightning. Let's make some sparks fly, Nikola Tesla! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm? It looks like Nikola Tesla has stopped. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Suddenly, for some reason. He shouldn't have reached skies above Buckingham Palace yet. 
 
**Mordred:**
That means we can still catch up. That's good. I might get a chance for another fight! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, we should head to the surface now! Let's hurry, Master! 
 
**Mordred:**
And now there's a big group coming this way! They should just run away now that they're free! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Multiple hostile signals! Fight your way through the battles! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&mdash;I see why you're the son of the lightning god! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You're doing great in the Activated Fog! A normal Servant would have had their Spirit Core eaten away! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I expect nothing less from a Heroic Spirit of Humans invited by my Lightning Fog, you stand for man's hope! But, haha, hahaha! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Your Spirit Core&mdash;There's already some cracks forming! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You won't last much longer! At this rate,you will only be burned by my lightning, and shatter! 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well if that isn't golden&mdash;You should calm down that fog a bit more! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Can you stop ordering me around!? Only my Master can speak that way to me! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Besides, I've been providing support this entire time. Spells just don't work well on that fog. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Your face is so close! ...Come on! Fox, I'm counting on you, so let's do this! 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're our last chance! God of Arms, I seek aid facing enemies! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hmm, am I being worshipped? Is this worship? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Mm, truly beautiful...That smile is like a sparkle from the sun, burning my heart! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Foxy Lady! You may be able to stand alongside my legend! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Mikko? There's someone worshipping me here, too? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'm really popular around here&mdash;W-Wait, no. My Master has to be the one. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A-Anyway, keep up your support! It's almost time. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm gonna ruin that nice suit of his. Now&mdash;time to slam you with my super attack! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
&mdash;I'll blow you away! Special move: 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Golden Spark! 
 
**Mash:**
...We're at the surface, Senpai! 
 
**Mordred:**
Hmm? Somebody's here. A man and a woman. They're not dead, so are they Servants? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like they're Servants that appeared from the fog. I see two of them. They don't look like enemies. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, are you guys the heroes he was talking about? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Mordred:**
It doesn't matter if we're heroes or not. More importantly, it sounds like you fought him. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah...I can tell you this. We got rid of "all" that pain in the ass fog. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Now it's up to you guys. I'll let you grab the glory...or whatever...Gonna rest. Whew...
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Well, with so much magical energy drained from you as you fought, utter exhaustion and near death are to be expected. 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But you did wonderfully. You truly are one of Raikou's Four Kings, whose might shakes the heavens. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You too. Thanks for the help! Whew...
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...But you just looked away, didn't you? You did. Why? Is your worship a lie? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Eh, I did not. Sure you're not imagining it? 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(Those boobs! I can see your boobs, Fox! I don't know where am I supposed to look, get it!? )
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
???
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, this is a big help. We've got a chance now. Without the Activated Fog we can fight him head on! 
 
**Mordred:**
Now we just have to catch up and slay him. Okay,let's follow him, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are we going up those stairs? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, they're made with a type of magecraft...It seems, anyway. We can walk on them. 
 
**Mordred:**
It's scary to think about them disappearing halfway up. But we'll deal with that if it happens. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Looks like there's no time to rest. 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, we're gonna run up those stairs! Even if they might disappear partway! 
 
**Mash:**
That's probably a magical staircase created by Nikola Tesla. Who knows how long it will last...
 
**Mordred:**
I'll take care of that if it happens. There's no time to waste, just like you said. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm counting on you guys! Don't screw this up! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Huh? Is that all we get to do? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This feels like when you trip the metal detector at a security checkpoint! 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;We caught up to him! This time, he's ours! 
 
**Mash:**
I've sighted Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla once more. He's walking towards the sky above Buckingham Palace! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We defeat him here! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Activated Fog that was around him
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. The Activated Fog is gone. That golden Servant was right! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
So you're here&mdash;So you truly will try to build a new legend? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But sadly, that's impossible. Even without Activated Fog, my lightning is far too strong. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Why? Because I am a genius. Why? Because I am the lightning. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What is a god&mdash;Yes, what is a god? A god is the lightning. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Since ancient times, many men have believed this,and in fact...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Even setting Zeus and Indra aside, it is indeed a god. Lightning, a divine power striking from the heavens. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Behold. The light I bring to the earth is great power itself! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Energy guiding a new electric, consumer civilization! My lightning is the final farewell to the old era and its myths! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It is a new myth! It is "my light," a gift unto humanity! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Now,I shall display to all of you! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&ndash;System Keraunos! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Enemy Servant defeated! 
 
**Mordred:**
My lightning won! Too bad, Nikola Tesla! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha...! Hahaha, Hahahahahaha! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
No, I don't think it's bad at all! I am a Pioneer of the Stars! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I would never truly wish for humanity's end. The Heroic Spirits of Heaven and Earth are still a nuisance&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But continuation of the world means continuation of my lightning civilization! Thank you, you who desire new myths! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Heroes of hope! You have done well to defeat me, the modern Zeus! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
And so now it is time for me to return to the Throne&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha! Hahahahaha! Farewell, all of you&mdash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&mdash;Farewell! 
 
**Mash:**
...The enemy Servant has completely disappeared. 
 
**Mordred:**
Sheesh, he said whatever and did whatever he pleased until the very end. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've confirmed Nikola Tesla's annihilation. Good work. That should take care of things. 
 
**Mash:**
What we're standing on was formed by his magical energy,so it should become unstable shortly. 
 
**Mash:**
It's a very powerful effect, so it shouldn't disappear immediately...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
First we need to get safely back to the ground. This should take care of London's problems&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh. Right. Crap. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hmm? 
 
**Mash:**
What is it, Doctor? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think we forgot something. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...What about the Holy Grail? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Oh&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. We forgot to get the Holy Grail from Angrboda. N-No, it's not our fault. We were in a hurry. Yeah! 
 
**Mordred:**
You can take your time getting it. The only enemies left are wimps. 
 
**Mash:**
Yeah, that's right. I don't know how I feel about going back underground. 
 
**Mordred:**
Let's go get it now, then. There's no sense going back to Jekyll's apartment. 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Wait. Looks like something's showed up after all. What is it? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A high-density magical energy response? It's so big I can see it in the Demonic Fog...What the...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's different from Nikola Tesla's response,but the fog is gathering above Buckingham palace! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Something real bad is coming! Be careful, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mordred:**
It doesn't matter what comes! I'll hack them all apart! 
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Bring it! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Altria:**
&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
!!! 
 
**Mash:**
...That's......No, she is definitely...King Arthur! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's absorbing the remaining Demonic Fog as she manifests! This is bad! There's so much magical energy! 
 
**Mash:**
It looks like she has a spear, not a sword...A swirling black lance...what twisted magical energy...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You feel the magical energy? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wasn't your detection weaker? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I can tell...Magical energy so big I can sense it even with Demonic Fog...
 
**Mash:**
It's similar to when Nikola Tesla manifested. But it's more clear&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
I can feel her animosity. It's a blind rage and hatred, like a Berserker! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is she under the effect of Makiri Zolgen's incantation? Then even if we can talk to her, we'll still have to fight. 
 
**Mordred:**
...We probably can't talk. That's King Arthur, ready to slay her foes. 
 
**Mordred:**
Why...Why are you appearing now? If you're saving Londinium, you should have come sooner...
 
**Mordred:**
...No, maybe it's different. 
 
**Mordred:**
Maybe you're here to kill me. Do you not like the idea of me saving Londinium? 
 
**Mordred:**
Do you hate me that much? Is that why you've got the spear that killed me&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The spear that killed Mordred? Th-That's a Divine Construct, said to rival the holy sword! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rhongomyniad, the holy spear! The legendary spear that's said to hold the two sides of the world together! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You already fought one battle with a powerful Servant. You need to retreat, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mordred:**
No, not happening. King Arthur has decided we are enemies. 
 
**Mordred:**
There's no getting away. We have to fight. 
 
**Mordred:**
...No, you can run if you want. But there's a 90% chance you'll get blown away. 
 
**Mordred:**
Besides, I'm not running.... I'm not turning my back on my father. 
 
**Mordred:**
King Arthur is right in front of me! So there's only one thing for me to do! 
 
**Mordred:**
I'll fight you! If you hate me, even as a Heroic Spirit! 
 
**Mordred:**
I'll rebel against you as many times as I have to! &mdash;Arthur Pendragon! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's no good! We can't stop Mordred! I guess we have to fight...Good luck, you two! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right, Master! ...Beginning combat! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jekyll:**
I just got word from Dr. Roman. The operation was a success! 
 
**Jekyll:**
They defeated Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla,as well as another Servant that appeared from the Fog. 
 
**Jekyll:**
And just now, they succeeded in removing the Holy Grail from Angrboda. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...
 
**Jekyll:**
Huh? Is it just you? Where's Andersen and Shakespeare&mdash;
 
**Jekyll:**
Oh, I see. That's right. The Grail's been recovered. Singularity is fixed. Then, yup. 
 
**Jekyll:**
The era is being restored. Everything that happened here will disappear. 
 
**Jekyll:**
All the Servants will disappear,and our memories will probably change as well. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh, uh, uh...
 
**Jekyll:**
Yes...Yes. I see. Just this once, I think I understand what you're saying. 
 
**Fran:**
...Uh...
 
**Jekyll:**
...Yes, you're right. It is a little sad. 
 
**Mordred:**
Well, you know&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Good work. You guys helped with a lot. 
 
**Mordred:**
Londinium is saved. No one other than me could trample it. 
 
**Mordred:**
And they all lived happily ever after. Bye. 
 
**Mash:**
...Um, Mordred. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hmm? 
 
**Mash:**
I'll tell you...one thing. That last Servant was clearly out of control. 
 
**Mash:**
It was probably the unique result of the Demonic Fog and Makiri Zolgen's last incantation. 
 
**Mash:**
It didn't come here for any special reason or anything like that, I think. 
 
**Mordred:**
...What? Are you trying to make me feel better? 
 
**Mordred:**
Give it up. I don't want to end this by killing you. 
 
**Mash:**
No, that's not it. I...No...That's not...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She said what she wanted to say. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
...Haha, I get it! I see! That's what I've said so many times! 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, you're right. You've got me there. 
 
**Mordred:**
Okay, I won't kill you then. Dammit, I should've kept my mouth shut around Fran. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh? Isn't that a little too kind for the Treacherous Knight? 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I understood your character as being someone who slays anyone who offers pity, regardless of who it may be. 
 
**Andersen:**
Nope. She's just easily taken in by a certain type of person. You can tell by looking at Fran, right? 
 
**Mordred:**
...You're showing up after it's all over, huh? Fine. Line up so I can chop your heads off. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh? I came to help you out of this latest danger,and I'm finding a bunch of weirdos. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Are those two Servants? Do you need my help? 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hahh, Hahh...Oh, jeez. Hold up, Kintoki. You're a little too fast&mdash;Geh. 
 
**Andersen:**
Hmph. I think I may have seen those fox ears somewhere before...
 
**Andersen:**
Saber, if you want to kill Shakespeare, very well. But first, listen to me. 
 
**Andersen:**
You'll want to defeat that fox-eared girl first. I don't know why, but I can see she's a hassle to deal with! 
 
**Mordred:**
I'm killing you, too! 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
You really have it out for me,don't you? Hmmph, precocious brat! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha. Sounds like you're busy. Well, the case is closed, so this is fit for a grand finale. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Everybody's so friendly. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Doctor, we need to recover the Holy Grail. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, right. We need to finish recovering the Holy Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's no more threats in this era, so I wasn't...Wait. What's this response!? 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Everyone, be careful! There's some kind of distortion in the underground space! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"Something" is coming! It's an unknown phenomenon! Not a Servant manifestation! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unknown? No, it's actually more like a Rayshift? But that's impossible. Only Chaldea has that technology! 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? ...Senpai, something is strange. I have no anomalies, but I'm shivering&mdash;terribly&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...The space is opening! Here it comes! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**C：???:**
Demon Marshal Gilles de Rais. Imperial Founder Romulus. Hero Spy Jason. And Divine Scholar Nikola Tesla. 
 
**C：???:**
I thought they would be somewhat useful&mdash;But they spoiled my fun as they couldn't even clean house. 
 
**C：???:**
Stupidity. Such stupidity. Humans really do degrade with the passage of time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Dammit! Sheba won't stabilize! I can only get audio! What happened!? What's going on, Mash!? 
 
**Mash:**
I-I don't know. There's a shadow that looks human,slowly walking towards us&mdash;
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Get back, lady. That thing's bad news. It ain't something a good little girl should see. 
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So it seems. I'll be leaving too. With only two tails, even seeing it is enough to taint me. 
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(No, you're probably fine, right? Shouldn't you be going to the front? )
 
**Mordred:**
&mdash;Hey. What is this insane magical energy? It's a hell of a lot bigger than a dragon. It's like&mdash;
 
**Shakespeare:**
One of the demons or angels in the ancient stories. No, perhaps even greater. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
I was not born a mage but as a petty Caster I can understand. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
This magical energy is infinite. This domination crushes its surroundings merely by existing. 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Truly, truly a created being worthy of being called God! No, perhaps it is even God itself! 
 
**Shakespeare:**
Am I wrong, my friend Andersen? I think it's time for us to be going! 
 
**Andersen:**
Why do you always exaggerate so? There's all types of gods. Anyway, the only god I fear is the god of editors. 
 
**Andersen:**
...Though I do agree it's time to run. I didn't expect to see the big boss at this stage. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The big boss!? What does that mean!? Fujimaru, tell me what's going on! 
 
**C：???:**
I see. Like me, only your voice reaches them. 
 
**C：???:**
Chaldea is isolated from the temporal axis,and so it's become a base that no one can find. 
 
**C：???:**
My eyes see everything&mdash;and all possible futures,but even they have trouble perceiving Chaldea. 
 
**C：???:**
That's why you survive. Pathetically, shamelessly, and uselessly. 
 
**C：???:**
Intolerant of a history of destruction already decided,a pitiful boat still adrift in the sea of void. 
 
**C：???:**
That is what you are, Chaldea,and what you are, Fujimaru. 
 
**C：???:**
A stain upon the scorched ashes of human history. The name of the only fools left who would defy "my" deeds. 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Doctor,what we're about to see is&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you the "King" that Lev talked about? 
 

---

 
**C：???:**
Hmm? I thought you already had the answer? Are you so like monkeys that such a thing has to be taught? 
 
**C：???:**
But very well. I've taken a liking to your stupidity. If you wish to ask, I shall answer you. 
 
**C：???:**
I am the final destination you seek. The one who commands the 72 Demon Gods, and will destroy humanity from his throne. 
 
**C：???:**
My name is Solomon. Among the Heroic Spirits,I stand above them all as one of the "Grand" seven. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
S&mdash;Solomon!? Are you sure that's what he said, Mash!? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, I'm sure. 
 
**Mash:**
He said he was Solomon...Same as the king of ancient Israel, who was alive in the 10th century B. C. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No...Is it really Solomon? But...But that's impossible&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
Heh. I guess we've got a big name for a guest, huh? So what? Are you a Servant too? 
 
**Mordred:**
You were summoned as a Heroic Spirit,and decided to use your 2nd life to destroy humanity? 
 
**Solomon:**
No, Knight of Londinium. I am indeed a Heroic Spirit, but no man will ever summon me. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? 
 
**Solomon:**
Do not think me the same rank as you incompetents. After death, I revived by my own power to be a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
D-Did he say...he revived by his own power!? 
 
**Solomon:**
I am a Heroic Spirit, and also a living being. Thus, no Master commands me. 
 
**Solomon:**
I started this matter of my own will. In order to eliminate all you humans&mdash;
 
**Solomon:**
Trash who's continuing along its foolish history. You are the sole and greatest waste of this universe. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You think you can do that!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You can't destroy the world! 
 

---

 
**Solomon:**
I can. I have the means,the will, and the reality. 
 
**Solomon:**
Your eras have been swept away already,by my 72 Demon Gods that cross over time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Cross over time...So those Demon Gods really were the demons in the Lemegeton? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But they're nothing like those in folklore! King Solomon's familiars can't be such ugly meat monsters! 
 
**Solomon:**
How sad. You exist at the far end of time,and yet your interpretation is ancient. 
 
**Solomon:**
The 72 Demon Gods took physical form and were reborn. That is why they can anchor themselves in any era. 
 
**Solomon:**
The Demon Gods are wedges halting this planet's rotation. The spiraling band of light in the sky is my Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mash:**
Spiraling band of light in the sky Does he mean...that ring of light we see in every era&mdash;
 
**Solomon:**
Indeed. That is my Third Noble Phantasm. "Ars Almadel Salomonis. "
 
**Solomon:**
Each ray in the band carries the same heat as a holy sword. Light equivalent to weaving together hundreds of millions of the holy sword...
 
**Solomon:**
...held by King Arthur&mdash;the Servant you played with. In other words&mdash;an Anti-Humanity Noble Phantasm. 
 
**Mordred:**
Tch...Hundreds of millions of times the heat of Father's holy sword&mdash; That's what you're using to incinerate time!? 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;Hmph. You'll never see it, so I've no intention of answering. 
 
**Solomon:**
I've answered your question. Now it's my turn, survivors of Chaldea. 
 
**Mordred:**
He wants a fight! Get ready, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mordred:**
He's the guy behind all this, right!? So our only option is to kill him here! 
 
**Mash:**
B-But&mdash;That Servant...we can't&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, get a hold of yourself! Stay strong and focus on the enemy! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No matter who they are, they're a Servant, right!? So you can win! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Heroic Spirit within you was chosen by the Holy Grail! He's a Heroic Spirit who won't be outranked by Solomon! 
 
**D：Solomon:**
Hah&mdash;the rank of a Heroic Spirit? Do you really think that matters at all? 
 
**D：Solomon:**
Ignorance is a sin. I thought some knowledge was there,but your commander seems to be a mage of little worth. 
 
**D：Solomon:**
The only one I've any interest in now is you, girl with the shield. 
 
**D：Solomon:**
Now let's have a fun little chat. 
 
**D：Solomon:**
I'll do you a special favor. Out of respect for your pure heart, I'll only summon "four of them. "
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Solomon:**
Do you see now? This is the inevitable result of a mere Heroic Spirit trying to challenge me. 
 
**Mash:**
...Doctor, use the Rayshift. We're going to be wiped out! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't do it! The field around him is blocking the Rayshift anchor! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As long as Solomon's there,I can't bring you back! 
 
**Mash:**
...At least...I can try to save Senpai&mdash;
 
**Mordred:**
That bastard is boasting! 
 
**Mordred:**
But it's no bluff...Our ranks don't matter. His energy output is so much greater. 
 
**Mordred:**
What the hell are you made of? 
 
**Solomon:**
It's just like you said. It's not our ranks as Heroic Spirits. Our vessels, our Classes are what separate us. 
 
**Solomon:**
Now burn, with the rest of the garbage. 
 
**Solomon:**
Heroic Spirit Mordred, Kingslayer. I will take my time to incinerate you thoroughly. 
 
**Andersen:**
...This is crazy. Just blocking him once did this to me? Figures I can't stand up to you as a Caster. 
 
**Mordred:**
Brat!? What are you&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
Just a whim. Don't worry about it. I owe you for all the work you've done. 
 
**Solomon:**
...You're still alive, scribbler? 
 
**Solomon:**
I thought I cleaned you up with the rest of the rabble. I'm amazed you survived, as weak as you are. 
 
**Andersen:**
Hmph. I don't like physical labor, so I focused on watching. But it looks like I can't do that anymore. 
 
**Andersen:**
But&mdash;I see through you, Solomon. I see what you really are, and the truth behind your exceptional nature. 
 
**Solomon:**
Oh? Very well. Speak then, poet. If your words please me, I'll grant you an easy death. 
 
**Andersen:**
Yeah, listen well you imbecile. This is what was written in the Clock Tower's records. 
 
**Andersen:**
The Heroic Spirit Summons belong to the Counter Force. And the Counter Force is what protects humanity. 
 
**Andersen:**
They manifest in seven vessels,to fight "just one" enemy. 
 
**Andersen:**
What is that enemy? What else? The great disaster that threatens our world! 
 
**Andersen:**
It is the avatar of the end, which destroys not this planet,but humanity and the civilization it has built! 
 
**Andersen:**
It was born from civilization, and devours it&mdash;It is none other than a self-inflicted apoptosis. 
 
**Andersen:**
To defeat it,the greatest of the Heroic Spirits are summoned. 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;That's right. The seven Heroic Spirits are messengers from heaven, sent to destroy a certain wickedness. 
 
**Solomon:**
Seven strongest from that era to protect humanity. The first seven at the pinnacle of Heroic Spirits. 
 
**Solomon:**
The Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual was originally an ultimate spell meant to save humanity. 
 
**Solomon:**
The summoning system you use&mdash;the Holy Grail War is a degraded form of it, meant to serve human purposes. 
 
**Mordred:**
Wha&mdash;You're saying we're degraded? 
 
**Andersen:**
Don't fall for his taunts, Mordred. It's not an issue of rank, but of vessel and authority. 
 
**Andersen:**
He is simply a Heroic Spirit manifested in a vessel one rank above our own. 
 
**Andersen:**
If we are weapons meant to fight individuals,he is a weapon meant to fight the world&mdash;
 
**Andersen:**
He stands at the top of all Heroic Spirits of his alignment. In other words, he is a Servant with a "Grand" vessel. 
 
**Solomon:**
Yes. You have done well to reach the truth! 
 
**D：Solomon:**
I am the King of Kings, the Caster of Casters! You shall refer to me as this! 
 
**D：Solomon:**
&mdash;The Grand Caster, Mage King Solomon! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Grand Class!? Is he saying he was chosen by the Root!? 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;Now then. Take your reward, poet. I shall tear you into a hundred pieces and burn you to a crisp. 
 
**Andersen:**
Ggg&mdash;Gggawaahhh! 
 
**Mordred:**
...You bastard. 
 
**Solomon:**
Ordinary Servant, you're an utterly useless tool unless summoned by the living. 
 
**Solomon:**
You lack the true freedom I possess. Do you now see the wall between us that you can never cross? 
 
**Mordred:**
Tch&mdash;Hah. You're one to talk,considering you lost four Grails already. 
 
**Mordred:**
You're only here because you're panicking that Fujimaru took half of your Grails, right? 
 
**Mordred:**
Only losers whine when they get beat, you know? 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;Are you the greatest fool in history? 
 
**Solomon:**
I've lost four Grails? No. It will only matter if I lose them all. 
 
**Solomon:**
One Grail, or six, it makes no difference to me. Fujimaru is far from a threat. 
 
**Solomon:**
It's time for me to go. I wasted more time than I thought. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh!? You're leaving? Why did you even come here!? 
 
**Solomon:**
It was nothing more than a whim. Why? 
 
**Solomon:**
Sometimes after finishing a book, you go to the bathroom before picking up the next, right? That's all this was. 
 
**Mordred:**
What? You're saying you came to piss on us!? 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;Hah. 
 
**Solomon:**
Hahaha, Gwahahaha! 
 
**Solomon:**
That's right! That's exactly right! But you're worth less than piss! 
 
**Solomon:**
I don't care about you. I could kill you here, or not, and not care at all. 
 
**Solomon:**
Do you understand? I'm not letting you go. You weren't worth looking at in the first place. 
 
**Solomon:**
But&mdash;Hmph. But if you can remove all seven Singularities...
 
**Solomon:**
...Then I will consider you"a matter I must deal with. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are we...saved? I hate to have him let us go, but it's best to just&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, Fujimaru!? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you doing this!? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is incinerating the world fun!? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;Oh. That's a surprising reaction, human. 
 
**Solomon:**
You ask if it's fun? You ask me if destroying humanity is fun? 
 
**D：Solomon:**
Oh&mdash;Of course! Of course! Of course! Of course! It's the greatest fun in the world! 
 
**D：Solomon:**
If it wasn't fun,would I take my time killing each one of you? 
 
**D：Solomon:**
I'm having fun. Your deaths make me happy. 
 
**D：Solomon:**
Your end pleases me. Your final gasps bring me more joy than anything! 
 
**D：Solomon:**
And,this is the greatest salvation you could find. 
 
**D：Solomon:**
Because only I alone can make good use of every single human being&mdash;! 
 
**Mordred:**
Get back, Fujimaru! There's no point in talking to him! He's rotten to the core! 
 
**Mash:**
...Mage King Solomon. You're no different than Lev Lainur. 
 
**Mash:**
You have no gratitude towards life. You enjoy toying with the lives of humans and of the planet! 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;
 
**Solomon:**
Girl, speak not of life as a mere human. When death is inevitable for you, your view has no value. 
 
**Solomon:**
Gratitude towards life? That's my question for you. 
 
**Solomon:**
What have you done for the last 2,000 years? You've continuously died, and continuously done nothing. 
 
**Solomon:**
You are sentient creatures who failed to conquer death. And yet you retain your fear of it. 
 
**Solomon:**
If you cannot conquer death,you should have abandoned your fear of it. 
 
**Solomon:**
If you understand death to be a shameful, terrifying thing, then you should throw away your sentience! 
 
**Solomon:**
It's pathetic. Simply pathetic. You're no different either, Master of Chaldea. 
 
**Solomon:**
Why do you fight? Knowing your life will end. Knowing it has ended. 
 
**Solomon:**
Why do you cling to life,when you know that your future holds no salvation? 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Solomon:**
You are so young, human. You, Fujimaru, are humanity's final Master. 
 
**Solomon:**
And this is my one warning to you. 
 
**Solomon:**
Know that giving up on everything here is the easiest way for you to live. 
 
**Solomon:**
&mdash;Burn, and leave not even ash. That is your future. 
 
**Mordred:**
...This is the end. I feel unsatisfactory, though we got the Grail back. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm sorry. 
 
**Mordred:**
Idiot. Don't you apologize. I'm the one who's stupid. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You're right. 
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. I haven't been this down since my Father's spear&mdash; No, never mind. Never mind. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
But well, we saved London. Not bad, considering who I am. 
 
**Mordred:**
What I hate is that it's ending here. Honestly, I wanted to go with you guys...
 
**Mordred:**
But I'm at my limit, as you can see. With the Singularity gone, there's no place for me. 
 
**Mordred:**
I was summoned here by the Grail's fog. Without a Master, I have to disappear. 
 
**Mordred:**
...I hate to say it, but he's right. We can't fight unless we're summoned. 
 
**Mordred:**
That's the limit of a Heroic Spirit, and a Servant. 
 
**Mordred:**
In every era, the ones who build things...are always people living on the cutting edge of the future. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Mordred
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Living people...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah. That's why&mdash;you're going to get there, Fujimaru. 
 
**Mordred:**
You'll reach the place we can't go. You'll cross over the seven Grails and reach the end of time. 
 
**Mordred:**
And then you'll corner that bastard Grand Caster. It's something only you can do. 
 
**Mash:**
...Mordred. 
 
**Mordred:**
Don't make that face, Mash. I don't like that Shield Bastard, but you're different. 
 
**Mordred:**
Someday we'll meet again. When that happens, I'll help you. 
 
**Mordred:**
Bye, Fujimaru. Even someone like me was able to save London. 
 
**Mordred:**
So with a little bit of work,you'll be able to save the world. 
 
**Mash:**
...All Servant responses are lost. Senpai, our Order in this era is complete...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahem. Test, test. Yes! Finally got video. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You two okay? You're okay, right? None of your vitals seem off. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Demonic Fog is back to normal fog. There's nothing left for you in that era. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm starting the Rayshift now. Anything left for you to do? Nothing, right? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay, initiating Rayshift! Congrats on completing your mission! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Welcome back, you two. You're both fine...well, maybe not. But I'm glad you're here. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
By the way, why are you here, Da Vinci? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um, where's Dr. Roman? 
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Romani? Oh, Romani. He's...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
How...How could this happen? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
He's a mess, as you can see. Go snap him out of it, would you? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get a grip, Doctor! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You really are a chicken, huh Doctor? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ywaah!? W-When did you two get here!? ...Oh, right. Leonardo did it for me...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Sorry. You were the ones in danger. It's just...It was such a shock...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right, right. Enough gloom. They'll get really tired of it soon, you know? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-Yeah...I'm...Sorry, Mash, Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I should've done a forced Rayshift earlier,but my judgment was too slow...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's okay. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You couldn't help it. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But if Solomon had really tried to kill you...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Wah...I'm...I'm no good! 
 
**Mash:**
...Doctor. No, stop staring at the ground. 
 
**Mash:**
We are able to continue our mission because you are here. 
 
**Mash:**
It's true that you're a bit of a coward,and a pessimist, too. 
 
**Mash:**
You're a chicken. And kind of a wimp for a guy...
 
**Mash:**
Also, your hobbies are far too introverted,and you're way too dependent on that cyber-idol. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh...
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Um...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, show some mercy...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
But&mdash;The staff left at Chaldea can only do their best because you're doing your best. 
 
**Mash:**
When Chaldea was bombed, you were the one who got the power back up in the fire, saved the survivors, and took command. 
 
**Mash:**
You have only one fault. You give yourself just a bit too little credit. 
 
**Mash:**
Chaldea is only here because of Romani Archaman. You saved the lives of everyone here. 
 
**Mash:**
That's what I think. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's right. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You said "what you were thinking. "
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Senpai. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thanks, Mash, Fujimaru. Then, I don't have time to be depressed. Yeah. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We know who's behind this all now. There must be some reason for his extreme strength. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's continue the mission. We'll fix the remaining Singularities and stop the world and future from incineration. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No matter what that man,Mage King Solomon, tries to do. 
 
**Mash:**
The Grand Caster. He is our true enemy&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Next time we win! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We won't lose again. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah! That's the spirit, Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, it's a little late to say this,but great work this time, guys! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We'll handle the cleanup. You guys get some rest, ASAP. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
When you wake up, it'll be time for the Fifth Singularity. See you then! 
 
**Mash:**
...We've reached our rooms. Senpai, thanks for your endless work. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You too, Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
No. I'm a Demi-Servant. Physically, I'm fine. 
 
**Mash:**
If you can call exhaustion and drained magical energy...tired...then maybe I am tired. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's fine. I'm not that tired. 
 
**Mash:**
Um...I'm sorry. I meant that more as an idiom. 
 
**Mash:**
And I do think you're tired. Get some rest in your room. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Um. I'm sorry. There was something I had to talk to you about. 
 
**Mash:**
...What did you think about what Solomon said? About making use of humanity. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's stupid. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...What did you think? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I...I couldn't say that he was wrong. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't understand it myself. But there was something in his words I can't ignore...
 
**Mash:**
Life is meaningless, and the future holds no salvation...It sounds so pessimistic, but he was full of hope. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry. The battle just got started, and I'm being weird. 
 
**Mash:**
Good night, Master. I hope I see you bright and full of energy tomorrow.
